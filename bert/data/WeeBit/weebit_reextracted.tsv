Atmosphere and setting are vital components of a piece of fiction. The atmosphere or setting of a story can be shown explicitly or implicitly. This Revision Bite covers:	5
"Something that is explicit is out in the open, clear and obvious. Explicit meaning is the easiest to pick out from a text. Sometimes a writer wants it to be obvious that the atmosphere or setting of a text is good, bad, dangerous, happy, sad, and so on. Look at the extract from Floella Benjamin's autobiography, 'Coming to England'. She is describing the family home in Trinidad, in the Caribbean. While you are reading the extract, think about what impression you get of the room and how the writer creates this. Some phrases have been put in bold to help you. This room was my mother's pride and joy. Its brilliant white curtains always smelt fresh and the mahogany furniture was always highly polished, as was the wooden floor. My sister and I spent many hours polishing that room from as far back as I can remember. We had to do the polishing before we left for school each day. The comfortable wooden chairs in the room were draped with crisp white headrests and the round table, which we ate from on Sundays and other special occasions, had a doiley in its centre, on which sat a glass of glorious fresh flowers. 'Coming to England' - Floella Benjamin We can tell straight away that this is a special room. It is described as her mother's ""pride and joy"". It sounds clean and smart, with ""crisp white headrests"" on the chairs and a ""doily"" on the table. The room is also pleasant and attractive to be in, with its ""comfortable wooden chairs"" and ""glass of glorious fresh flowers""."	5
Take a look at the extract below from Tricia Holford's book, 'Fly Away Home'. The extract describes a pair of lions in two settings, their natural home in Africa and in captivity at a rooftop bar in Tenerife. The two lions lay on their backs in the shade of an acacia tree, their massive paws limp and relaxed. We had been watching them for 20 minutes when the male slowly stood up, stretched, and padded over to a clearing. He began to roar. It was a deep, heart-stopping roar which echoed along the ancient African Valley. It was an announcement that he, Raffi, had arrived and it was his territory now. Slowly he turned to his mate and lay peacefully beside her. It was quiet once more. It was a dramatic contrast to my first encounter with them on a Tenerife rooftop in 1994. That image of two thin, grubby lions pacing back and forth in their tiny cage is forever etched on my memory. The corrugated iron roof turned the cage into an oven. Without a water bowl in sight, the only features in the cage were an old rubbish bin and narrow sleeping shelves with nails sticking out. For five years Raffi and Anthea had mentally survived in these conditions â€“ how? I never believed I would one day see them in their ancestral home. Explain the differences between the two lions': in the wild and in captivity. Try to use quotations to support your ideas.	5
"Something that is implicit is inferred - it's suggested, but not openly stated. Implicit meaning can be harder to figure out than explicit meaning. Writers like to be clever and draw you into their text. It's up to you to make your mind up about a setting, in just the same way that it's up to you what to make of a new place you visit. Writers often use language in clever ways to build up a sense of atmosphere and setting. Take a look at the following extract from Robert Westall's novel, 'Urn Burial'. Ralph has been captured by an alien race... This was the worst nightmare yet. He was standing with his back pressed against a smooth wall cold as ice. The cold nibbled at his buttocks and legs; it ran up and down the knobbles of his spine, making him shiver; it invaded his lungs so he could hardly breathe; he felt he had been shivering a long time. 'Urn Burial' - Robert Westall In the extract, the writer intends to create a very creepy, sinister atmosphere. The way that he describes Ralph's imprisonment makes it sound very unpleasant. He is ""pressed"" against a wall that is ""cold as ice"" and the cold is creeping into every part of his body, making him shiver. Ralph also feels as if he can ""hardly breathe"" because of the cold. The writer also uses figurative language. The simile; ""a smooth wall cold as ice"", helps the reader relate to Ralph as they will know what ice feels like. The writer also uses personification; the cold ""nibbled"" at Ralph, it ""ran up and down"" his back and ""invaded"" his lungs. This makes the cold sound as if it were alive, running over and into Ralph, trying to eat away at him. This adds to the feeling that he has been overpowered and is in danger."	5
"Now's your chance to see if you can spot implicit meaning. Read the following extract from a short story by HG Wells. Decide: Make at least two points about each. A few words and phrases have been put in bold to give you some clues. When you have finished, click on the 'Check ideas' button to see our ideas. The long, draughty, subterranean [which means underground] passage was chilly and dusty, and my candle flared and made the shadows cower and quiver. The echoes rang up and down the spiral staircase, and a shadow came sweeping up after me, and one fled before me into the darkness overhead. I came along the landing and stopped there for a moment, listening to a rustling sound that I fancied I heard; then, satisfied of the absolute silence, I pushed open the baize-covered door and stood in the corridor. 'The Red Room' - HG Wells What sort of atmosphere is Wells trying to create and how does he use figurative language to do this? The writer is trying to create an atmosphere of fear and tension in the extract. He describes the passage as being ""draughty"" and mentions that it is underground. This makes it seem creepy and ghostly. The fact that the character only has a candle to light his way makes the story seem old-fashioned, and also creates drama because we know that the draught could blow it out! The way the echoes ""rang up and down"" and the fact that the man stops because he thinks he hears a sound, adds to the ghostly effects. The shadows also help to create a sinister atmosphere as they flicker around and make it even harder for the man to see what's ahead. The writer uses figurative language such as personification to describe them. He says that they ""cower and quiver"", come ""sweeping up"" and that they ""fled"". All of this makes them sound alive, or perhaps like ghosts. The words used are all linked with fear, so that even the shadows seem to be afraid of what's in the corridor. This is very eerie and helps to create a very tense atmosphere."	5
"As well as having lots of ideas, you need to explain them clearly. An effective way of doing this is to PEE. PEE stands for: Read through the following extract. How does the writer create an atmosphere of cold and loneliness? Dark spruce forest frowned on either side the frozen waterway. The trees had been stripped by a recent wind of their white covering of frost, and they seemed to lean towards each other, black and ominous, in the fading light. A vast silence reigned over the land. The land itself was a desolation, lifeless, without movement, so lone and cold that the spirit of it was not even that of sadness. There was a hint in it of laughter, but of a laughter more terrible than any sadness - a laughter that was mirthless as the smile of the sphinx, a laughter cold as the frost and partaking of the grimness of infallibility. It was the masterful and incommunicable wisdom of eternity laughing at the futility of life and the effort of life. It was the Wild, the savage, frozen-hearted Northland Wild. 'White Fang' - Jack London Check your ideas against ours. Point: The extract describes a cold, empty landscape. Evidence: The text states that the trees have been ""stripped by a recent wind of their white covering of frost"". The land is described as ""desolate"" and it contains ""a laughter more terrible than any sadness"". Explanation: This suggests that the place is completely isolated. The fact that it seems to be full of terrible laughter suggests it is a very cruel area, which would be hard to explore. If you are going to use quotations from the extract in your answer, remember to set them out properly. Here are some points to remember: Quote accurately. Quotes of three words or less can be used in the sentence you're writing - for example ...when the writer talks about the ""futility of life"" he means... Longer quotations need to be included on a line of their own and with a space before it (known as an indent) - for example ...the writer describes the landscape as a ""desolation, lifeless, without movement, so lone and cold"" he creates a picture that... Short, well-chosen quotations are better than long, vague ones. Also remember that certain words and phrases are especially helpful when you're explaining an idea in detail. They can be particularly helpful if you are commenting on implicit meaning. The following wordbank shows you some of those phrases, and you might be able to add some more: Some other words and phrases that may be useful are those that help move your argument on. These are called connectives. Here are some examples:"	5
"Ray, the main character in this extract, has stolen a motorbike and caused an accident that killed someone. He has told nobody, but knows that he can't hide for much longer. He is about to get on a bus, but realises that the one person who can link him to the crime is the conductor of that very bus. Before he can run off, he bumps into Mrs Fitzroy, his best friend's mum. Answer the question below and then check your ideas against ours. Write one paragraph for each bullet point. He hung back, groping wildly for some excuse to prevent him getting on, but the bell rang and the engine increased its impatient rumble and his legs carried him upwards on to the platform, and he felt Mrs Fitzroy clamber on behind. The bus began to move. He turned towards the stairs, but she caught hold of his arm. ""This'll do,"" she said, and he turned back and sat beside her - the less fuss he made, the less obvious he was, the better. As he settled, he kept his face bent low, aware of the conductor walking towards them. He brushed past, and, noticing things with a total clarity, Ray saw the dark blue uniform that he was wearing and noted the heaviness and thickness of the material. He heard him clumping up the stairs, and he wondered, absurdly, if he was wearing heavy boots, too. Mrs Fitzroy was opening the bag which she had on her lap, and Ray felt in his pocket for his fare. If he had the right change, he could just hand it to the conductor without looking up. Yes, he had a ten and two pence piece. He glanced at Mrs Fitzroy and saw to his dismay that she was taking out a pound-note from her purse. That would mean a delay while she got her change - plenty of chance for him to be recognised. Could he offer to pay her fare? It would seem strange, but anything was better than being seen. What kind of atmosphere does the writer create in this extract and how do they do it? You should refer to: In this text, the writer creates an atmosphere of fear and tension. Ray's thoughts and actions at the start of the passage show that he is under a lot of pressure. He tries to think of an excuse to 'prevent him getting on' the bus, but knows that this will just make Mrs Fitzroy suspicious. When he tries to go upstairs, she insists they stay downstairs. Nothing seems to be going his way, and this leads us to believe he may well be spotted by the conductor. As the conductor approaches, Ray's fears increase which creates more tension. He keeps his face 'bent low' to avoid being recognised, and also notices things 'with a total clarity'. This shows that he is very scared and alert, ready for something to go wrong. When he realises Mrs Fitzroy has no change, he feels 'dismay'. The reader is kept on the edge of their seat waiting for the conductor to come along. The writer uses language, as well as events, to create tension. The phrase 'groping wildly for some excuse' shows Ray's panic and gives the impression that he feels he has no control over events. The way he notices the 'heaviness' of the conductor's uniform, and wonders if he was 'wearing heavy boots as well' might mean that he is afraid of the man. Ray asks himself 'Could he offer to pay her fare?'. This shows he is tense; he is running through possibilities in his mind. The writer uses Ray's fears to create an atmosphere of tension for the reader."	5
What can you understand about characters? See how they effect texts.	5
If you are analysing a character, you should look at what the writer tells you outright and what you can read between the lines. This is known as explicit and implicit meaning. This Revision Bite covers: First, second and third person accounts	5
Something that is explicit is obvious, out in the open, plainly stated and up-front. Explicit meaning is the easiest to pick out from a piece of text. Sometimes a writer wants it to be obvious that a character is good or bad or cruel or generous or mean and so on. Take a look at this extract: Jim Wellings was not a man to be glanced at. But nor was he a man to be stared at. To say he was a big man is like calling Buckingham Palace a big house. He was a man who filled whatever space there was. He wasn't fat, though; just big. Even from this short extract, we can tell a lot about Jim.	5
"Now consider the following extract. Read through it carefully and note down three things you think it tells us about the main character. Once you've done this, compare your ideas against ours. Stanley didn't have many friends at home. He was overweight and the kids at his middle school often teased him about his size. Even his teachers sometimes made cruel comments without realising it. On his last day of school, his math teacher, Mrs Bell, taught ratios. As an example, she chose the heaviest kid in the class and the lightest kid in the class, and had them weigh themselves. Stanley weighed three times as much as the other boy. Mrs Bell wrote the ratio on the board, 3:1, unaware of how much embarrassment she had caused both of them. 'Holes' - Louis Sachar What does this extract show us about the main character? Stanley is another big male, but it is clear that the writer wants us to react differently to him than we did to Jim Wellings in the earlier extract. Stanley is a lonely boy, because he ""didn't have many friends at home"". He is bullied and teased, even by adults. The fact that the teacher causes him ""embarrassment"" by showing him up in front of the class proves that he feels uncomfortable about his weight."	5
"Something that is implicit is inferred - it is suggested, but not actually said. Implicit meaning can be a little harder to find than explicit meaning. Writers like to draw you into their text and get you involved. It's up to you to make your mind up about a character, just as it is when you meet someone in real life. The clues you need to make up your mind about a character are all in the text. Look for the following: What the character says. What the character does. What others say about them. How others react to them. Take another look at one of the extracts from 'Holes'. Stanley has just arrived at the prison camp. What can you tell about the character of Mr Sir, the man in the cowboy hat, from reading between the lines? Some important phrases have been put in bold to give you a few clues. A man was sitting with his feet up on a desk. He turned his head when Stanley and the guard entered, but otherwise didn't move. Even though he was inside, he wore sunglasses and a cowboy hat. He also held a can of cream soda, and the sight of it made Stanley even more aware of his own thirst. He waited while the bus guard gave the man some papers to sign. ""That's a lot of sunflower seeds,"" the bus guard said. Stanley noticed a burlap sack filled with sunflower seeds on the floor next to the desk. ""I quit smoking last month,"" said the man in the cowboy hat. He had a tattoo of a rattlesnake on his arm, and as he signed his name, the snake's rattle seemed to wiggle. ""I used to smoke a pack a day. Now I eat a sack of these every week."" 'Holes' - Louis Sachar On the surface, this extract doesn't tell us much about Mr Sir, but you've probably begun to form an opinion about him. If we read between the lines, we can tell that he likes to make an impression and wants to be seen to be in charge. He is sitting ""with his feet up on a desk"" and has made his appearance even more striking by wearing sunglasses and a cowboy hat indoors. Sometimes people who act like this can like power a bit too much, and can be bullies. Could Mr Sir be a bully? When we consider the can of cream soda, we can say that the fact that Mr Sir fails to offer either Stanley or the bus driver anything to drink after their nine-hour, cross-desert journey suggests that he is a selfish man. That he keeps his own drink in full view of Stanley and the bus driver further suggests that he is cruel and likes to see other people's discomfort. We learn that Mr Sir stopped smoking recently. We could then expect him to be bad- and short-tempered. The tattoo of a rattlesnake, a dangerous reptile that is supposed to have a bad temper, adds to this impression. The sunflower seeds are, we are led to believe, there to help him as an alternative to cigarettes, but we don't get the feeling of optimism that they'll be successful. So there we have it; Mr Sir is a bad-tempered, selfish bully!"	5
"A text can be written in the first, second or third person. This is all about who is telling the story. Here is a quick summary: First person means ""I"" or ""we"". The narrator of the account will be a character in the text and we will read about events from their point of view. We will also tend to relate to and sympathise with their feelings because of this. Second person means ""you"". It is very rare to find a story written in the second person (why not have a go at writing a piece to see how difficult it is). Parts of adverts or leaflets are addressed directly to you, however, which can be a very persuasive way of writing. Third person means ""he"", ""she"", ""it"" or ""they"". The narrator of the story will usually be the writer. The text may give many different characters' viewpoints. Some stories focus on one character, the hero or heroine, and we usually relate to and sympathise with them more than others. Take a look at these three extracts. Decide which ""person"" each one is written in and check your answers to see if you are correct. When you arrive at Oldcastle Cottage you'll receive a warm welcome. Your every need will be taken care of by your hosts. Is the extract above written in the first, second or third person? It is written in the second person. The writer is talking directly to you. Mr. Fogg's wardrobe was amply supplied and in the best taste. Each pair of trousers, coat, and vest bore a number, indicating the time of year and season at which they were in turn to be laid out for wearing; and the same system was applied to the master's shoes. 'Around the World in Eighty Days' - Jules Verne Is the extract above written in the first, second or third person? It is written in the third person. The writer is telling you about Mr Fogg's clothing and how it is arranged. I continued walking in this manner for some time, endeavouring by bodily exercise to ease the load that weighed upon my mind. I traversed (crossed) the streets without any clear conception of where I was or what I was doing. 'Frankenstein' - Mary Shelley Is the extract above written in the first, second or third person? It is written in the first person. The writer is telling the story as if they were a character in it."	5
As well as having lots of ideas, you need to explain them clearly. One really effective way of doing this is to use PEE . So if you're answering a question, state your point, back it up with a piece of evidence and then explain it. Try out the PEE method. Here's an extract from 'Holes' about Stanley and the prison work camp. Find two features of Stanley's character and explain how they are suggested. Write your answer down and then compare it to ours. Stanley and his parents had tried to pretend that he was just going away to camp for a while, just like rich kids do. When Stanley was younger he used to play with stuffed animals, and pretend the animals were at camp. Camp Fun and Games he called it. Sometimes he'd have them play soccer with a marble. Other times they'd run an obstacle course, or go bungee jumping off a table, tied to broken rubber bands. Now Stanley tried to pretend he was going to Camp Fun and Games. Maybe he'd make some friends, he thought. At least he'd get to swim in the lake. 'Holes' - Louis Sachar Check our ideas on the extract by clicking the button below. Point: Stanley is a lonely boy. He is willing to make the best of a bad situation. Evidence: The writer suggests that Stanley spent long periods, when younger, playing alone with stuffed toys. Stanley thinks that he will have the chance to make friends and 'at least he'd get to swim in the lake'. Explanation: The writer lists the sort of games Stanley played with his stuffed toys at 'Camp Fun and Games' in a way that suggests he was playing on his own - the toys became his friends. He is going to a boy's prison work camp, but, instead of thinking about the horrors he might face, he shows that he is hopeful and ready to make the best of things.	5
"When quoting from a text, remember to: Quote accurately. Quotes of three words or less can be used in the sentence you're writing - for example ...when the writer talks about the ""futility of life"" he means... Longer quotations need to be included on a line of their own and with a space before it (known as an indent). Short, well-chosen quotations are better than long, vague ones. Remember that certain words and phrases are helpful when you're explaining an idea in some detail, especially if you are commenting on implicit meaning. The following list shows some of those phrases. Some other words and phrases that may be useful are those that help move your argument on. These are called connectives. Here are some examples:"	5
The extract comes from a book called 'Face' by Benjamin Zephaniah. Natalie is a Year 9 student and lives in East London. She is out with her boyfriend and his friends. They have stopped to chat with some boys from school. Answer the question below and then check your ideas against ours. You can use the bullet points to help you. After a couple of minutes she realised that her every move was being watched by a group of three girls and she couldn't help noticing how tough they looked. All three were wearing dark blue baggy jeans. She was pretty sure they were Londoners born and bred but thought they could find a job working for the Jamaican tourist board, not simply because of their dark skin but also because of their clothing. One had a T-shirt saying 'I love Jamaica'. Another wore a T-shirt that was a Jamaican flag and the third just had a West Ham football shirt on, but she, like the others, was adorned with yellow, black and green bangles, badges and necklaces. Natalie thought they looked good, but dangerous. 'You from round here, den?' said the big girl wearing the Jamaican flag. 'Yeah.' 'What school yu go to, den?' 'Eastmorelands.' 'Yeah, I wanid to go there but they wouldn't let me, said I had ta go ta Lonsdale Park, said it was nearer. What ya doing here?' The other two girls continued to look her up and down. Natalie expected trouble and in her mind she cursed the boys for bringing her there and for the way they had got lost in their silly conversation about football and cars. 'I'm just hanging around with my boyfriend and his mates.' At this point the girl wearing the West Ham shirt reached into her back pocket. Natalie swallowed hard as the girl pulled out a couple of leaflets. After separating one from the other she handed one to Natalie. 'Dat's the place to be, check it out, good vibes, good music. Ya like rap?' Natalie wanted to kick herself. She had completely misread the situation. They weren't out for a fight, they wanted to find out if she liked clubbing. They wanted to find out if she was one of them, an Eastender. 'Yeah,' Natalie replied, feeling a sense of relief. 'Yeah, rap's cool...' She began to wonder if she sometimes looked threatening and if she herself had been misjudged in the past. For people to be friendly, did they have to have permanent smiles on their faces? How does the writer show Natalie's thoughts and feelings changing during the extract? You should refer to: Just before the girls speak to her, Natalie seems even more anxious. She is used to being out on the streets of London and feels she needs to 'put on a front' and look tough. She is afraid they may be laughing at her clothes or hair, which makes her seem insecure about herself. However, when the girls come up to speak to her she hides her nerves and answers their questions. The way she uses short answers like 'Yeah' suggests she does not want to give too much away about herself or get into a fight. When she realises the girls are actually being friendly and want to give her a flyer for a club, Natalie's feelings change completely. She is ashamed of being suspicious and feels like 'kicking herself'. She realises the girls are Eastenders just like her. The writer shows how this makes her think about her own image. She wonders if people think she looks threatening, too. At this point she comes across as an intelligent, thoughtful girl who wants to learn how to judge people fairly in the future.	5
Paragraphs are the building blocks of all texts. They divide texts into sections so it's easier to understand what's being said. This Revision Bite covers:	5
There are two main ways of setting out paragraphs, with a few small variations: The first example shows how new paragraphs can be started on the next available line, but with the first word beginning slightly to the right, or indented. Â Â Â Â Â Â Â We've just come back from a lovely holiday in Southsea. The weather was glorious and Albert has still got a deep, golden glow from the sunshine. It's a pity it can't be like that all year round. Â Â Â Â Â Â Â The hotel we stayed in was spotless. We felt like royalty because the bedsheets were changed twice, in the same week! I told Albert not to get too used to it as I wasn't going to carry that sort of thing on when we got home. We also got nice, clean fluffy towels every other day too. 'Holes' - Louis Sachar The second example shows how new paragraphs can be started by missing a line. In this type of example, indenting the first new word is not necessary. We've just come back from a lovely holiday in Southsea. The weather was glorious and Albert has still got a deep, golden glow from the sunshine. It's a pity it can't be like that all year round. The hotel we stayed in was spotless. We felt like royalty because the bedsheets were changed twice, in the same week! I told Albert not to get too used to it as I wasn't going to carry that sort of thing on when we got home. We also got nice, clean fluffy towels every other day too. 'Holes' - Louis Sachar	5
"There are two main reasons why paragraphs are used: To show a change of subject. To show a new speaker is talking. Without paragraphs, texts would be very confusing. Have a look at this extract from Louis Sachar's novel, 'Holes'. He waited while the bus guard gave the man some papers to sign. ""That's a lot of sunflower seeds,"" the bus guard said. Stanley noticed a burlap sack filled with sunflower seeds on the floor next to the desk. ""I quit smoking last month,"" said the man in the cowboy hat. He had a tattoo of a rattlesnake on his arm, and as he signed his name, the snake's rattle seemed to wiggle. ""I used to smoke a pack a day. Now I eat a sack of these every week."" 'Holes' - Louis Sachar Now look at it again. He waited while the bus guard gave the man some papers to sign. ""That's a lot of sunflower seeds,"" the bus guard said. Stanley noticed a burlap sack filled with sunflower seeds on the floor next to the desk. ""I quit smoking last month,"" said the man in the cowboy hat. He had a tattoo of a rattlesnake on his arm, and as he signed his name, the snake's rattle seemed to wiggle. ""I used to smoke a pack a day. Now I eat a sack of these every week."" 'Holes' - Louis Sachar As you can see, the second version is far easier, and far clearer, to read."	5
What can improve sentence structure? We explain what you need and when to use it.	5
The way sentences are used can be just as important as the language they contain. They can create a flowing, lyrical effect. They can build up tension and drama. They can put across anger or humour. They can make writing seem simple or complex. This Revision Bite covers:	5
A sentence is made up of words put together to do a certain job. Let's take a look at what those pieces are and how they fit together to make a sentence. First, we have words. Words are the smallest meaningful bits of sense. Each of these words does a different job. Barked is a verb - it tells us what happens in a sentence. Dog is a noun - it names things in a sentence. Big is an adjective - it gives us more detail about a noun. We put words together to make a phrase. A phrase is a short, single piece of information: We use phrases to make a clause. A clause is a larger word group that includes a little more information. It consists at least two phrases - one is a noun phrase known as the subject, and the other is the verb. In this clause, the noun phrase is the big dog and the verb is barked. This now takes us to the sentence. If we put a capital letter at the beginning of the clause we've used, and a full stop at the end, we have a sentence. The big dog barked. This is a simple sentence. A simple sentence consists of one clause that has a subject and a verb. A simple sentence puts across one simple idea. A complex sentence is used to put across more detailed ideas. A complex sentence contains one main clause that can make sense on its own, and one or more minor clauses that are linked to it. When I arrived the big dog barked. The main clause is the 'big dog barked' because it has a subject and a verb and makes sense by itself. The minor clause is 'When I arrived'. Although it is a clause with a subject and a verb, it doesn't make sense on its own, it needs a main clause. We can add more minor clauses to make a more complex sentence. When I arrived the big dog barked because it was lonely. We can even split the main clause with a minor clause and still have a complex sentence. When I arrived the big dog which was lonely barked.	5
Take a look at these sentences to see if you can spot the main clause and the minor clauses in each one. See how your answers compare to ours. The main clause is highlighted. Q1. Even though he drove with care he failed the test. Q2. I like cheese and onion sandwiches. Q3. During term time my school opens at 8.45 am. Q4. The loser of the race buys everybody else an ice cream. A1. Even though he drove with care he failed the test. A2. I like cheese and onion sandwiches. A3. During term time my school opens at 8.45 am. A4. The loser of the race buys everybody else an ice cream.	5
"So far, we have identified two types of sentence - simple and complex. The other main type of sentence that a writer may use is called a compound sentence. Compound sentences contain two or more pieces of information and the pieces are linked by connectives. Connectives are words such as: Here are three examples of compound sentences with the connectives written in bold: The boys walked down the road and their parents waved from the house. The dog came rushing in so the cat ran upstairs. My friend gave me a lift because it was raining. One advantage of compound sentences is that a writer can build more detail into their writing. However, one problem is that some writers can get carried away and write long rambling sentences: My mate came round and said, ""Do you want to go out?"" and I did so we went to the park and sat around for a bit and then these other girls came over who we knew from school so we started talking to them and then we felt hungry so we... Did you spot the problem? Remember, care needs to be taken with connectives. Two in a sentence is usually enough, and they don't need to be used in every sentence. Writers sometimes don't use full sentences. Fragments often help to emphasise a point, create drama or show surprise: She looked as carefully as she could, but found nothing. Absolutely nothing. Help! Please help! Imagine this. You're trapped. It's dark. It's cold. Repeating a word or phrase can emphasise a point, or make sure it's fully understood: His head was drooping as if it weighed a ton, but it was held up by a sharp band around his throat that was almost choking him. He tried to reach up and tear the band away, but there were sharp bands round his wrists as well. He tried to move his feet, but there were more cold, sharp bands around his ankles. 'Urn Burial' - Robert Westall Westall refers to the bands around Ralph's body four times. This isn't because he couldn't think of another phrase. He is emphasising how tightly Ralph is trapped to create a sense of fear and tension. He also allows us to build up a picture gradually, just like Ralph does as he is regaining consciousness. Bit by bit, both Ralph and the reader realise that every part of him is tied up - there is no chance of escape."	5
Punctuation marks are used to determine the structure and organisation of sentences. Here are some common punctuation marks you need to know:	5
How can different texts be laid out? See why structure matters.	5
The structure of a text is how it is put together. No text will make sense unless it is structured in a clear way. At the very least, it should have a beginning, a middle and an end. This Revision Bite covers:	5
The beginning should introduce the subject. The writer wants to catch the reader's attention and hint at what is to come. If the beginning is poor, the reader could lose interest quickly and stop reading. The middle section presents the main ideas, thoughts, actions and so on. These will often be presented in stages or with several twists and turns of argument. The ending generally sums up the piece of text, or makes a final point, or brings a conclusion to a story. It can add to your marks in a test if you show a plan of how you are going to answer a long question. A writer will usually plan not only what they are going to write, but also how they are going to write it. For example, how would a writer plan a magazine article about the benefits of health and fitness? Imagine you are writing a plan for a magazine article about fitness and health. Beginning: do people need to be fit? Ending: get fit and eat healthy food and you will benefit This is an example of quite a straightforward plan. Each box contains a summary of a paragraph and they are organised in a way that steers the reader through a journey. Obviously, the more complex the issue, argument, story, and so on, the more complex the plan will be.	5
The beginning of a text is crucial to its success. If the start is weak, there is a risk that the reader will lose interest and stop reading it. Here is the opening paragraph of a text about boxing: Boxing - sport or spectacle? Boxing, amongst other hand-to-hand fighting, has been with us for thousands of years. Originally it was nothing more than bare fist fighting between two willing, and sometimes unwilling, competitors for the entertainment of others. Some people argue that it is a relatively safe, disciplined, highly skilled and technical sport that brings enjoyment and employment to a great many people. Others claim that it is a dangerous and barbaric spectacle that has no place in the civilised world. This article will explore each side's claim in more detail. Why is this an effective opening for the text? It is totally in keeping with the title. It uses a formal, impersonal tone, which is appropriate for an argument text. It gives a summary of both sides of the argument. Let's consider some alternative beginnings and see if they are suitable. Decide what you think of each one and then read our comments below. Boxing - sport or spectacle? This article will talk about the damage that can be inflicted when two men stand face-to-face with the sole intention of knocking each other out with their fists. It will go on to argue that boxing, or legitimate assault, has no place in the twenty first century. This extract certainly gets straight to the point. Although this beginning is quite formal, it is certainly not impersonal as the writer lets the reader know exactly what they think about boxing. The reader can be sure about what the answer to the question in the title will be from the first sentence. Boxing - sport or spectacle? The bell goes and the two warriors approach each other. They are quick. They are strong. They are hard. They are ready to hurt and be hurt. A left fist launches and connects with a nose. The crowd are on their feet. Cheering. Wanting more. Wanting blood. This is prose rather than a non-fictional argument. It uses descriptive and figurative language. It could be the opening of a short story or a novel.	5
"How a text ends is just as important as how it begins. Good endings should leave the reader feeling satisfied. Take a look at the final paragraph of the article about boxing. In conclusion, both sides of the debate have solid foundations. As has been shown, the arguments for and against have been put forward since boxing began. And, it would seem, the argument will continue for at least the foreseeable future, as compromise seems unlikely. Both sides do agree, however, that the debate is better held whilst boxing is licensed and controlled rather than unlicensed and uncontrolled. The latter would make it, in my opinion, neither sport nor spectacle. As you can see, the writer clearly signals that the end is approaching by using the connecting phrase ""In conclusion"". It maintains the impersonal approach it set out with by stating that the argument will continue and that ""compromise seems unlikely"". The last sentence is a statement of the writer's own opinion, but this doesn't alter the fact that it is, or has been, a discursive text. So, when answering how effective the beginning or ending of a text is, here's a quick checklist you might find helpful: Is it relevant? Does the tone suit the subject? Does it use language in the same way as the rest of the text? Is it satisfying? Do you really feel that the text is complete? Is it relevant? Does it suit the tone of the whole extract? Does it use language in the same way?"	5
"Certain texts, especially non-fiction, will be laid out in ways that capture interest and attention, to make information clear, or to help you find what you want to read. You will not be asked to write in detail about how a text is laid out until GCSE, but your teacher may ask you a short question on layout. Scan over the following text and note down at least four things the writer has done to make it look more interesting and easy to read. Position: St James' Park, King's Lynn, Norfolk. Map Ref: TF 625 198. Access: Red Mount Chapel is on a mound on ""The Walks"" in the park. Red Mount Chapel is a superb example of the Gothic style in architecture and even boasts its own musical ghost! Built in 1485 at the time of Henry VII, the first Tudor king, it was a stopping-off place for pilgrims on their way to Walsingham via the port of King's Lynn. Octagonal in shape, it is very small, and had three floors. The top floor is a chapel with fan tracery much like that in Cambridge's King's College. Underneath the chapel building there is reputed to be a long tunnel (not unusual), running to Castle Rising - a distance of 18km/12 miles (very unusual). An unfortunate, drunken fiddler once decided to explore the dark passageway with his instrument, his dog and his pint! He never reached the end of the tunnel, wherever it went, but his spirit remains and can be heard on occasions playing his tunes and singing, accompanied by the whining of his poor dog! The Shattered Maid's Heart (King's Lynn) Killed by a Pinprick (Stow Bartolph) Detached Church Tower (West Walton) Did you spot them? The large, bold writing of the heading and unusual font catches our attention. Bold writing is used for the subheadings, which list the location details. These details are separated from the rest of the text so they are easy to follow. The most interesting fact, about the haunting, is mentioned first, and kept in a short paragraph of its own. An image of the haunted tunnel is used to draw the reader's attention. Another bold subheading is used to draw attention to ""Places of Interest in the Neighbourhood"". These places are listed, using bullet points to make them clear."	5
When answering questions, you need to make sure that you explain your ideas clearly. One really effective way of doing this is to use the PEE technique. PEE stands for: Point - the idea you want to put forward. Evidence - to support your idea, such as a quotation from the text. Explanation - why you consider this to be an important part of your answer.	5
What can help you summarise? Skimming, scanning and topic sentences.	5
To summarise a text, you have to sum it up in as few words as possible. This Revision Bite covers:	5
Here are some tips on how to find information from a text: Read the text very carefully, at least once. If you are asked a question on a text, read the question a couple of times to make sure you know exactly what it asks. Skim over the text to get a general idea of it. Scan the text for key words and phrases.	5
If you are asked to summarise a text, you will need to identify what the text is about and write this in as few words as possible. Summing up a piece of text in a few words can actually be quite difficult, but it is a useful skill.	5
Want to know the differences between fiction and non-fiction? Have a look here.	5
Everything we read is either fiction or non-fiction. Fiction comes from the imagination. Non-fiction is based on fact. This Revision Bite covers: Non-fiction	5
Fiction does the following: It aims to entertain the reader. It often tells a story, even if it is a partially true one like a historical novel. It uses descriptive words, including adverbs and adjectives. It uses images or 'word pictures' that help us to imagine what is being described.	5
"Fiction texts can be divided into three main types: Fiction texts are written mainly to entertain the reader - they usually tell a story, but they can often be thought-provoking. Some may help you to make sense of, or understand, life better; some are a way for the writer to give their views and opinions of the world. Have a look at this extract: It seemed like just another cold, wet, winter night in downtown Pelleville. He hiked up his collar, stepped nearer the kerb and hailed a cab. ""Where to, mister?"" asked the driver. ""The Vegas"", was all he replied before the cab sped away. In the dry warmth, Spickler slipped his hand inside his coat and felt for the pistol. He knew it was there. He knew he'd be okay. You can probably tell that this extract is from a story. Here are the clues to look for: There is a character. The story is usually told in the first or third person. Descriptive and figurative language is used. Sentences are varied to keep it interesting. Take a look at this extract: If I could have just one more chance For us to sing, for us to dance. I'd like to make you feel the same Instead of thinking it's a game. Here are some clues, which will help you recognise poetry: It can be about characters, places, events, emotions, or beliefs. Descriptive and figurative language is often used. Many layers of meaning can be packed into just a few words. Rhyme and rhythm can be used. Here's an extract from a modern play: And you're telling us that nobody can vouch for you being at home on that evening... I told you, I wasn't feeling too clever and I just wanted to get some kip. Do you let people know when you're getting some kip, hey? Be serious... (standing) Interview paused at 8.17pm. Right, let's get this sorted. Det. Johnson and Const. Talbot leave. Here's how to recognise that you are reading a play: It will be written as a script to be performed by actors. Characters' names are listed next to the lines they should speak. It will include stage directions to tell the actors what to do and how to speak. The language can be natural and realistic and sometimes poetic. Sections are usually divided into acts, which may be divided into scenes."	5
Non-fiction texts can be divided into six main types: Information texts do just what their name suggests - they inform you. Here's an extract from an information text: The Bellaritz Hotel is situated on a beautiful, peaceful country estate, just ten minutes drive from the busy social and shopping opportunities of Belltown. This is how to recognise an information text: It provides clear information about a subject. It is usually written in the present tense. It is normally written in the third person. It organises and links information clearly, often using subheadings, short paragraphs, diagrams, photographs, maps, etc. Recount texts are about things that have happened. To recount something means to tell the story of it. So, a biography is a recount text because it tells the story of someone's life. Here's an extract from a recount text: My favourite shop was Mrs Deakin's, the newsagent and sweet shop. I'd skip there every Saturday morning with the threepenny bit that dad gave me. Here are some ways to recognise a recount text: It is written about something that happened. It may use a descriptive, story-like style although it is factual. It is written in the past tense.	5
"Instruction texts are all around us and are extremely useful. They include recipes, directions, manuals and plans. This is an extract from an instruction text: First, place the sugar and butter in a mixing bowl. Use a wooden spoon or electric mixer to beat them together until the mixture is smooth and light. Add the eggs and carefully beat them into the sugar and butter mixture... Here are some clues to help you recognise an instruction text: It instructs the reader, giving clear guidance about how to do something. It will be ordered. It can use bullet points, pictures and diagrams, to make the information clear. It will use imperative verbs (bossy verbs), which tell you what to do - for example ""make"",""add"" and ""stick! "". Explanation texts have a lot in common with information texts. They explain things in more detail. Many textbooks and reference books are explanation texts. Here is an example of explanation text: Choose which option you want and press the corresponding button. You will then be presented with a further list of options. These will enable you to configure your computer's memory in the most efficient way. You can usually recognise an explanation text because: It explains a subject and helps you to understand it more. It uses the present tense. It's impersonal. It may use diagrams, pictures, maps and photographs."	5
"Persuasive texts try to persuade you to do something - like buy something or give money to charity. Magazine articles and newspaper reports may try to persuade you to agree with them. Here's an example of persuasive text: Dear friend, Are you tired of the daily grind? Sick of working all hours of the day for little reward? Tired of never having enough money to really enjoy yourself? Well, now there's a way out... Here's how to spot this type of text: It tries to convince you to do or agree with something. It contains a mix of fact and opinion. It may use repetition, ""soundbites"" and persuasive or emotive language. It often seems to speak directly to the reader. Argument texts should be balanced and fair, and give all sides of an argument before coming to a conclusion. Here's an extract from an argument text: Foxhunting is a subject that provokes very strong feelings. Many people believe that it is cruel to hunt a fox with dogs, and totally agree with its ban. Many farmers, and even conservationists, however, have always argued that the fox is a pest, which attacks livestock and must be controlled. Here are some clues to help you identify an argument text: It discusses an issue, considering all points of view. It often uses a formal and impersonal style to seem balanced. It uses connectives to connect points, for example ""however"", ""but"", ""similarly"""	5
"Read the text below and decide what its purpose and audience is. Then identify at least two ways in which the writer has matched the style and content to the audience. Note your answers on a piece of paper before checking to see how you've done. The world you live in is full of energy: light, heat, electricity and sounds are some of the forms that energy takes. Most energy comes from the Sun, which provides heat and light for plants to grow, to keep you warm and let you see. 'The Usborne Book of Science' This text was written for young children (audience) to provide information (purpose) about energy. The writer has matched the text to the audience and purpose by: Using simple sentences. Using words that most young children will be able to read and understand. Addressing the reader directly by using the word ""you""."	5
There are two main types of language: literal and figurative. Literal language is explicit, obvious, out in the open and plainly stated. It is a major part of non-fiction texts, but can also be found in fiction. Figurative language infers or suggests things rather than stating them. Figurative language can give a text more richness and depth. It is often found in fiction texts and autobiographies, but can also be found in non-fiction.	5
Care to analyse? Work out how to understand different types of texts.	5
The writer of a text has to find ways of manipulating the reader - to grab their attention and hold it throughout. When answering Reading questions, you have to be able to work out how they do this and spot what tricks they use to manipulate their audience and keep them reading. This Revision Bite covers:	5
"Some persuasive texts aim simply at persuading us to do something, particularly charity leaflets, holiday brochures and adverts. Others may try in more subtle ways; newspaper and magazine articles may try to persuade us to agree with a certain view. Remember, a persuasive text will: Try to convince us to do or agree with something, such as spending money or agreeing with a certain belief. Contain a mixture of fact and opinion. Emphasise key points by using subheadings, repetition, memorable phrases and emotive language. Often use a personal style so that the text seems to speak directly to the reader. Show clear links between points, such as ""if you donate Â£20 you will be helping a sick animal"" or ""using our deodorant will attract women"". Stories can also be persuasive as well. A writer may want you to like or dislike a character. The way that they describe a character can persuade you to do either of these. Look at this extract from 'Jane Eyre': John Reed was a schoolboy of fourteen years old; four years older than I, for I was but ten; large and stout for his age, with a dingy and unwholesome skin; thick lineaments in a spacious visage, heavy limbs and large extremities. He gorged himself habitually at the table, which made him bilious, and gave him a dim and bleared eye with flabby cheeks. He ought now to have been at school; but his mamma had taken him home for a month or two, 'on account of his delicate health'. How does Charlotte BrontÃ« try to persuade, or convince, us that John Reed is an unpleasant character in this paragraph? She makes him sound unattractive, with his ""dingy and unwholesome skin"" and ""heavy limbs"". She suggests that he is greedy as he ""gorged himself habitually at the table"". She suggests that this is why he is so unhealthy, so that we don't feel sorry for him. She makes him sound spoilt because his mother is keeping him home from school, even though his so-called ""delicate health"" is his own fault."	5
"The extract below is from a leaflet about passive smoking. Q. What is passive smoking? A. Passive smoking is breathing in other people's tobacco smoke. Other people's tobacco smoke is sometimes called environmental tobacco smoke. Q. Why should I be worried? A. Only 15% of the smoke from a cigarette is inhaled by the smoker - the rest goes into the surrounding air and other people can breathe it in. Breathing air which contains tobacco smoke can be bad for your health. This is because the tiny particles and gases in tobacco smoke contain over 4000 chemicals, many of which are harmful - at least 60 are known to cause cancer. The gases also contain carbon monoxide, the poisonous gas that comes out of car exhausts. Q. What is the effect on my health? A. Breathing other people's smoke is uncomfortable and can cause: nose, throat and chest irritation and breathing difficulties The following questions will draw on all the skills you have revised so far. Note down your answers then compare them with ours. Q1. What, according to the leaflet, is ""passive smoking""? Q2. How much of the smoke from one cigarette is inhaled by the smoker? Q3. Name one effect that passive smoking can have on our health, according to the extract. Q4. Who do you think is the target audience for the leaflet? Q5. Give one reason why you think this. Q6. Look at the second answer that the writer has given in the leaflet: the one beginning ""Only 15% of the smoke..."". Explain two ways in which the writer has used language to persuade the reader that passive smoking is dangerous. Q7. Why has the writer phrased each heading as a question? Q8. Explain two ways in which the writer has used layout to make the text more effective. A1. Passive smoking is 'breathing in other people's tobacco smoke'. A2. 15% is inhaled by the smoker. A3. Coughing. (You could name any of the effects listed in the bullet points.) A4. The target audience could be teenagers, or a broad audience. It is the reason that you give in the next answer that is more important. A5. Reasons are: the language used is quite simple; sentences are mainly quite short and simple, many only contain one or two ideas; the information is broken up into short sections; the headings make the information easy to follow. All these would make the text accessible for many readers, including young people. A6. There are three main ways: the simple statement that it is 'bad for your health'; the fact that tobacco smoke contains 'over 4000 chemicals', many of which are harmful; the mention of carbon monoxide which is 'poisonous'. A7. The headings are phrased as questions to draw the reader into the text. A8. Layout has been used in several different ways: the 'Q' and 'A' format is eyecatching; the short paragraphs are easy to follow; the bullet points at the end of the extract make the facts easy to read."	5
You will now be very familiar with the idea that every text is intended to affect its readers in some way. Every reader is, of course, different too, and sometimes a text will affect you in ways a writer didn't imagine, or you might notice depth in it that others won't. This is particularly true if the text matches your personal experience. A story about your home town might interest you more than one about somewhere else, or a text about smoking might affect you more if you know somebody who is trying to give it up. Remember, you get marks for noticing the intended effect on the reader. Even if something doesn't interest, horrify, amuse or persuade you, you need to spot what the writer meant to do. It's usually better not to mention your personal opinion unless you are asked to.	5
"The extract below is about zombies. Note down your answers to the questions that follow and then check them against ours. ""The eyes were the worst. It was not my imagination. They were in truth like the eyes of a dead man, not blind, but staring, unfocused, unseeing. The whole face, for that matter, was bad enough. It was vacant, as if there was nothing behind it. It seemed not only expressionless, but incapable of expression. I had seen so much previously in Haiti that was outside the ordinary normal experience that for the flash of a second I had a sickening, almost panicky lapse in which I thought, or rather felt, ""Great God, maybe this stuff really is true..."". This is how William Seabrook described his encounter with one of the most horrifying creatures ever to step from the realms of the supernatural. For Seabrook was face-to-face with a zombie - a walking corpse. And in that moment he was prepared to believe all that he had heard about zombies since he first arrived on the island of Haiti. The zombie's fate is even worse than that of a vampire or werewolf. The vampire returns to his loved ones. He may be recognised and laid to rest. The werewolf may be wounded and regain human form. But the zombie is a mindless automaton (robot), doomed to live out a twilight existence of brutish toil (animal-like labour). A zombie can eat, move, hear, even speak, but he has no memory of his past or knowledge of his present condition. He may pass by his own home or gaze into the eyes of his loved ones without a glimmer of recognition. Neither ghost nor person, the zombie is said to be trapped, possibly forever, in that ""misty zone that divides life from death"". For while the vampire is the living dead, the zombie is merely the walking dead - a body without soul or mind raised from the grave and given a semblance (appearance) of life through sorcery. He is the creature of the sorcerer, who uses him as a slave or hires him out - usually to walk on the land. From 'The Book of Great Mysteries' edited by Colin Wilson and Christopher Evans. Q1. The writer chooses to begin the extract with a story based on someone's actual experience. Why do you think he did this? Q2. What is the effect of the two short sentences which open the extract? Q3. In the third sentence, why does the speaker use a list of three adjectives to describe the zombie's eyes? Q4. Why did Seabrook believe for a moment that he had met a real zombie? Q5. Which words tell you he did not really believe this? Q6. In the second paragraph, how does the writer use language to convince us that the zombie is a terrifying creature? Q7. Which other creatures are compared to the zombie in the third paragraph? Q8. Give two reasons why the zombie's fate is described as ""even worse"". Q9. What is the purpose of this text? A1. They did this to make the whole text sound more believable, and to add lively detail to the factual section which follows it. A2. They create drama and tension. A3. They help the reader to build up a picture of the zombie, making the writing more dramatic. A4. He had seen 'so much previously in Haiti that was outside normal experience' that he thought it might be a real zombie. A5. The words which tell us he didn't really believe this are: 'for a flash of a second', 'panicky lapse' and 'maybe'. A6. The writer uses the phrase 'one of the most horrifying creatures ever to step from the realms of the supernatural'. You might also have picked out the phrase 'walking corpse'. A7. Zombies are compared to vampires and werewolves. A8. The zombie's fate is worse because it can't think, it can't return to human form, it is doomed to slave labour and it has no memory of its home or loved ones. A9. The text has two purposes: firstly, to inform us about zombies, and secondly, to entertain."	5

In this extract, Benvolio goes to find out what is wrong with Romeo. Romeo tells him that he loves a girl called Rosaline but she doesn't love him back. Benvolio tells him to look at other attractive girls. Romeo says that no other girl could ever live up to Rosaline. This Revision Bite covers:	5
All exit, except MONTAGUE, LADY MONTAGUE, and BENVOLIO. Who set this ancient quarrel new abroach? Speak, nephew. Were you by when it began? I drew to part them. In the instant came The fiery Tybalt, with his sword prepared, Which, as he breathed defiance to my ears, He swung about his head and cut the winds, Who, nothing hurt withal, hissed him in scorn. While we were interchanging thrusts and blows, Came more and more, and fought on part and part, Till the Prince came, who parted either part. O where is Romeo? Saw you him today? Right glad I am he was not at this fray. Madam, an hour before the worshipped sun Peered forth the golden window of the east, Where, underneath the grove of sycamore That westward rooteth from this city side, So early walking did I see your son. Towards him I made, but he was ware of me, And stole into the covert of the wood. I, measuring his affections by my own, Which then most sought where most might not be found, Being one too many by my weary self, Pursued my humour not pursuing his, And gladly shunned who gladly fled from me. Many a morning hath he there been seen, With tears augmenting the fresh morningâ€™s dew, Adding to clouds more clouds with his deep sighs. But all so soon as the all-cheering sun The shady curtains from Auroraâ€™s bed, Away from light steals home my heavy son, And private in his chamber pens himself, Shuts up his windows, locks fair daylight out, And makes himself an artificial night. Black and portentous must this humour prove, Unless good counsel may the cause remove. My noble uncle, do you know the cause? I neither know it, nor can learn of him. Have you importuned him by any means? Both by myself and many other friends: But he, his own affectionsâ€™ counsellor, But to himself so secret and so close, Ere he can spread his sweet leaves to the air, Or dedicate his beauty to the sun. Could we but learn from whence his sorrows grow, We would as willingly give cure as know. See where he comes. So please you, step aside. Iâ€™ll know his grievance or be much denied. Exit MONTAGUE, with LADY MONTAGUE. Good morrow, cousin. Is the day so young? Ay me, sad hours seem long. Was that my father that went hence so fast? It was. What sadness lengthens Romeoâ€™s hours? Not having that which, having, makes them short. Of love? Out of her favour where I am in love. Alas, that Love, so gentle in his view, Should be so tyrannous and rough in proof! Alas, that Love, whose view is muffled still, Should without eyes see pathways to his will! Where shall we dine? O me! What fray was here? Yet tell me not, for I have heard it all. Hereâ€™s much to do with hate, but more with love. Why then, O brawling love, O loving hate, O anything of nothing first create! Misshapen chaos of well-seeming forms! Feather of lead, bright smoke, cold fire, sick health, Still-waking sleep, that is not what it is! This love feel I, that feel no love in this. Dost thou not laugh? No, coz, I rather weep. Good heart, at what? Why, such is loveâ€™s transgression. Griefs of mine own lie heavy in my breast, With more of thine. This love that thou hast shown Doth add more grief to too much of mine own. Love is a smoke made with the fume of sighs: Being vexed, a sea nourished with loving tears. What is it else? A madness most discreet, A choking gall, and a preserving sweet. Soft, I will go along â€“ And if you leave me so, you do me wrong. Tut, I have lost myself. I am not here. This is not Romeo: heâ€™s some other where. Tell me in sadness, who is that you love? What, shall I groan and tell thee? Groan? Why no â€“ But sadly tell me who. A word ill urged to one that is so ill. I aimed so near when I supposed you loved. A right good mark-man! And sheâ€™s fair I love. A right fair mark, fair coz, is soonest hit. Well, in that hit you miss. Sheâ€™ll not be hit And in strong proof of chastity well-armed, From Loveâ€™s weak childish bow she lives uncharmed. She will not stay the siege of loving terms, Nor bide thâ€™ encounter of assailing eyes, Nor ope her lap to saint-seducing gold. O, she is rich in beauty â€“ only poor That when she dies, with beauty dies her store. Then she hath sworn that she will still live chaste? She hath, and in that sparing makes huge waste, For beauty, starved with her severity, Cuts beauty off from all posterity. She is too fair, too wise, wisely too fair, To merit bliss by making me despair. She hath forsworn to love, and in that vow Do I live dead, that live to tell it now. Be ruled by me: forget to think of her. O, teach me how I should forget to think! By giving liberty unto thine eyes: Examine other beauties. These happy masks that kiss fair ladiesâ€™ brows, Being black, puts us in mind they hide the fair. The precious treasure of his eyesight lost. Show me a mistress that is passing fair: What doth her beauty serve, but as a note Where I may read who passed that passing fair? Farewell. Thou canst not teach me to forget. Iâ€™ll pay that doctrine, or else die in debt.	5

"In this section you will see buttons at the end of some paragraphs. These will give you extra information. If you want this information, just mouse over the buttons as you read through. The Montagues and Capulets have just had a fight in a public place in Verona. Prince Escalus stopped it and warned that if it happens again, those involved will be punished by death. The first set scene begins with Montague asking Benvolio how the fight began. ""I drew to part them"" C C : Benvolio is the peacemaker of the play. He tried to stop the servants from fighting. However, he did it by taking out his sword. Benvolio tells him that servants from both families were fighting and that when he tried to stop them, Tybalt turned on him. I I : - Love and Hate - You might agree with Benvolio's opinion that Tybalt is 'fiery', but Benvolio's description of Tybalt's behaviour is full of hatred too. He is quick to place all of the blame on Tybalt. After that, lots of other people joined in until the Prince came and stopped the fighting. Lady Montague is worried about her son, Romeo. He wasn't involved in the fighting but she wonders where he is. Benvolio explains that he saw him skulking about before dawn. Montague says that this is not unusual behaviour for Romeo: people have seen him crying and sighing on his own before daybreak before. C C : The audience finds out a lot about Romeo before he even walks onto the stage. What are your first impressions of Romeo? Montague says he has tried to talk to his son, but he won't open up to him. I I : Parents and children - You might be able to sympathise with Romeo not wanting to talk about his feelings with his father. He says he is like a flower that never gets to open because it has been stopped from blossoming by a worm that has eaten into it. L L : This is a simile to show that no one can get near to Romeo whilst he is in such a bad mood. When Romeo arrives, Montague and Lady Montague leave Benvolio to try and find out why he is in such a bad mood all of the time. Ay me, sad hours seem long I I : - Time - There are lots of references to time in this play. The events in this play take place in just less than one week. Romeo and Juliet both feel that time drags whilst they are apart from one another. Romeo tries to explain that he is in love with a girl who doesn't love him back. He doesn't make himself very clear though and Benvolio has to work hard to get him to tell him about it. Romeo comes up with lots of confusing descriptions of love to try and explain how he feels. L L : The list of opposites in Romeo's speech ('loving hate', 'heavy lightness', etc) are called oxymorons. They give us an important clue to his character. His confusing speech shows us how confusing the world is to him as a young man. It also shows us that Romeo likes to play with language. ""Here's much to do with hate, but more with love"" I I : - Love and Hate - Romeo is commenting on the street brawl that has just happened: it's about hating an opposing family and feeling love and loyalty towards their own. Taken on its own, the line sums up the play as a whole: it's about two families that hate each other, but more about the love between Romeo and Juliet. Romeo speaks in rhyme to try to describe how he feels. L L : Romeo's speeches are often in rhyme. He also likes wordplay, metaphors and similes. Romeo loves to talk about love, but does he really know what love is at this point? You could say that Romeo, at this point is 'all talk and no action'. He says that love is like smoke made from the hot breath of lovers and that the flames are the sparks in their eyes. But if it doesn't work out, love is a sea of tears. He also describes love as a kind of madness and a poison. I I : - Love - The language that Romeo uses to describe love gives us an idea of what Romeo believes love to be at this point. For him it's about desire, which sounds like lust rather than true love. Benvolio brings Romeo back to earth with a straightforward question: who is the girl he is in love with? P P : Whilst Romeo is pouring his heart out, Benvolio's responses could be performed in a number of ways- sympathetic, impatient, humorous. All three work. Romeo still won't give him a straight answer though. L L : Romeo and Benvolio are good friends. We can see this through the way they banter with one another. He tells Benvolio that the girl is very beautiful but she doesn't want to fall in love. It seems that she is very pure and Romeo says that because she isn't interested in men, her beauty will be wasted! I I : - Love - We never meet Rosaline in the play and only have Romeo's description of her to go by. It's hard to tell whether she really is a very good girl or whether she simply doesn't fancy Romeo! Then she hath sworn that she will still live chaste? She hath, and in that sparing makes huge waste Benvolio says that the best thing to do is to forget her. He advises Romeo to look at other attractive girls. Romeo swears that he can never forget her; he'll never find anyone as beautiful as her. Benvolio bets that he will."	5
"There are four characters in this key extract, but we also learn about a character called Rosaline even though she never makes an appearance herself in the play. Rosaline does not appear in the play but we learn that she is: We also learn that Tybalt, Juliet's cousin is ""fiery"" and loves to fight the Montagues."	5
If you get a question about characters in the Key Extracts, here is how to use PEE (see page 2) to help with the middle part of your answer: Romeo is obviously a very sensitive young man. He seems to be exploring the idea of love. He may well long to be in love. Some of his ideas about love are confused and confusing. Romeo does not join in with the street brawl and is sad that the violence takes place. He says that he understands that the violence is more to do with love and loyalty towards family than it is to do with hatred. He has been unhappy for some time and his family is worried. When Romeo talks to Benvolio, he finds it difficult to make himself clear. He is more interested in using language cleverly. When he uses oxymorons like 'heavy lightness' it is as though he isn't really sure what love is. When he talks about Rosaline, he focuses on her beauty. He says he loves her, but he is annoyed by her virtuous personality. Romeo lives amongst people who will kill others and risk their own lives for the sake of their own family, so he knows about passion. The fact that he won't talk to his father about why he is unhappy isn't very loving. Romeo talks about love in an abstract way. He likes the idea of love, and he might have been influenced by what poets have said about love. It could be argued that if Romeo really loved Rosaline, then he would respect her wishes to remain a virgin. Towards the end of the extract, Romeo seems more interested in sex than true love.	5
If you are given a question about the language in this Key Extract, here is how to use PEE (see page 2) to help with the middle part of your answer: When talking about language, the things to concentrate on are: The example below is about the language of love. Take a look, then think about how you might answer a question on Romeo's descriptions of love. Love is an excellent subject for poets. Romeo enjoys using lots of different poetic devices to explore the idea of love. The idea of love seems to be making Romeo's brain ache. He comes up with a list of oxymorons (pairs of opposite words eg 'loving hate') to try and find the right definition of love. He makes up some vivid metaphors for love, but comes closer with his descriptions to lust. He thinks love is a kind of madness or even a poison. He thinks that he loves Rosaline. He compares her to a Roman goddess and complains that Cupid keeps missing her heart with his arrows. He focuses on her beauty and talks about his problems getting her to love him back as though it is a kind of battle. At this point in the play, Romeo doesn't seem to understand what true love is. It is possible that he has got some of his romantic ideas from stories. He likes talking about love, but some of his opinions don't sound very loving. We never meet Rosaline in the play, but you may think to yourself that she is wise not to encourage Romeo's advances. They don't sound respectful or honourable. In fact, it could be argued that Romeo's ideas about love are funny or silly, and show him up to be immature and shallow.	5
The whole play deals with lots of different ideas, but in the first key extract the main ones are: Most questions require answers that cover several aspects of the play (remember CLIP). For instance, if you are given a question about the role of Romeo, you need to talk about more than just the performance. You could write about:	5
When you write about performance, mention the tone or feeling you get at a particular point in the play, and the effect it might have on the audience. You can find evidence for your ideas in the four question areas: Language used - the detail about love, for example Issues and ideas - like time, love and hate Performance instructions, such as stage directions Once you understand how the audience should feel, you can decide how you might direct a particular scene. Remember, there are lots of different ways to perform the same scene. A good answer depends on how well you explain yourself. Here is an example of an answer to a question about performance. Think about how you might answer the same question. Benvolio's replies to Romeo could either show that he is a good listener who wants to understand his friend's problems, or that he is amused by what Romeo has to say because he knows that his friend is not serious about this girl. When Benvolio speaks to Montague, the mood is serious. When Romeo arrives, he has to ask lots of questions because Romeo is evasive. Some of Benvolio's comments could be said in a sarcastic or sympathetic way. The jokes that the two characters share show that they are good friends. Benvolio gives advice at the end of the scene that shows that he doesn't believe Romeo's love for Rosaline is serious. The way Benvolio behaves towards Romeo shapes the way the audience perceives Romeo. This is important because Romeo is the main character. The audience has to like him and worry about him for the tragedy to work. If the actor playing Benvolio speaks his lines in a patient and sympathetic way, it makes Romeo seem like a young man who finds the world confusing. If Benvolio's lines are spoken humorously, the comedy in Romeo's speeches will be brought to life. Once you understand the First Key Extract, you are ready to move on to the second.	5
In this extract, Romeo hides in the Capulets' garden and watches Juliet. Juliet talks to herself and declares she loves him. She is shocked when he replies. Though they have only met that evening, they know that they love each other. Juliet promises to send a messenger to him in the morning to find out where and when their wedding will be. This Revision Bite covers:	5
The garden, beside the Capulet house. ROMEO comes forward (reacting to MERCUTIOâ€™s joking). He jests at scars that never felt a wound. Enter JULIET, coming to her window-balcony above. ROMEO, below, sees the light at the window, then realises it is JULIET. It is the east, and Juliet is the sun. Arise, fair sun, and kill the envious moon, That thou her maid art far more fair than she. Be not her maid, since she is envious: Her vestal livery is but sick and green, And none but fools do wear it. Cast it off. â€“ It is my lady! â€“ O, it is my love! O that she knew she were! She speaks â€“ yet she says nothing. What of that? Two of the fairest stars in all the heaven, Having some business, do entreat her eyes To twinkle in their spheres till they return. What if her eyes were there, they in her head? As daylight doth a lamp. Her eyes in heaven That birds would sing and think it were not night! See how she leans her cheek upon her hand. O that I were a glove upon that hand, That I might touch that cheek! Ay me! (Aside) She speaks. As glorious to this night, being oâ€™er my head, Unto the white-upturnÃ¨d wondering eyes When he bestrides the lazy-pacing clouds, And sails upon the bosom of the air. O Romeo, Romeo! Wherefore art thou Romeo? Or if thou wilt not, be but sworn my love And Iâ€™ll no longer be a Capulet. (Aside)Shall I hear more, or shall I speak at this? â€˜Tis but thy name that is my enemy. Thou art thyself, though not a Montague. Nor arm, nor face, nor any other part Belonging to a man. O, be some other name! Whatâ€™s in a name? That which we call a rose By any other word would smell as sweet. So Romeo would, were he not Romeo called, Without that title. Romeo, doff thy name â€“ And for that name, which is no part of thee, Take all myself. I take thee at thy word. Call me but love, and Iâ€™ll be new-baptized. Henceforth, I never will be Romeo. What man art thou, that thus bescreened in night So stumblest on my counsel? I know not how to tell thee who I am. My name, dear saint, is hateful to myself Because it is an enemy to thee. Had I it written, I would tear the word. Of thy tongueâ€™s uttering, yet I know the sound. Art thou Romeo, and a Montague? Neither, fair maid, if either thee dislike. How camâ€™st thou hither, tell me, and wherefore? And the place death, considering who thou art, If any of my kinsmen find thee here. With loveâ€™s light wings did I oâ€™erperch these walls, And what love can do, that dares love attempt. Therefore thy kinsmen are no stop to me. If they do see thee, they will murder thee. Alack, there lies more peril in thine eye Than twenty of their swords. Look thou but sweet And I am proof against their enmity. I would not for the world they saw thee here. I have nightâ€™s cloak to hide me from their eyes. And but thou love me, let them find me here. Than death proroguÃ¨d, wanting of thy love. By whose direction foundâ€™st thou out this place? By love, that first did prompt me to inquire. He lent me counsel, and I lent him eyes. I am no pilot, yet wert thou as far As that vast shore washed with the farthest sea, I should adventure for such merchandise. Thou knowest the mask of night is on my face, For that which thou hast heard me speak tonight. Fain would I dwell on form â€“ fain, fain deny What I have spoke. â€“ But farewell compliment! Dost thou love me? I know thou wilt say â€˜Ayâ€™ â€“ And I will take thy word. Yet if thou swearâ€™st Thou mayst prove false. At loversâ€™ perjuries They say Jove laughs. O gentle Romeo, If thou dost love, pronounce it faithfully. Or if thou think I am too quickly won, Iâ€™ll frown, and be perverse, and say thee nay, So thou wilt woo â€“ but else, not for the world. And therefore thou mayst think my â€™haviour light. But trust me, gentleman, Iâ€™ll prove more true Than those that have more cunning to be strange. I should have been more strange, I must confess, But that thou overheardâ€™st, ere I was ware, My true-love passion. Therefore pardon me, And not impute this yielding to light love, Which the dark night hath so discoverÃ¨d. That tips with silver all these fruit-tree tops â€“ O swear not by the moon, thâ€™ inconstant moon, That monthly changes in her circled orb, Lest that thy love prove likewise variable. What shall I swear by? Do not swear at all. â€“ Or if thou wilt, swear by thy gracious self, Which is the god of my idolatry, And Iâ€™ll believe thee. I have no joy of this contract tonight. It is too rash, too unadvised, too sudden â€“ Too like the lightning, which doth cease to be This bud of love, by summerâ€™s ripening breath, May prove a beauteous flower when next we meet. Good night, good night! As sweet repose and rest Come to thy heart as that within my breast. O wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied? What satisfaction canst thou have tonight? Thâ€™ exchange of thy loveâ€™s faithful vow for mine. And yet I would it were to give again. Wouldâ€™st thou withdraw it? For what purpose, love? But to be frank and give it thee again: And yet I wish but for the thing I have. My bounty is as boundless as the sea, The more I have, for both are infinite. The NURSE is heard calling from inside the house. I hear some noise within. Dear love, adieu! Stay but a little: I will come again. She goes from the window. Being in night, all this but a dream, Too flattering-sweet to be substantial. JULIET returns above. Three words, dear Romeo, and good night indeed. If that thy bent of love be honourable, Thy purpose marriage, send me word tomorrow By one that Iâ€™ll procure to come to thee, And all my fortunes at thy foot Iâ€™ll lay, And follow thee, my lord, throughout the world. (From inside the house) Madam! I come! Anon! â€“ But if thou meanâ€™st not well, (Calling again) Madam! By and by! I come! â€“ To cease thy suit, and leave me to my grief. Tomorrow will I send. So thrive my soul, â€“ A thousand times good night! She goes again. A thousand times the worse, to want thy light! Love goes toward love as schoolboys from their books, But love from love, toward school with heavy looks.	5
"In this section you will see buttons at the end of some paragraphs. These will give you extra information. If you want this information, just mouse over the buttons as you read through. Romeo and his friends have left the Capulets' party. Romeo has run away from his friends. Mercutio has been shouting rude jokes because he thinks that Romeo has gone off with Rosaline. Mercutio and Benvolio finally give up looking for him and go home. The second set extract begins with Romeo hiding from Mercutio and Benvolio in Juliet's garden. Romeo thinks to himself that Mercutio can never understand how he feels because he has never been in love. ""He jests at scars that never felt a wound"" He watches Juliet as she stands on her balcony thinking out loud. He thinks that she is like the sun L L : Romeo uses lots of words and images that relate to light when he describes Juliet. : 'sun', 'stars' 'brightness'. and that the moon is jealous of her because she is so beautiful. He says that her eyes are like two stars that are so bright that they would stop night-time from being dark if they were in heaven, and the birds would sing because they would think that night was day. L L : Romeo uses more words and images to do with light to describe Juliet. He idolises her and compares her to an angel. L L : When Romeo says that Juliet is like an angel from heaven, on the one hand, he is saying how lovely she is. On the other hand, you could say that he doesn't really see her as a flesh and blood person. He idolises her. Do you believe that he can really love her when he doesn't actually know anything about her? Or do you believe in love at first sight? Juliet, not realising that Romeo is hiding in her garden, imagines what she would say to Romeo if he were there. She says out loud that she wishes he wasn't a Montague, but says that it doesn't really matter because she loves him anyway, and hopes that he loves her. After all, a name is just a word; it doesn't really mean that much. L L : If we used another word for a rose instead of the word 'rose', eg 'poo', the rose would still be a rose, it wouldn't smell like poo just because we used that word. In the same way, Romeo is still lovely even though his name is Montague. P P : When Juliet is thinking these things aloud on her balcony, she doesn't know that anyone else is watching. Have you ever practiced saying something to someone, even though you know that you would never be brave enough to say it? What's in a name? That which we call a rose By any other word would smell as sweet When Romeo replies, Juliet nearly jumps out of her skin. ""My name, dear saint, is hateful to myself"" L L : When Romeo calls her 'dear saint', Juliet realizes who he is. Romeo called her 'dear saint' at the party. Juliet is very worried for Romeo's safety; he is a Montague on Capulet property. Romeo uses very poetic and exaggerated language to describe how he managed to climb over the walls. L L : Romeo has been quite brave and perhaps foolish to break into Juliet's garden. He likes to takes risks and doesn't think clearly about the seriousness of his actions. He uses poetic language to exaggerate his bravery. He declares that he'd rather die than live never having the opportunity to love Juliet. Juliet admits that she is embarrassed that Romeo heard the things that she was saying about him. She asks him if he loves her too, but she doesn't give him the chance to answer. C C : Juliet is worried that she has shown herself to be too keen on Romeo. In Shakespeare's day, nice girls weren't supposed to show that they were interested in boys. P P : Juliet's speech is very long! Is she nervous or embarrassed? Is she a chatterbox? Is she so excited about her new love that she can't stop talking about it? Romeo begins to use poetic language about the moon to describe how much he loves her, but Juliet won't let him finish. C C : Time - Juliet won't let Romeo finish his sentences! Poor Romeo! We already know how much he loves to speak! Juliet's mind is working very quickly. She is excited, but also worried about how suddenly they have fallen in love. She says that if he swears by the moon, he might turn out to be just as changeable as the moon (the moon changes its shape throughout the month). She worries that they have fallen in love so quickly. It is too rash, too unadvised, too sudden. She tries to say goodnight, but she is excited and passionate about her feelings for Romeo and can't seem to stop talking about it. ""My bounty is as boundless as the sea. My love as deep. The more I give to thee, The more I have, for both are infinite"" C C : Juliet's use of imagery seems more heartfelt than Romeo's: her love is as deep as the sea, and the sea never runs out. That's passion! Juliet's Nurse shouts to her from inside the house. Juliet asks Romeo to wait. As she goes into her bedroom, Romeo thinks to himself that their love seems like a dream. I I : Love - Is this true love? How could it have happened so quickly? Do you believe in 'love at first sight'? Remember, that same evening that he met and fell in love with Juliet, Romeo was moping about saying that he would never love anyone as much as he loved Rosaline! Romeo might argue though that he didn't really know what true love was until he met Juliet. Juliet comes back out onto the balcony and tells Romeo that if he is serious about her, she will send a messenger out to him tomorrow to find out where and what time they will get married! I I : Time - events happen very quickly in this play. In less than a week, Romeo and Juliet fall in love, get married and die. She says goodnight to him as her Nurse impatiently tells her to come inside. Romeo finds it hard to say goodnight to her. C C : Romeo said that he was in love with Rosaline in the first extract. Less than a day later, he claims to be in love with Juliet. Has he really thought about the consequences of marrying Juliet. Perhaps, when you are in love, nothing else matters. What do you think?"	5
"In the First Key Extract, Romeo claimed to be in love with a girl called Rosaline. By the early hours of the very next morning, in the Second Key Extract, Romeo is exchanging ""love's faithful vows"" with Juliet. It could be said that when it comes to relationships, Romeo isn't very faithful. On the other hand, perhaps he has found his soul mate in Juliet."	5
Think about how language is used in the two Key Extracts - for example, where it seems the same in both, and where it seems different. If you get a question about language in the Key Extracts, here is how to use PEE to help you with your answer: Love is described in many different ways in the two extracts. By the second extract, love is described in a more positive light. In the first extract, Romeo uses oxymorons because he is confused about his feelings for Rosaline. Romeo compares love to poison and madness. In the second extract, Romeo uses words to do with light and heaven when describing his feelings for Juliet. Juliet talks about love in terms of truth and promises. In the first extract, love means many different things to Romeo. Love is confusing to Romeo and seems to have a dark side that he has no control over. Love is ruining his life. By the end of the first extract, you might think that Romeo has confused his feelings of lust for love. In the second extract, love is related to light and heaven for Romeo. Perhaps when he meets Juliet, he realizes what true love is. For Juliet, love is about truth and honesty. She is almost overwhelmed by her feelings for Romeo. For both characters, love is a powerful and wonderful force.	5
"The two extracts deal with some deep issues. You will need to discuss how these are brought out. Some of the 'big' themes are: Ay me, sad hours seem long. If the question asks you to comment on how the theme of time is explored, consider these points: Montague and Benvolio discuss the ""ancient quarrel"" and how it escalated so swiftly because of the quick tempers of servants from each opposing family along with Tybalt's ""fiery"" reaction. Time passes slowly for Romeo whilst he is in a bad mood. He hides himself away during the daytime. Romeo is impatient to have a physical relationship and does not want to wait for Rosaline. Romeo gets over Rosaline quickly and falls for Juliet suddenly. Juliet falls in love just as quickly with Romeo. Having spent one evening together they are planning their wedding for the next day."	5
There are a lot of different ways to perform a particular scene. How is the drama created in the two Key Extracts? From the table below, you will see there are elements of the two Key Extracts that are quite similar. But whereas there is some humour in the first extract, the second extract is more moving and romantic. This needs to be brought out in the performance. Once you understand how the audience should feel, you can decide how you might direct particular parts of the play. Answer the question you have, not the question you would like. Make a short plan. Use PEE.	5
In this extract, Ariel's song brings Ferdinand to Prospero's cave. Miranda sees Ferdinand and thinks he must be a spirit - while Ferdinand thinks Miranda is a goddess. They fall in love, but Prospero is not pleased, and makes Ferdinand his prisoner. This Revision Bite covers:	5
Re-enter ARIEL (invisible to all except PROSPERO), playing and singing. He leads FERDINAND. (Song) Come unto these yellow sands And then take hands: Curtsied when you have, and kissed, The wild waves whist. Foot it featly here and there, The burthen. Hark, hark! (Other spirit voices in the air) Bow-wow! The watch-dogs bark: (Other spirit voices) Bow-wow! Cry cock-a-diddle-dow: (Other spirit voices) Cock-a-diddle-dow! Where should this music be? I'the air or the earth? It sounds no more; and, sure, it waits upon Some god o'the island. Sitting on a bank, Weeping again the King my father's wreck, This music crept by me upon the waters, With its sweet air. Thence I have followed it â€“ Or it hath drawn me rather. But 'tis gone. No, it begins again. (Song) Full fathom five thy father lies â€“ Of his bones are coral made; Those are pearls that were his eyes. Nothing of him that doth fade, But doth suffer a sea-change Into something rich and strange. Sea-nymphs hourly ring his knell â€“ (Chorus of spirit voices) Ding dong â€“ Hark! Now I hear them â€“ (ARIEL and spirit voices) Ding dong bell. The ditty does remember my drowned father. This is no mortal business, nor no sound That the earth owes. I hear it now above me. (To MIRANDA) The fringÃ¨d curtains of thine eye advance, And say what thou see'st yond. What is't? A spirit? Lord, how it looks about! Believe me, sir, It carries a brave form. But 'tis a spirit. No, wench: it eats and sleeps and hath such senses As we have, such. This gallant which thou seeâ€™st Was in the wreck â€“ and, but heâ€™s something stained A goodly person. He hath lost his fellows, And strays about to find â€™em. A thing divine, for nothing natural I ever saw so noble. (Aside) It goes on, I see, Within two days for this. On whom these airs attend! Vouchsafe my prayer How I may bear me here. My prime request, Which I do last pronounce, is â€“ O, you wonder! â€“ If you be maid or no? No wonder, sir; But certainly a maid. My language! Heavens! I am the best of them that speak this speech, How, the best? What wert thou, if the King of Naples heard thee? A single thing, as I am now, that wonders To hear thee speak of Naples. He does hear me â€“ And that he does I weep. Myself am Naples, Who with mine eyes, neâ€™er since at ebb, beheld The King my father wrecked. Alack, for mercy! (Aside) The Duke of Milan And his more braver daughter could control thee, They have changed eyes. Delicate Ariel, Iâ€™ll set thee free for this. (To FERDINAND) A word, good sir. I fear you have done yourself some wrong. A word. Why speaks my father so ungently? This That eâ€™er I sighed for. Pity move my father To be inclined my way! (Aside) They are both in eitherâ€™s powers. But this swift business I must uneasy make, lest too light winning Make the prize light. (To FERDINAND) One word more: I charge thee That thou attend me. Thou dost here usurp Upon this island as a spy, to win it From me, the lord onâ€™t. No, as I am a man! Thereâ€™s nothing ill can dwell in such a temple. If the ill spirit have so fair a house, Good things will strive to dwell withâ€™t. (To FERDINAND) Follow me! (To MIRANDA) Speak not you for him; heâ€™s a traitor. (To FERDINAND) Come! Iâ€™ll manacle thy neck and feet together. Sea-water shalt thou drink: thy food shall be The fresh-brook mussels, withered roots, and husks Wherein the acorn cradled. Follow! No! Mine enemy has more power. He draws his sword but is prevented from moving by PROSPEROâ€™s magic power. O dear father! Make not too rash a trial of him, for Heâ€™s gentle, and not fearful. What! I say â€“ My foot my tutor? (To FERDINAND) Put thy sword up, traitor â€“ Is so possessed with guilt. Come from thy ward â€“ And make thy weapon drop. Beseech you, father! Hence! Hang not on my garments. Sir, have pity! Iâ€™ll be his surety. Silence! One word more Shall make me chide thee, if not hate thee. What! An advocate for an impostor! Hush! Thou thinkâ€™st there is no more such shapes as he, Having seen but him and Caliban. Foolish wench! To the most of men this is a Caliban, And they to him are angels. Are then most humble. I have no ambition To see a goodlier man. (To FERDINAND) Come on! Obey. Thy nerves are in their infancy again, And have no vigour in them. So they are. My spirits, as in a dream, are all bound up. My fatherâ€™s loss, the weakness which I feel, The wreck of all my friends, nor this manâ€™s threats, To whom I am subdued, are but light to me, Behold this maid. All corners else oâ€™the earth Let liberty make use of: space enough Have I in such a prison. (Aside) It works. (To FERDINAND) Come on. (To ARIEL) Thou hast done well, fine Ariel! (To FERDINAND) Follow me. (To ARIEL, whispering more instructions) Hark what thou else shalt do me. (To FERDINAND) Be of comfort. My fatherâ€™s of a better nature, sir, Than he appears by speech. This is unwonted Which now came from him. (To ARIEL) Thou shalt be as free As mountain winds. But then exactly do All points of my command. To the syllable. (To FERDINAND) Come, follow. (To MIRANDA) Speak not for him.	5
In this section you will see buttons at the end of some paragraphs. These will give you extra information. If you want this information, just mouse over the buttons as you read through. Before this scene, Prospero and his slave, Caliban have exchanged cross words. The First Key Extract begins with Ferdinand hearing Ariel's song. L L : Ariel's song calms the stormy waters. In 'The Tempest', music is linked closely to magic and illusion. He wonders where the sounds are coming from. I I : Illusion - Ferdinand does not know where the sound is coming from. He assumes that it is magic and tells us that the music not only calmed the storm, but also made him feel better. He follows the sound, and when the song begins again, it suggests to Ferdinand that his father has drowned. When Miranda sees Ferdinand approaching, she can't believe her eyes. She doesn't think that Ferdinand is real. I I : Illusion - Ferdinand is a living human being, but Miranda is convinced that he is a magical creature. In 'The Tempest', things are never quite as they at first seem. Prospero explains that he is a man, not a spirit and that he is looking for other survivors of the shipwreck. Prospero feels excited that Miranda and Ferdinand seem to like each other: it was his plan all along I I : Power - Prospero claims that he has used magic to make Miranda and Ferdinand fall in love. Prospero likes to control and manipulate people through his magic. , and he promises to reward Ariel with his freedom for helping to get them together. Ferdinand asks Miranda if she is an ordinary girl or a goddess. L L : Miranda can't believe that Ferdinand is an ordinary mortal. She thinks he's a 'spirit'. She calls him 'divine' and 'noble'. Ferdinand refers to her as a 'goddess'. The language they use suggests that they worship one another. He is shocked when she speaks his language. When he hints that he is the King of Naples, Prospero challenges him. C C : Prospero likes to be in control. As soon as Ferdinand suggests that he has any sort of power, Prospero tries to undermine him. Prospero's questions are sarcastic and mocking in his attempt to show Ferdinand who is boss. Ferdinand sadly explains that he believes that his father, the King of Naples, has drowned in the shipwreck along with the Duke of Milan and his son. Prospero watches Ferdinand and thinks to himself that he will be able to manipulate him easily now that Ferdinand is in love with his daughter. C C : Think carefully about what kind of man Prospero is. Is he a caring father who will do anything to get the best for his daughter? Is he manipulative and controlling? Love is a powerful emotion. Should people use love to control others? Miranda can't understand why her father is being so abrupt with Ferdinand. She has fallen in love at first sight with Ferdinand. I I : Love - Miranda admits that she has feelings for Ferdinand. It is the first time she has ever felt this way. Do you think that she would have fallen in love with Ferdinand even without Prospero's magic? She wishes that her father could see things from her point of view. When Ferdinand offers to make Miranda his queen, Prospero steps in. He is worried that his plan won't work if Ferdinand wins Miranda's heart too easily. L L : Prospero says: 'But this swift business I must uneasy make, lest too light winning/Make the prize light'. He means that he can't let Ferdinand think that it was too easy to get Miranda to be his girlfriend, because he might not treat her well if it's really easy to make her love him. He says that Ferdinand is lying about being a king and accuses him of being a spy. I I : Power/ Illusion - Prospero wants to manipulate Ferdinand. He will make him suffer and work hard for Miranda's love. When Ferdinand claims to have some power of his own as the heir to the throne, Prospero takes this power away by accusing him of being a spy and taking him prisoner. Prospero knows that Ferdinand is the heir to the throne. 'The Tempest' is all about the confusion between what is true and real, and what is illusion. Miranda tries to speak up for him C C : You might think that Miranda is brave to speak up for Ferdinand. Apart from being a powerful magician, Prospero has quite a temper! Her speech also shows us how innocent she is. She can't believe that anyone who looks so lovely on the outside can be anything other than lovely on the inside. In 'The Tempest', Shakespeare shows us that things are not always as they first seem. but Prospero tells her off and threatens to imprison Ferdinand. L L : Prospero calls Ferdinand a 'traitor'. He threatens to 'manacle' his neck and give him sea water to drink and acorn shells to eat. Prospero doesn't mean any of these threats, but in making them he shows that he has power over Ferdinand and could make him a slave just as he made Caliban his slave. Throughout the extract, Prospero uses words like 'usurp', 'traitor' and 'impostor' which all seem a bit strong when referring to Ferdinand. When Antonio took Prospero's place as Duke of Milan, he did 'usurp' him, and in doing so, he was a 'traitor' and in calling himself the Duke of Milan, Antonio is an 'imposter'. When Ferdinand draws his sword, Prospero uses magic to make it impossible for Ferdinand to move. Miranda tries desperately to stop her father but he won't listen. Ferdinand comes to the conclusion that all his problems - his father's death, the shipwreck, Prospero's threats - mean nothing, as long as he can see Miranda once a day, even if he is in prison. I I : Love/ Illusion - Ferdinand suddenly doesn't mind being Prospero's prisoner, as long as he has Miranda to love. He says it's all like a 'dream'. Does love have that kind of dream-like power to overcome difficulties? Or is it another one of Prospero's spells? Prospero is pleased that his plan to make Ferdinand fall in love with Miranda has worked. He praises Ariel I I : Love/ Illusion - When Prospero tells Ariel that he has done well, this suggests that Miranda and Ferdinand's attraction towards one another is not true love, but a magic trick, an illusion, that Ariel has conjured. and whispers some more instructions. Prospero promises Ariel that he will be free I I : Freedom and Slavery - Just as Prospero has made Caliban a slave and threatened to imprison Ferdinand, he has the power to set Ariel free. When Prospero arrived on the island, Ariel was trapped in a pine tree and Prospero set him free, so he has a debt of gratitude towards him. Also, Ariel is gentle whereas Prospero has a temper. It could be that Ariel is a little afraid of his master. if he carries out all of his commands. Ariel agrees. Prospero orders Ferdinand to follow him and tells Miranda not to try and speak up for him.	5
There are four characters in this first extract and all but Ariel appear again in the second extract. He is a sorcerer. He has power over the magic spirits that exist on the island. He used to be the Duke of Milan until he was usurped by his brother, Antonio. He conjures the storm that shipwrecks the King of Naples, along with his brother Antonio. He wants justice for having been exiled on the island twelve years ago. He is Miranda's father. Part of his plan is, with Ariel's help, to make Miranda fall in love with Ferdinand through magic. She is Prospero's daughter. She has been alone on the island with her father, Caliban and Ariel for twelve years. Ferdinand is the first man she has ever seen. She wants to marry Ferdinand. She does not understand why Prospero is being so unreasonable to Ferdinand. Her father controls her but it could be argued that she has an independent spirit. He is a sprite. He can make himself invisible and perform magic. He is an obedient servant to Prospero. When Prospero arrived on the island, Ariel was trapped in a pine tree by the witch, Sycorax, Caliban's mother. Prospero set him free. He is shipwrecked in the storm. Ariel's song convinces him that his father is dead. His father is the King of Naples. He is in love with Miranda and prepared to become Prospero's slave for her sake.	5
"When talking about the language, the things to concentrate on are: The example below is about power. Take a look, then think about how you might answer a question on how the characters talk about magic and illusion Prospero is a controlling character who seems to be obsessed with power and status. Ferdinand is a prince, but he has no status on Prospero's magic island. Prospero pretends not to believe that Ferdinand is the heir to the throne of Naples and insists on taking him prisoner. He calls him a ""spy"", a ""traitor"", and an ""impostor"". He accuses him of lying. He threatens to ""manacle"" him and starve him. He uses his magic powers to prevent Ferdinand from defending himself. He also has control over Ariel and even talks about how his daughter will have ""control"" over Ferdinand when he falls in love with her. Prospero is only pretending to be cruel and unwelcoming to Ferdinand as part of his plan, but it seems as though he is enjoying himself in the process. Even Miranda is alarmed at his behaviour. The extract seems to suggest that Miranda and Ferdinand's love for each other will turn out to have a power that is stronger even than Prospero's magic."	5
The whole play deals with lots of different ideas, but in the First Key Extract the main ones are: Most questions require answers that cover several aspects of the play (remember CLIP!). For instance, if you get a question about the role of Prospero, you need to talk about more than just the performance. You could write about:	5
When you talk about the performance of a play, you should think about how people in the audience feel as they watch it. For instance, the beginning of the first extract is magical and romantic. The tone changes in the middle to one of conflict. Prospero has lots of asides (thoughts spoken aloud) in the first extract. His role in this scene is made more complex because his character is pretending to be something he is not. The director has to decide whether he wants us to see Prospero as a good father who wants the best for his daughter or a manipulative control freak. Prospero also speaks to Ariel who is invisible to the other characters on the stage. When Ariel appears, the director must decide how to present the 'illusion'. Ariel is invisible to the other characters. But it does not necessarily follow that he must be invisible to the audience, too. Try to imagine as many interesting and unusual ways to present Ariel - the 'invisible' sprite - as you can. When you write about performance, you need to mention the tone or feeling you get at a particular point in the play, and the effect it might have on the audience. You can find evidence for your ideas in the four question areas: The language used - the detail about freedom and slavery, for example The issues and ideas - like love, magic and power The performance instructions, such as stage directions	5
In this extract, Miranda comes to see Ferdinand while he is carrying logs. Prospero is secretly watching and overhears them say they love each other. He finally approves of their love. This Revision Bite covers:	5
In front of PROSPERO's cave. Enter FERDINAND, carrying a log. (Putting down the log) There be some sports are painful, and their labour Delight in them sets off. Some kinds of baseness Are nobly undergone, and most poor matters Point to rich ends. This my mean task Would be as heavy to me as odious, but The mistress which I serve quickens what's dead, And makes my labours pleasures. O, she is Ten times more gentle than her father's crabbed â€“ And he's composed of harshness! I must remove Some thousands of these logs, and pile them up, Upon a sore injunction. My sweet mistress Weeps when she sees me work, and says such baseness (He picks up the log again) â€“ But these sweet thoughts do even refresh my labours, Most busiest, when I do it. PROSPERO, who watches from a distance, unseen. Work not so hard! I would the lightning had Burnt up those logs that you are enjoined to pile! Pray, set it down, and rest you. When this burns, 'Twill weep for having wearied you. My father He's safe for these three hours. What I must strive to do. If you'll sit down. I'll bear your logs the while. Pray give me that: I'll carry it to the pile. Than you should such dishonour undergo, With much more ease, for my good will is to it, And yours it is against. (Aside)Poor worm, thou art infected! This visitation shows it. You look wearily. When you are by at night. I do beseech you â€“ (Putting down the log) What is your name? I have broke your hest to say so! What's dearest to the world! Full many a lady I have eyed with best regard, and many a time Brought my too diligent ear. For several virtues With so full soul, but some defect in her Did quarrel with the noblest grace she owed, And put it to the foil. But you â€“ o you, Of every creature's best! One of my sex â€“ no woman's face remember, Save, from my glass, mine own. Nor have I seen More that I may call men than you, good friend, And my dear father. How features are abroad, I am skilless of â€“ but, by my modesty, The jewel in my dower, I would not wish Nor can imagination form a shape, Besides yourself, to like of. But I prattle Something too wildly, and my father's precepts I therein do forget. I am, in my condition, A prince, Miranda: I do think, a King I would not so! â€“ and would no more endure The flesh-fly blow my mouth. Hear my soul speak: The very instant that I saw you, did My heart fly to your service â€“ there resides, Am I this patient log-man. O heaven, O earth, bear witness to this sound And crown what I profess with kind event, If I speak true! If hollowly, invert What best is boded me to mischief! I, Beyond all limit of what else i'the world, Do love, prize, honour you. To weep at what I am glad of. Of two most rare affections! Heavens rain grace On that which breeds between 'em! Wherefore weep you? At mine unworthiness, that dare not offer What I desire to give; and much less take What I shall die to want. But this is trifling â€“ And all the more it seeks to hide itself, The bigger bulk it shows. Hence, bashful cunning! And prompt me, plain and holy innocence! I am your wife if you will marry me: You may deny me; but I'll be your servant, Whether you will or no. (He kneels) And I thus humble ever. My husband, then? Ay, with a heart as willing As bondage e'er of freedom! Here's my hand. And mine, with my heart in't. And now farewell Till half an hour hence. A thousand thousand! ? Exit MIRANDA. Exit FERDINAND, separately, carrying the log. So glad of this as they I cannot be, At nothing can be more. I'll to my book â€“ For yet, ere supper-time, must I perform Much business appertaining.	5
In this section you will see buttons at the end of some paragraphs. These will give you extra information. If you want this information, just mouse over the buttons as you read through. The Second Key Extract takes place outside Prospero's cave. Ferdinand is carrying logs. He thinks to himself that he doesn't mind the hard work because he is doing it for Miranda, C C : Ferdinand's soliloquy (speech that represents a character's thoughts) at the beginning of this section tell us a lot about him. He is a prince, but he understands that hard work can make even the commonest man noble. even if her father is cruel and grumpy. C C : Ferdinand says that Prospero is 'crabbed'. Miranda says later that Prospero isn't always like this. Is this just an act that Prospero is putting on as part of his plan? You might argue that Ferdinand's description seems to be pretty accurate of Prospero for most of the play! Miranda comes to see him. Neither of them realise that Prospero is watching them from a distance. P P : On film, it is easy enough to show that a character is watching events from a distance, but how do you create the same effect on the more confined space of a stage? Can you think of some creative ways to show that Prospero is watching the lovers from a distance? Miranda begs Ferdinand to rest L L : Miranda says that the log that Ferdinand is carrying 'will weep for having wearied' him when it burns. This is a technique called personification: a kind of metaphor where an object is given human characteristics. You could say that Miranda's metaphor makes her seem quite child-like and innocent. but he says he has too much to do, so she offers to carry some logs for him. C C : In Shakespeare's lifetime, noble women were not expected to work. You might think to yourself that Miranda's offer to help Ferdinand carry the logs shows that she sees herself as his equal. He says he would rather break his back than see her work. Miranda insists again that she should help him. I I : Love/ Illusion - Miranda and Ferdinand recognise the sweetness within each other's character. They can't seem to do enough for each other. Their exchange with one another sounds more like true love than a magic trick at this point. Looking on, Prospero sees how much Miranda is in love with Ferdinand. L L : Prospero calls Miranda 'Poor worm' and says that being in love is like being 'infected' with a disease, perhaps like the plague. A 'visitation' in this case is an 'epidemic'. It's not a very romantic way to describe first love. You might wonder what this tells you about Prospero that he uses such language to describe love. Ferdinand asks Miranda her name and when she tells him, she remembers that in doing so, she has broken her promise to her father. I I : Illusion - Miranda thinks that Prospero will be angry with her for telling Ferdinand her name - Prospero has made her think that - but in reality, it is part of his plan to make the young couple fall in love Ferdinand admits that he has liked lots of different women in the past L L : Ferdinand uses the word 'bondage' to describe his reaction to listening to beautiful women talk. It links back to the issue of Freedom and Slavery in the play. Ferdinand means that he has been like a slave to beautiful women in the past. , but they have always disappointed him with some fault or other in the end. C C : Ferdinand admits that Miranda is not his first love. He has been in love with lots of beautiful women in the past. He has always found some fault with them. He says that Miranda is perfect! He called her a 'goddess' in the first extract. Do you think that Ferdinand is really in love with Miranda or do you think that it is Prospero's magic that makes him feel this way? However, Miranda, he says, is perfect. Miranda, on the other hand, hasn't met any men except for her father, or any women, except for herself. Even so, she says that she can't imagine liking anyone more than she likes Ferdinand. C C : In contrast with Ferdinand's experience, Miranda has never had a boyfriend. In fact, Ferdinand is the only man other than her dad that she has ever seen (apparantly, Caliban doesn't count). Ferdinand tells her that he is a prince, possibly a king (although he hopes his father isn't dead). He wouldn't usually put up with having to carry logs like a slave L L : Ferdinand compares his work for Prospero to slavery and says that he is a 'slave' to his love for Miranda. but he knew as soon as he saw Miranda that he'd do anything for her. When Miranda asks him if he loves her, Ferdinand says he loves, prizes and honours her more than anything else in the world. This makes Miranda so happy that she cries. As Prospero watches them together, he is moved. I I : Love/ Illusion - Having congratulated himself and Ariel all along for the success of their plan to get Miranda and Ferdinand together, Prospero finally seems to admit that the feelings his daughter and her lover have for one another move him. When he says to himself: 'Fair encounter/Of two most rare affections!' you could argue that he recognises that their love is not an illusion after all. Ferdinand asks Miranda why she is crying. She says she thinks she isn't good enough for him C C : Miranda seems to be a very modest character. She is so in love with Ferdinand she offers to be his servant. You might think that this shows that she is quite weak. In Shakespeare's time, men would have made all of the decisions concerning marriage, so you could argue that this shows Miranda to be strong, assertive and a little ahead of her time! but realising she is being silly, she tells Ferdinand she will be his wife if he wants to marry her, and even if he doesn't, she won't ever marry anyone else. Ferdinand happily agrees to marry her. They say goodbye and part. Prospero is happy for them, but he claims that their engagement is no surprise to him as it was all part of his plan. He goes to get his magic book because he has lots of work to do before supper time.	5
If you get a question about characters in the Key Extracts, here is how to use PEE to help you with the answer. Question: What do we learn about Miranda in the two extracts? In the two Key Extracts we learn that Miranda is young and inexperienced, but not necessarily weak. She has a pure heart and sees the best in Ferdinand and even defends Prospero. In the First Key Extract she must do what her father says, even though his behaviour is questionable. In the Second Key Extract, she knows her own mind and goes behind her father's back (or thinks she has) to ask Ferdinand to be her husband. Miranda can be read as a strong female character. Even though Prospero is a controlling father, Miranda shows from the beginning of the extract that she is beginning to test his power over her. She relies on her own judgement and questions her father's actions. She stands up for Ferdinand against her father and is on the receiving end of Prospero's ugly temper. She replies with dignity and even tries to excuse her father's bad behaviour to Ferdinand. However, throughout the first extract, she is being unwittingly manipulated by Prospero. In the second extract she openly defies her father (although it is part of Prospero's plan that she does this). She demonstrates that she is Ferdinand's equal by offering to share his workload. She claims that she is not worthy of him, but then shows her independence by proposing marriage. Miranda pleads with Prospero to see the best in Ferdinand, but perhaps her father, who is more experienced, is wise to test Ferdinand's love for his daughter. Miranda is open about her feelings for Ferdinand, but in doing so believes that she is betraying her father's wishes. Miranda is sometimes weak and sometimes strong. She is a complex character. Throughout the two extracts we see Miranda's growing independence. The truth is, however, that although she thinks she is rebelling against her father by following her own heart, her actions are part of Prospero's plans.	5
Think about how language is used in the two Key Extracts - for example, patterns of language that appear in both, or how language changes from the first to the second extract.	5
The two extracts deal with some deep issues. You will need to discuss how these are brought out. Some of the 'big' themes are: If the question asks you to comment on how the theme of power is explored, consider these points: In the first extract, Ariel's songs calm the storm and make Ferdinand believe that his father is dead. This puts Ferdinand in a weak position which makes it easier for Prospero to manipulate him. Ariel's magic powers are responsible for much of what happens in the play. Ariel only performs his magic so that he can win his freedom. Prospero has power over Ariel because Ariel owes him a debt of gratitude. It could be argued that Prospero's assertion of power and authority over Ferdinand is unnecessarily harsh. Prospero is obsessed with power and authority having had his title taken from him by his brother Antonio. As a prince, Ferdinand's royal power becomes redundant on Prospero's magic island. Prospero sees Miranda and Ferdinand's love as a power that he can use to manipulate Ferdinand. Miranda seems powerless under her father's control on the island. She rebels against him, but even her rebellion was part of Prospero's plan. Miranda and Ferdinand's love is a power that exists independently of magic.	5
There are a lot of different ways to perform a particular scene. How is the drama created in the two Key Extracts? From the table below, you will see there are elements of the two Key Extracts that are quite similar. But whereas there is a lot of conflict in the first extract, the second one is full of romance. This needs to be brought out in the performance. Once you understand how the audience should feel, you can decide how you might direct particular parts of the play. Answer the question you have, not the question you would like. Make a short plan. Use PEE.	5
In this section we address the influential ideas, basic plots and key themes in two of Shakespeare's plays.	5
Romeo and Juliet is a tragic love story about 'a pair of star-crossed lovers' from rival families. You need to know the basic plot, what the characters are like, and how they get along. You should also think about how actors should perform the play to an audience, and the main 'big' topics that it deals with. This Revision Bite covers: Marriage & murder	5
The play starts by telling us what will happen at the end. A girl and a boy from two warring families will die. Their deaths will put an end to the violence. The action is set in Verona in Italy. These equally rich and powerful families are: Two of Capulet's servants pick a fight in the market place with one of Montague's servants. Benvolio tries to stop the fight. Tybalt attacks Benvolio. A riot starts. Prince Escalus stops the riot and warns that if the Montagues and the Capulets are involved in any more violence the punishment will be death. Luckily, Romeo wasn't involved, but his mother and father wonder where he is. Benvolio has seen him moodily wandering about by himself. He says he will try to find out what is wrong with Romeo. Romeo tells Benvolio that he is in love with a girl called Rosaline. He is in agony because she doesn't love him back. Benvolio's advice is to look at other attractive girls. Romeo says that no other girl could ever live up to Rosaline.	5
Meanwhile, a nobleman called Paris visits Capulet to ask him if he can marry Juliet. Capulet asks him to wait two more summers, but suggest he romances his daughter and invites Paris to a party that evening. He gives his servant a list of names of people to invite. The servant can't read. He bumps into Benvolio and Romeo and asks them to read the list for him. Rosaline's name, amongst others, is on the list. The servant doesn't know that Benvolio and Romeo are Montagues and invites them to the party, too. Lady Capulet is sent to tell Juliet about Paris's proposal. They aren't very close so she asks Juliet's Nurse to stay and listen. Juliet will be fourteen on Lammas-eve, 31st July. Juliet tells her mother that she has never thought about marriage, but promises to take a look at Paris.	5
Romeo and his friends decide to gate-crash the party. Romeo has a bad feeling about the outcome of this evening, but decides to let fate take its course. Capulet is having a great time at his party. People are dancing. Romeo and his friends arrive wearing masks. Romeo spots Juliet. He thinks to himself that he didn't really know what true beauty was until he saw her. He doesn't know that she is a Capulet. Tybalt recognises Romeo from his voice and threatens to kill him because he is a Montague, but Capulet stops him. Romeo and Juliet flirt and finally kiss. The Nurse tells Romeo that Juliet is a Capulet and he is dismayed. He leaves with Benvolio. Juliet is distraught when the Nurse tells her who Romeo is. The Chorus recaps events for us: Romeo has forgotten Rosaline and is now in love with Juliet. Juliet feels the same way. Romeo runs away from his friends. Mercutio shouts rude things because he thinks Romeo has gone off to find Rosaline. Romeo hides in the Capulets' garden and watches Juliet who is on a balcony outside her bedroom. Juliet doesn't know that he is there at first and, talking to herself, declares her love for him. She is shocked and embarrassed when he replies. They have only met that evening, but they know that they love each other. Juliet promises to send a messenger to him in the morning to find out where and what time their wedding will be! They find it difficult to part. Romeo goes to see Friar Lawrence, the priest, who is worried that he has spent the night with Rosaline. When Romeo says that he wants to marry Juliet, Friar Lawrence tells him off for falling in love so easily, but agrees to the wedding because he thinks that it might be a solution to the rift between the Capulets and the Montagues.	5
Meanwhile, Benvolio tells Mercutio that Tybalt has sent a letter to Montague's house challenging Romeo to a duel. Mercutio jokes about how good a swordsman Tybalt is, comparing him to a dancer. He calls him Prince of Cats. When Romeo turns up, Mercutio makes lots of rude jokes, and Romeo, who is now in a good mood joins in. The Nurse warns Romeo not to mess Juliet around. He tells her that the wedding will be that afternoon at Friar Lawrence's place. The Nurse is really excited. When the Nurse arrives back at the Capulet's house, Juliet is beside herself with impatience. The Nurse teases her and makes her wait for the good news. Juliet meets Romeo at Friar Lawrence's and they go off to get secretly married. Meanwhile, Mercutio squabbles with Benvolio. Benvolio is worried that the Capulets might turn up looking for a fight. Tybalt appears looking for Romeo. Mercutio teases him. Romeo arrives and refuses to fight Tybalt. Romeo tells him he loves him! (It's because Tybalt is now his relation through marriage, but he can't tell anyone that because the wedding is still a secret!) Mercutio fights Tybalt in Romeo's place. Romeo gets between them and, as a result, Mercutio is fatally wounded. He dies cursing both families. Romeo's grief at his friend's death quickly turns to rage. He kills Tybalt. Remembering Prince Escalus's warnings, Benvolio begs Romeo to run away. Lady Capulet wants Romeo to be put to death for murdering Tybalt, but Prince Escalus points out that Tybalt killed Mercutio. He orders that Romeo should be sent away from Verona and not allowed back.	5
Juliet can't wait for her wedding night. But when the Nurse tells her what happened to Tybalt, Juliet doesn't know whether to love or hate Romeo. She can't believe that he is being sent away and threatens to kill herself, so the Nurse promises to find Romeo and bring him to Juliet's bedroom. Friar Lawrence is hiding Romeo. When he tells Romeo what Prince Escalus has decided, Romeo says that he would rather die than be sent away. The Nurse arrives. Romeo tries to stab himself, but the Nurse and the Friar stop him. The Friar gives Romeo a good telling off for being so ungrateful and for behaving like a girl! He and the Nurse arrange for Romeo to spend his last night in Verona with Juliet as long as he promises to leave for Mantua first thing in the morning. The Capulets are grieving for Tybalt. Paris comes to see Juliet but she won't come down from her bedroom. Capulet tells Paris that he will sort things out between them because he is sure his daughter will do what he tells her to do. He suggests that Paris marries her on Thursdayâ€¦It is now Monday. Romeo and Juliet have spent the night together. Juliet hears a lark (larks sing at dawn), but tries to persuade Romeo that it was a nightingale (nightingales sing at night) because she doesn't want the night to end. When Romeo says that he will stay and face death for her, Juliet changes her mind and makes him hurry to get up and leave. Juliet has a premonition of him dead in a grave.	5
Juliet's mother tells her to cheer up because her father has arranged for her to marry Paris. Juliet loses her temper and refuses. Her father comes in and can't believe how ungrateful she is being. He threatens to throw her out and disown her. He says he wants to hit her. She asks her mother to stand up for her, but she refuses. When Juliet's mother and father have left, Juliet asks the Nurse what she should do. The Nurse says to forget Romeo and just marry Paris without owning up. In those days, that would have been a sin, and to marry two people at once would mean that she would be sent to hell. Juliet says that she will do what the Nurse suggests, but when she leaves the room, Juliet says to herself that the Nurse is two-faced. She decides to see if Friar Lawrence will help her. If not, she thinks she will have to commit suicide. Paris goes to visit Friar Lawrence to arrange his wedding to Juliet. The Friar tries to stall for more time. When Juliet arrives, she gives Paris 'the cold shoulder' until he leaves. She begs the Friar to help her, threatening to kill herself. The Friar has a plan if Juliet has the guts to carry it through. He knows of a drug that will make her seem as though she is dead for forty-two hours. This will mean that she will be put in the family tomb along with Tybalt. Then the Friar will let Romeo know the truth, so that he can come and take her away when she wakes up and they can go off together to Mantua. Juliet isn't scared. She takes the drug home with her. Everyone is busy with wedding preparations at the Capulets' house. Capulet is in a good mood. Juliet tells her father that she has been to see the Friar to confess her sins and asks for her dad's forgiveness. Even the Nurse believes her. Juliet says good night to her mum then starts to panic about what she is about to do. She might die. She might go mad when she wakes up in a tomb full of dead people. There might be ghosts. She imagines that she sees Tybalt's ghost. She takes the poison and falls unconscious on her bed. The Nurse finds Juliet and thinks she is dead. She is beside herself with grief. The family comes running and her mother and father can't believe it. Friar Lawrence arrives pretending that he has come to take Juliet to church to marry Paris. Paris comes and is shocked at the news.	5
Meanwhile, in Mantua, Romeo waits for news. A servant called Balthasar arrives and tells Romeo that he has heard that Juliet has died. Romeo decides to buy some poison. He plans to go to see Juliet's body where he will take the poison and die next to her. Meanwhile, Friar John explains to Friar Lawrence that the letter he wanted him to take to Romeo explaining the truth about Juliet didn't get delivered. Friar Lawrence decides to go to the tomb and wait for Juliet to wake up while he sends another letter to Romeo. That same evening, Paris goes to Juliet's tomb with some flowers. He hears a noise and decides to investigate. Romeo pays Balthasar off and breaks into the Capulet tomb. Paris tries to stop him. Romeo begs him to leave him alone, but Paris thinks he is vandalising the tomb. They fight. Romeo kills Paris. Just before Paris dies he asks Romeo to place him next to Juliet's body. Romeo is sad that he had to kill Paris and takes him into the tomb to be near Juliet. When Romeo sees Juliet lying in the tomb, he can't believe that she is dead because she looks so beautiful. He hugs her and kisses her. He takes the poison then kisses her again and dies. Friar Lawrence finds the bodies of Paris and Romeo just as Juliet is about to wake up. Juliet wakes up and asks the Friar where Romeo is. He hears a noise and begs Juliet to come away with him, but when she finds out that Romeo is dead, she refuses to go with him. Friar Lawrence runs away. Juliet tries to kiss the poison off Romeo's lips. His lips are still warm, but there is not enough poison left on them to kill her. She takes his dagger and stabs herself. Some watchmen discover the bodies outside the tomb. They also find the Friar who is crying and shaking. Prince Escalus and Juliet's mother and father arrive with Romeo's father. Friar Lawrence tells them all the truth about the wedding and their children's deaths. He feels so guilty that he asks the Prince to punish him, but Prince Escalus won't because the Friar is a holy man. Prince Escalus blames Montague and Capulet, but he also blames himself for not doing enough to stop the violence. Capulet and Montague decide to end their rift. Montague offers to have a statue of Juliet made. The play ends as the Prince says that this is the saddest story ever told.	5
This Revision Bite will give you a general summary of The Tempest. You need to know the basic plot then work out what the people in the play are like, and how they get along. You should also think about how actors should perform the play to an audience, and the main 'big' topics - such as love, time, truth - that it deals with. This Revision Bite covers:	5
The play opens on board a ship that is being battered by a storm - or tempest. The ship's crew are hard at work trying to stop the ship from sinking. Some passengers go up on deck. Alonso, the King of Naples Sebastian, Alonso's brother Antonio, brother of Prospero (a magician, who appears later) Ferdinand, Alonso's son Gonzalo, a servant of Alonso They think they are going to drown. The action moves to an island near where the ship is in trouble. Prospero, a magician, and his daughter Miranda, are living on the island with two others. One is Ariel (a sprite, or elf-like character) - who'd once been kept in a tree by an evil witch, Sycorax. Prospero had released him from the tree with his magic. The other is Caliban (big and nasty, the son of Sycorax) - who Prospero had been kind to. Both Ariel and Caliban are Prospero's servants. Prospero, we now learn, had caused the storm on purpose. It was because of something that had happened long ago, as he tells Miranda ... Twelve years earlier, he says, Prospero was the much loved Duke of Milan, a great city in Italy. Miranda was a young princess. Prospero was always reading. This meant that his brother Antonio (who is on the ship in the storm) had so much power that he wanted more, and plotted against Prospero, with the help of the King, Alonso. One night, Prospero tells Miranda, he and Miranda were seized, and sent out to sea alone in an open boat. They were lucky to survive, although Prospero's magic books were on the boat. Finally they came ashore on the island where they now live. When his story is over, Prospero makes Miranda sleep before calling for Ariel, to find out how the plans he has made for the ship in the storm are going.	5
"Ariel tells Prospero what has happened to the ship and its passengers and crew. He tells how he appeared on the ship as a flame (he is after all a magic spirit), and frightened the passengers so much that they had jumped in to the sea. Only the crew remained on the ship. Prospero wants to be sure that the crew and the passengers are safe. Ariel tells him how he saw to it that the passengers were washed up on the island in separate groups. He made sure the ship was safe, and that the crew were sleeping peacefully. He had sent the rest of the fleet back to Naples, with everyone believing that their king's ship had been sunk, and its passengers drowned. Ariel now changes the subject, and says he's getting impatient. He reminds Prospero there is a time limit on how long he had to be Prospero's servant, after his release from Sycorax's spell. Ariel wants his freedom, and reminds Prospero that he's been a good servant. Prospero, in reply, reminds Ariel of the horror he was released from. He tells him that he needs him to work for two more days and then he will be free. Prospero sends him off to keep watch over the washed-up passengers. As Ariel leaves, Prospero wakes Miranda and tells her that they are going to see Caliban. This doesn't please Miranda, who refers to Caliban as a ""villain"" that she does not ""love to look on"". It is clear, too, from the names he calls him, that Prospero has not forgiven Caliban for an attack he once made on his daughter."	5
"Ariel brings Ferdinand (the King's son) to Prospero's cave. Ferdinand thinks he's the only survivor from the shipwreck. Miranda, who has seen no other man but her father during her time on the island, sees Ferdinand and thinks he must be a spirit - while Ferdinand thinks Miranda is a goddess. The two young people fall in love, but Prospero is not pleased, and makes Ferdinand his prisoner. On another part of the island we discover one of the groups of shipwreck survivors. They begin to wake up. They're surprised that their clothes seem fresh and new. Ariel's magical song puts them to sleep again - all except Sebastian (the King's brother) and Antonio (Prospero's brother). Antonio convinces Sebastian that they should kill the King (Alonso) so that Sebastian can take his place. Fortunately everyone else wakes up again, before they can carry out their plan. Elsewhere on the island, Trinculo, a jester who was on board the ship, comes across Caliban. Trinculo's drunken friend Stephano turns up, and gives Caliban strong alcohol. This makes Caliban believe that Stephano is more powerful than Prospero (who Caliban hates). Meanwhile, Ariel, who has made himself invisible, watches the three drunken clowns. He causes havoc by whispering the accusation ""thou liest"" in Caliban's ear, then Stephano's. They become confused and fight. Caliban reveals his plans to destroy Prospero and take over the island. Stephano drunkenly agrees. Caliban is delighted that Stephano has agreed to his plan and they sing to celebrate. Ariel plays a tune to accompany their singing which frightens both Trinculo and Stephano. Caliban tells them not to be afraid in a moving speech that describes the beauty and magic of the island. Stephano, Trinculo and Caliban follow the sound of the music."	5
"Miranda comes to see Ferdinand while he is carrying logs. Prospero is secretly watching and overhears Ferdinand and Miranda say they love each other. He finally approves of their love. On their way to see Prospero, to kill him, Caliban and Stephano discuss horrible ways of murdering him. Ariel overhears them and makes them go in the wrong direction, with soothing, magical music. In another part of the island, King Alonso and his companions sit down to rest. Prospero and Ariel cause the spirits of the island to prepare them a wonderful banquet. But at their first taste, Ariel appears to them. He accuses the ""three men of sin"" (Alonso, Antonio and Sebastian - plotters all) of their crimes. They are warned that they will suffer a nasty death unless they are truly sorry and live a ""clear life"" in the future. Only Alonso will admit what he has done. A little way away, Prospero tells Ferdinand that he will no longer punish him, but instead will give him his daughter's hand in marriage. Prospero makes a beautiful illusion of a party appear, to celebrate. Prospero tells Ariel to lead most of the other survivors on the island to him. But remembering Caliban, Trinculo and Stephano's plot against him, Prospero tells Ariel to keep them away from him. Ariel leads them on a wild goose chase ending up in a smelly pool. They are soon attacked by spirits in the form of dogs. Prospero is pleased with Ariel, and promises he'll soon be free."	5
Prospero has Alonso, Antonio and Sebastian in his power. He has them imprisoned, with other survivors (except Trinculo and Stephano who are still with Caliban) in a trance, by his cave. He tells Ariel to fetch them to him. He says that although it would be understandable if he took revenge on them, he would forgive them if they were sorry for what they had done to him. He also tells Ariel that he will soon be free, and tells him he will miss him. Ariel leaves to fetch the group. Prospero, alone, declares that he will give up his magic, break his magic staff and throw his magic books into the sea as soon as this business is over. When Ariel brings the men back, Prospero places them in a magic circle. After telling them off for the wrong things they have done, he releases them from his spell, so they can now wake up. In order that they will recognise him as they awaken, Prospero sends Ariel to fetch his Duke's clothing and sword. The men slowly start to come to their senses. They recognise Prospero, but are amazed to see him in such a strange place. Alonso is very ashamed of what he has done.	5
This is the scene where Prospero forgives Alonso, and also tells Sebastian and Antonio he will keep their plan to kill Alonso secret, forgiving them both too. Later he even forgives Trinculo and Stephano. Prospero tells Alonso that he has lost his daughter, just as Alonso (who still thinks Ferdinand is drowned) has lost his son - but he means in marriage. He draws back a curtain to show the two young lovers playing chess. The ship's captain brings news that the ship is safe, and all prepare for the return to Naples for the wedding of Ferdinand and Miranda. All except for Ariel, who is given his freedom, and Caliban, who will stay on the island.	5

This Revision Bite will show you what to expect when your teacher sets a drama project for a speaking and listening assessment. You will be asked to work from a script as well as make one up. Sometimes you will work in a group and occcasionally you will work individually. This Revision Bite covers:	5
Taking part in drama doesn't always involve learning lines from scripts - often you'll be asked to improvise. Usually you will work in groups or pairs to devise a piece of drama from your own imagination. You'll need to be able to think on your feet and become a different character. This might sound difficult, but you've probably improvised before without realising it - in games you used to play as a child. If you've ever played pirates, nurses or superheroes when you were younger, you were improvising - although don't think running around your classroom with a tablecloth for a cape pretending to be Superman will impress your drama teacher - it probably won't! As with any English work, you need to think about your audience when you devise drama. Your drama needs to entertain them and keep their attention. Your drama also needs to be believable - your audience is likely to become disconnected if your story or characters are too far fetched. The story of your drama begins with your character. Ask yourself: what does my character feel, think and react? Here are two ideas for a character: You are a journalist who has uncovered a story that will have big consequences and you're about to tell the world. Would your character be confident or scared? You are a global superstar - singer, actor and producer - and paparazzi follow your every move. You live a glamorous and privileged life, but what are the secrets behind the smiles? When you have decided on your character, you need to create a scene. Here are some ideas for a scene based on the characters above. Can you think of any more? When you have a rough idea of your character and scene, you can think about what your character might say. If you're given time to prepare you should write a short script. If working in pairs or a group, you could improvise the scene first to get more ideas. You may be allowed to use props to make your scene more realistic and interesting. Only use a prop if it is relevant, otherwise it could end up distracting you and your audience. If you decide to use props and costumes, always practice with them first.	5
There are many ways to start off an improvisation. One way is to take a prop and imagine what it could be. Think of some ways to improvise a use for these everyday items and check your ideas against ours. An empty kitchen roll could be: a trumpet, a phial containing a precious potion, a wand, a telescope, a scroll containing a deadly secret. A paper plate could be: a steering wheel, a shield, a window into another world, a helmet that allows you to read people's thoughts, a miniature flying saucer. A plactic cup could be: a gas mask, an ants' nest, a cup containing a liquid that turns you into a monster with just one sip, the home of a very small but very poisonous snake Once you've come up with an idea, you can create a story together. The best improvisations happen through teamwork. One person's idea will grow if other people add imaginative ideas. If one actor takes over, the others are left not knowing what to do. It's important to make sure that you give everyone an equal chance to play. And, if they're struggling, help them subtly.	5
Sometimes your teacher will 'hot seat' a student at a crucial moment in the book or play that the class is reading. That person has to pretend they are the character in the story at that very moment. They have to speak, think and feel as though they are that character. If you've read any of the books and plays below, you could practise the art of 'hot seating'. Focus on the emotions (eg surprise, excitement, terror, anger, happiness, sadness, confusion) that your character is feeling at that moment. Harry Potter after his first kiss in The Order of the Phoenix. Lyra as she watches Lord Asriel kissing Marisa Coulter in Northern Lights. Ferdinand in The Tempest when Ariel sings the song that makes him think that his dad is dead. Juliet in Romeo and Juliet, when she discovers that Tybalt has been killed. Hot seating helps actors get into character. If you can think, feel and speak like that character, an audience is more likely to believe you are that character.	5
There's much more to acting than just reading a script out loud. If you're nervous, it's tempting to read the lines really quickly, using the same tone of voice all the way through, but this isn't very interesting for your audience. Try to think of the punctuation as musical notes telling you when to pause for a breath (or for dramatic effect!). Don't be tempted to take a little break at the end of each line - the piece might not make sense. To understand this, first read the script below, pausing at the end of each line. Then try again using the punctuation as your guide for when to pause. Juliet is waiting for the nurse to come home and tell her whether the wedding with Romeo is still on. Time is ticking and she's pretty fed up. The clock struck nine when I did send the Nurse; In half an hour she promised to return. Perchance she cannot meet him. That's not so. O, she is lame! Love's heralds should be thoughts, Which ten times faster glide than the sun's beams, Driving back shadows over lowering hills. Therefore do nimble-pinion'd doves draw Love, And therefore hath the wind-swift Cupid wings. Of this day's journey, and from nine till twelve Is three long hours, yet she is not come. She would be as swift in motion as a ball: My words would bandy her to my sweet love, And his to me. But old folks, many feign as they were dead - Unwieldy, slow, heavy, and pale as lead. Which way worked better? Using the punctuation as your guide makes it sound like a real person thinking aloud.	5
Being able to recognise changes in mood and emotion in a script is important as you need to convey this to your audience. Actors do this through: Volume, tone and pace of voice Using these methods, decide how you would express the emotion of anger. What happens to your face, body and voice when you feel angry? How do you walk when you're in a bad mood? Which gestures do you use to show someone you're angry with them? Facial expression: Frown, tightly clenched jaw, a tight mouth or even bared teeth. Body language: Tense shoulders, a swift and purposeful walk almost like a march. Gesture: Strong and forceful gestures. Perhaps even clenched fists. Volume, tone and pace: Either very loud and out of control or very quiet and menacing. Pauses: Maybe if you're very angry you won't pause often, you'll talk very quickly without giving the other person a chance to talk. Or the pauses might be long - a deafening silence! Now try this with other emotions, eg surprise, excitement, happiness, sadness. See how your body, face and voice change with each emotion. Another way to practise emotions is to do mood walks - put all the elements together to develop a walk that represents each emotion, then greet (or growl at) people with the appropriate tone of voice.	5
When you go to the theatre, you will see how the stage is transformed into a different place or time that the audience can believe in. This atmosphere is created through: At the beginning of William Shakespeare's play Hamlet, guards patrolling the castle wall at night are waiting for a ghost to reappear - they're afraid. They think it's the ghost of Hamlet's father who's just died. They call Hamlet's friend Horatio to come and see if the ghost will appear again. What techniques could you use to create the right atmosphere for this scene? Think about: Guard's costume You need to create an atmosphere that is spooky and frightening. Backdrop - Grey castle walls. The scene is set in a castle. Props - Swords for the guards, dry ice for mist. Dry ice will make it harder to see what's happening and create tension. Guard's costume - Grey uniforms. The audience need to recognise that these characters are guards. Ghost costume - No costume, you don't want the ghost to be seenâ€¦just a booming voice. Sometimes things are more frightening when you can't see them! The booming voice will give the ghost power.	5
"Are you a big show-off or a class clown? Note down your answer to these questions and then 'click ideas' below to see what kind of performer you are. 1. When your teacher announces that it's time for a drama lesson, do you: a) Stand up waving your arms frantically to ensure you get the best part. b) Immediately start sword fighting your friend with a ruler. c) Pack away your pens and books and prepare to get into character. 2. Your teacher says that you'll start by warming up. Do you: a) Pull on your tights and leggings and begin limbering up. b) Run really fast round the room, punching your friends. c) Shed your embarrassment in case you're asked to do something unusual and prepare to focus. 3. Your teacher asks you to bring in a costume and some props. Do you: a) Come in full Elizabethan costume with wig and authentic make-up. b) Stuff some balloons up your jumper. c) Bring in a couple of hats and your little brother's plastic sword and hope that you can come up with something by sharing what you've got with your friends. 4. Your teacher asks if anyone is prepared to be hot seated. Do you: a) Jump up and down with your hand up shouting ""Me! Me! Me!"" b) Nudge your friend and giggle as you pretend your bum has been burnt. c) Avoid the teacher's eye as you'd rather it wasn't you. 5. Your group has been chosen to show the rest of the class their improvisation. Do you: a) Take over. Your group is nothing without you. In fact, they'd be better off sitting down and letting you get on with it. b) Laugh so much that no one can see the good work you were doing before the focus was placed on you. c) Swallow your shyness, keep your nerves steady and try your best to work as a team. 6. Your group is reading out a play together. Do you: a) Insist on the biggest role, perhaps even two or three roles. You could play them all brilliantly and better than anyone else. b) Keep losing your place and laughing, then read in a silly or monotone voice to hide your embarrassment. c) Offer to narrate or read the stage directions, although secretly you'd love to take a big role. 7. You are asked to help design the set for the school play. Do you: a) Get out your paintbrushes, start creating an artistic masterpiece, and then ask what the play is about. b) Take the chance to muck about. It's really good fun being behind the scenes. c) Find out what the play is about and how the actors intend to use the space, then help design something suitable. What kind of performer are you? Big show-off You are talented and enthusiastic and uniquely you. You have plenty to give to any performance, but perhaps you need to focus your energy, listen to others more and try not to indulge yourself in those diva-style tantrums. Class Clown You mess around in drama to hide the fact that actually you'd secretly like to be the star of the show. You are the class clown but imagine how great you could be if you started to take drama seriously. The Rock By nature, you're not a show-off, but you do try your best in drama. Your serious and conscientious approach is essential to hold things together."	5

In this Revision Bite you'll learn how to show you're listening, what questions to ask and how to argue. Your teacher will assess your speaking and listening skills during discussions, speeches, debates and drama. You might be asked to do these on your own, in a pair or a group. This Revision Bite covers:	5
It sounds weird, but you can show that you are a good listener by talking! The trick is to know what to say and when to say it. Good listeners show that they are listening by: Repeating, in their own words, what the person has said to show that they understand Read this conversation between Abdul, Emily and Matt. Can you find any examples of good listening skills? In a classroom. General classroom noise in the background. In a fight, right, who do you think would win - (Interrupts) Shut up, Abdul! I'm trying to concentrate. The Teletubbies or Bob the Builder? That's just stupid - grow up. It's not. It is. I reckon Bob. No way, man. Bob's a loser. No. I reckon Bob. So why d'you reckon the Teletubbies? There's four of them. They'd take him down. Knock him cold. So you're saying that Tinky Winky and Laa-Laa have a violent streak? No, but if they had to, if they were forced - them against him - the Teletubbies would have it, any day of the week. Because it would be four against one? Yeah, the Teletubbies are a team. Bob's a Larry. Shut up! Choose the statement that is most true:	5
"Questioning is an important skill that shows your teacher that you are listening carefully. There are two main types of questions. These are the type of questions where there is only a yes or no answer or only one possible answer: eg Are you male or female? These questions let the person answering share their thoughts and ideas more fully: eg What do you think of the new English teacher? You can show that you are listening carefully to the answer of a closed or open question, by asking another question: ""What exactly do you mean by that?"" Or by checking that you've understood correctly by repeating back to that person what you thought they meant: ""So, you're saying that you think that violence is never the right answer?"" For their Speaking and Listening assessment, Matt has been paired with Tim. Matt has to interview Tim about his favourite character in the play, Romeo and Juliet. Tim is really shy and hates speaking. To get good marks himself, Matt knows that he has to encourage Tim to speak too. Can you spot the listening skills that Matt uses to help Tim? So who's your favourite character? (Long pause) So why's that then? (Tim shrugs his shoulders) Why do you like him better than say, one of the main characters, like Romeo? He's not so much of a show off. Do you mean he doesn't talk as much as Romeo? Yes. (Long pause) It's not just that. He's down to earth. Whereas Romeo is away with the fairies? (Laughs) Not exactly. A bit, I s'pose. I just meant that I like Benvolio because he's the only one that just tries to get by without getting into trouble. Matt has good listening skills - when Tim gives a one word answer, Matt prompts him by asking further questions and he engages with Tim."	5
Your teacher may ask you to have an argument so that he or she can test your speaking and listening skills. Of course winning an argument isn't just about being clever or talking loudly, look back at the Speaking Revision Bite to remind yourself how to be convincing during an argument or debate. Meat is murder! I love steak! That's terrible, even onions have feelings! Who cares? Peel the lot of them I say! I'll peel you before I see you peel another onion! Ah, but that would be murder! ...Oh yeah. Hurray! I've won! Put forward the most convincing points in a persuasive way. Listen carefully to what your opponent says and refer back to their points - this will show that you have been listening carefully.	5
Test your listening skills with this quiz. Note down your answer to the questions and then 'click ideas' below to see what kind of listener you are. 1. Your group is having an informal discussion about an issue in a book. No one can agree and everyone is talking at once. Do you: a) Shout the loudest to make sure that everyone hears what you have to say. b) Seize the opportunity for a nap - no one will notice as they're all too busy arguing. c) Suggest that you all take it in turns to speak whilst someone writes down everyone's ideas. 2. You've been asked to do a group presentation and there's a girl in the group who is really nervous. She starts to speak, but she suddenly goes silent and bright red. She's forgotten what else to say. Do you: a) Point at her and burst out laughing. b) Feel glad that everyone is staring at her and not you. c) Help her by asking her a question about what she's already said. 3. You've prepared an individual talk on your hobby for homework. Someone else in the class has just given their talk on exactly the same subject. Do you: a) Just read out what you had written in your notes. You weren't listening to the person who was just speaking, anyway. b) Screw up your notes and lock yourself in the toilet until the bell rings. c) Refer back to some of the things the other student said as you go along. 4. Your teacher puts you into pairs and asks you to improvise a missing scene from the play you've been reading. Do you: a) Say as much as you can to fill the two minute slot you've been given. It doesn't matter if it's irrelevant and it doesn't matter if your partner doesn't get a chance to speak. b) Allow your partner to do all the talking and keep your reactions to a minimum. c) Swallow your sense of panic, listen carefully to what your partner says and try and react accordingly, taking turns so that the improvisation makes sense and is balanced. What kind of listener are you? Me, me, me, me, me You are confident and outgoing. You might find yourself going out alone though if you don't try to listen to others more often. Introvert You probably are a good listener...but nobody knows it. Try to be brave and ask people questions during discussions. At least it will take the focus away from you, if that's what you want. Big ears You have excellent listening skills. Well done!	5

Q1. Which of these lines do you think are NOT written in English? But soft, what light through yonder window breaks? It ain't used it's new. The rain in Spain falls mainly on the plain. Q2. Which of these words are not English? A1. They are all written in English! A2. All of them are familiar English words, but originally they were borrowed from Indian languages. English is a language that is constantly changing and evolving. If it didn't, we'd still be speaking like Shakespeare! Language is influenced by many factors: Slang - each generation provides words known as 'slang' - often many of these words become accepted into mainstream English eg 'ok' and 'cool'. However, many slang terms lose popularity as a new generation emerges with their own slang words and phrases - making words such as 'phat' and 'groovy' history. Different cultures - the multi-cultural society we live in often provides new or adapted words. You might be familiar with the term 'avatar' in online communities but did you know the word is actually Hindi in origin? Has anyone ever said 'gesundheit' after you've sneezed? This is actually a German word, which has become popular in English. Colloquialisms - these are words or phrases that you only hear in a particular geographical area eg do you eat your sausage in a roll, bap or bun? Depending on where you live, it could be any of these. If you're Cornish, you might hear someone from Birmingham or Scotland using different words and grammar to you, even though you're all still speaking English. Benjamin Zephaniah is a poet who was born in Birmingham and spent much of his childhood in Jamaica. You can clearly hear these influences in his poems: Be nice to yu turkey dis Christmas Invite dem indoors fe sum greens Let dem eat cake an let dem partake, In a plate of organic grown beans You can listen to the poem in full here:	5
"Standard English is the style of English grammar, spelling and vocabulary that is widely accepted in spoken and written English. In formal speaking and listening situations, you will need to communicate using Standard English, eg when writing or giving a speech. The key to presenting the perfect speech is preparation and practice. World leaders don't just stand up and make up a speech on the spot - they carefully prepare beforehand. They even employ people to write their speeches, although remember, this is not an option at school! An effective speech needs to: Use the English language skilfully - as you have time to prepare your speech in advance, you can show off your English language skills and vocabulary. Be memorable - former prime minister Tony Blair was famous for making a speech that included the phrase ""Education, education, education"". This use of repetition made the speech memorable and helped his audience identify his key point. Make people think - you may have heard of Martin Luther King who repeated the phrase ""I have a dream"" when he campaigned for equal rights for black Americans. This was a speech designed to inspire and connect with his audience. I have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the colour of their skin but by the content of their character. I have a dream today! I have a dream that one day, down in Alabama, with its vicious racists, with its governor having his lips dripping with the words of interposition and nullification; one day right there in Alabama little black boys and little black girls will be able to join hands with little white boys and white girls as sisters and brothers. I have a dream today! Read the speech in full on the BBC News website. A good speech might contain the following: Here is an example of a speech to a group of students. Rollover the highlighted sections to see how the writer uses the techniques from the list above. Fellow students, have you ever felt afraid to walk around the school by yourself? 1 1 : Direct Address. The speaker is addressing the audience directly, asking them to think about their own experiences. In a recent survey carried out by the school council, 70 percent 2 2 : Evidence. This is an example of evidence to make the argument more convincing. of us have been bullied at some time in our life at school. The bullies arevicious, violent and vindictive 3 3 : Lists of three. A list of three words together sounds really powerful when it is said out loud. 4 4 : Emotive Language. These three words are examples of emotive language. . Unfortunately, they are getting away with it. Can this be fair? 5 5 : Rhetorical Questions. The audience aren't expected to give an answer, but the speaker wants them to think about what he is saying. We, the victims, are afraid of wearing the wrong trainers. We are afraid of being too smart or too stupid. We are afraid 6 6 : Repetition. It is effective to repeat the word 'afraid' in a speech about bullying. of anything that might draw attention to ourselves. The time has come for the fear to stop. The bullies terrify other students, and yet they are cowards 7 7 : Contrast. 'Coward' contrasts with 'terrify'. themselves. If we pull together we can fight this fear. Join me and fight this fear 8 8 : Another example of repetition! today."	5
"Writing the speech is only half the task - the next part is presenting it. The idea of presenting a speech might make you nervous but some people make speeches every day as part of their jobs. Think about your teachers - they regularly stand up before you and present to the class. You might notice that some teachers are more interesting to listen to than others. It is not necessarily what they say that keeps you interested, but often how they say it. What do your teachers do to keep your attention? Make a list then compare it with the tips below. Volume Your listeners will switch off if they can't hear you. Use a loud and clear voice, and if you're unsure if your audience can hear you at the back - just ask ""Can you hear me at the back?"" Pitch and tone If you speak like a robot, in the same boring tone, your audience will quickly drift off. Speak naturally and use the pitch of your voice to show your emotions. Facial expression You don't have to gurn at your audience! But if you don't look like you're interested in what you have to say, your audience won't be either. Gesture and movement Again, keep it natural, but if you stand like a statue, you won't be very interesting to watch or listen to. On the other hand, too much arm flapping and leg hopping will distract your audience from the point you're trying to make. Visual aids Use them, but use them effectively. They need to be big enough to see, interesting to look at and relevant to what you are talking about. Don't be tempted to make a big poster to hide behind! Vocabulary Choose words that are interesting, descriptive and appropriate to your audience. Don't baffle your audience with jargon or slang or lots of big words that are too difficult for anyone else to understand. Grammar If it's appropriate to your audience and task, try to use Standard English. You don't have to be too formal or put on a silly accent, just speak in a way that is easy for everyone to understand. Most people feel nervous about speaking formally in front of other people. Here are some tips to help you conquer your nerves: Write your speech out in full and read it several times - this will help you gain confidence in the content. Prepare small cards with key points of your speech. By now you should be familiar with your speech so these points will help you keep to your structure. Avoid the temptation to read your speech in full - the idea is to test your speaking skills, not your reading skills! Practice your performance before the real thing. Try practicing at home on your own, and then in front of family or friends. If you have visual aids, be sure to practice using them. On the day, take a deep breath, smile and try to enjoy it."	5
Presentations are sometimes less formal than speeches, and you'll probably be asked to present in groups rather than on your own. Use the tips on the previous page to make your performance strong. Here are some extra tips for group presentations: Organise the presentation fairly between each group member - ensure that everyone gets their chance to present. If you're shy, don't hide behind your group - you need to take part too! A group presention needs to come across as a team effort - be careful not to allow over enthusiastic members to dominate. Work together - if one person is speaking, another person can point to relevant visual aids. You may be asked to find a poem or an extract from a story to read aloud to your class. Here are some tips to help you with reading aloud: If you can choose a text you are familiar with this will probably boost your confidence. Practise your reading using gestures and movement, and don't be tempted to hide behind your book. Try to look up from your reading several times and make eye contact with your audience. Vary your pitch and tone and make it relevant to your subject matter. If you're reading something spooky, try to reflect this in your voice. If you're reading a conversation between two characters, attempt to distinguish their voices. Think about volume and pace - ensure that your audience can hear you clearly.	5
A debate is an organised argument. You might think you've never taken part in a debate before but you probably have without realising it! When you discuss topics in class or at home, and put forward different points of view - this is debating. Debating allows you to discuss your ideas and find out what other people think about a particular topic. If you're asked to take part in an organised debate at school, this is likely to be a more formal discussion and follow a set of rules. Here are some simple rules for formal debates: First of all, you need two teams: the proposition team and the opposition team. Then you need something to argue about. This is called a motion. The proposition team starts. Their first speaker has to tell everyone what the motion is all about. The opposition team goes next. Then the teams take it in turns until everyone has had their say. The last speaker on each team has to sum up their team's main argument. Your team will need to do plenty of preparation - writing out the main points of your argument. During the debate, your team is allowed to pass notes to each other so that you can add or change things as you go along. The most convincing team wins the debate. Try to guess in advance what your opposing team might argue to avoid being caught out. Use these tips to make your arguments as convincing as you can: Use facts - it's hard to argue against a fact so use as much evidence and as many statistics as possible. Use opinion too - debating is all about getting your opinion across and persuading others to agree with you, so use a good balance of fact and opinion. Listen to the other team and comment on what they have said. You then have a chance to convince the audience of the other side of the argument. Structure your argument - as if you were writing an essay, you need a clear introduction, a middle and a conclusion. Arguing isn't about shouting the loudest - present your arguments in a clear controlled voice. Don't lose your temper or get too emotional about the arguments.	5
Are you a chatterbox or a master speaker? Note down your answer to these questions and then 'click ideas' below to see what kind of speaker you are. 1. Your group is giving a presentation on a character in the book you've been reading as a class. Do you: a) Make it up as you go along, forget what you've already said and start to laugh. b) Spend all your time making a massive poster of the character. c) Plan what you're going to say, and speak loudly and clearly, even though you feel nervous. 2. Your teacher asks you to read aloud in class. Do you: a) Read the extract really quickly to get it done as soon as possible. b) Read the extract and look up at the end when you've finished. c) Read the extract in a slow and clear manner using emotion and pauses where appropriate. 3. You've written a really good speech and the time has come for you to present it to the class. Do you: a) Wonder, at the last minute, if you look a bit of a geek, and read out the speech as if it was your granny's shopping list. b) Hide in the toilet and hope that you'll get good marks for writing the speech even if you don't present it. c) Try to act out the speech as if it were a piece of drama. You feel a bit nervous, but you want people to know how passionate you are about the subject. 4. During informal class discussions, you usually: a) Talk as much as possible. Sometimes, even when other people are talking. b) Keep quiet and let others do the talking. c) Think about what you want to say before you speak, having listened to other people's ideas. 5. In a class debate, you are put on the team that opposes the motion, 'Meat is Murder', but you are a vegetarian! Do you: a) Read out the speech that your team has helped you prepare, but lose interest for the rest of the debate. b) Refuse to take part and say nothing. c) Use your knowledge as a vegetarian to guess what the proposing team's points might be, so that you can help your team to knock those arguments down and win the debate. What kind of speaker are you? Chatterbox You probably are a good speaker, but you haven't polished your skills yet. Deep down, you'd like people to take you seriously. Well, here's your chance! Speak no Evil You hate speaking and listening assessments and think you're going to die every time the teacher says you've got to do one. What you need to remember is that everyone feels just as nervous as you do. They're all just better at pretending. Master Speaker You are a great speaker. It's not easy, but you take part and overcome your nerves	5

Writing to analyse, review and comment are quite similar to writing to argue, persuade and advise because they examine the main aspects of an issue, make points about the findings, provide evidence to support these points and reach a conclusion. This Revision Bite covers:	5
When you are writing to analyse, you need to remain objective, detached, balanced, fair and avoid just giving your own opinions in your conclusion. An analysis: Investigates an issue or text's key points Unlike a review, it's not solely focused on pros and cons or good and bad Reviewing is more subjective and personal. Personal knowledge and authority will make your conclusions count. However, you will still need to support your points with valid reasons. A review Draws a conclusion, saying whether something works for its audience and purpose A comment gives purely subjective and personal views on a topic. If you're asked to give one in class, you should still be authoritative providing support for your views. A comment: Uses the first person narrator â€“ I think, In my opinion, I really like thisâ€¦ Although other comments may not, you should support your ideas with evidence when you comment in class.	5
When you are writing to analyse you tend to be quite distant - don't show your personal opinions and be detached from the conclusions you reach. Here is a typical question: Some students feel that there is still too much unhealthy junk food in school. They want more healthy dishes. Others say they wouldn't eat the healthy food and would just bring in their own food or go out to the chip shop, which is out of bounds. We need a solution! Write a speech, to be given at a School Governors' meeting, analysing the advantages and disadvantages of making school dinners healthier. You have to forget about your own preferences. Be thoughtful and give a balanced view of the problem. You could start with ideas like these: You must also come to a reasonable conclusion. Remember, it has to be a formal speech, that can provide a solution which will solve the problem.	5
"This is one version of the speech. You will find comments beneath each paragraph, explaining what the writer has done well. I'm sure you've all heard the saying ""we are what we eat"". Have you been into the school canteen recently? The selection is similar to that in many schools: a main meal which is usually meat-based, a variety of burgers and pizzas, a dessert and, for the health-conscious, jacket potatoes with one or two cold fillings. The question we are here to consider today is whether this is a reasonable selection, or whether changes could be made in Grange High School's canteen. The speech begins dealing with the problem straight away. It starts with a short, familiar phrase and a rhetorical question, to involve the audience and make them listen to the speech. The current selection of food is outlined to set the scene, followed by the main question to be tackled. The opening is very friendly and easy to follow. This is a great start. A survey conducted recently by Year 9 students suggested that many students are happy with the food on offer. They stated that the burgers and pizzas were their favourite food and that they were ""tasty, filling, cheap and quick"". These choices, sometimes called ""junk food"", are the best sellers and the canteen staff say the profit from these makes it possible to offer some of the less popular options. The writer now looks at the evidence for keeping junk food. They've imagined a survey and comments from the canteen staff - this is fine as it's relevant and makes sense. Some students admit that the junk food in the canteen is the only reason they stay in school at lunchtimes. Although we are not allowed off site during school times, it is well known that some students do sneak out to local chip shops and other takeaways. A substantial number of students who took part in the canteen's survey said they would be more likely to do this if the canteen offered more healthy food. The final argument for junk food is explained. The writer introduces a rather controversial point, but softens it with the phrase 'it is well known...' so that no one is blamed. Again this keeps things formal and balanced. So far, the writing looks really good, but it seems like the conclusion will be in favour of junk food. Is there any way of balancing the argument? Go to the next page to see how this is done."	5
The second half of the writing focuses on the points in favour of the healthier options. Again, if you want any further information, click the check ideas button to see our comments. However, this evidence does not show the whole picture. Many students say they would prefer to see more choice in the canteen. They point out that eating jacket potatoes every day is boring, and that the cold fillings are inadequate in winter. It has been suggested that more sandwiches, salads and a bigger range of hot main meals would be much more appealing. Many of these students currently bring their own food to school simply because they feel there is so little choice. These numbers include Grange High's many vegetarians. Now the writer moves on to the views in favour of healthy food. The impersonal tone is maintained in the first sentence. The formal connective 'However' is used to signal a change in the argument. The writer returns to the facts - jacket potatoes are the only healthy option - and suggests some alternatives. She builds on the evidence mentioned earlier. She is building up towards her conclusion now. Nevertheless, it remains true that junk food is popular and easy to produce. If students start going off site they may get injured or into trouble, and the school could be held responsible. Therefore, it seems impractical to ban junk food altogether. But is there another answer? I believe there is: the canteen could offer a wider selection, including healthier options, for one term, and see whether it is successful. If it is, and we see more students using the canteen and eating the healthy options, the canteen could make this change permanent. This detailed paragraph begins to suggest the solution. Formal connectives are used ('nevertheless' and 'therefore') to signal that the argument is coming to an end. She returns to a personal expression, 'I believe there is...' because she is summing up her findings. In conclusion, the solution seems clear: if a good selection of food is provided then everyone will be happy - and the canteen will almost certainly gain more customers. Thank you for your time. The final paragraph is short and direct. It sums up the main conclusion of the speech in a positive way: 'everyone will be happy' and 'the canteen will almost certainly gain...' which leaves the audience with a clear picture of her final point of view. Rather than trying to persuade people one way or the other, the speech has tried to suggest a solution where everyone gains. This isn't always possible, but it can be a helpful way of concluding without sitting on the fence and telling the audience to make up their own minds. As you can probably guess, this is an excellent answer.	5
"You should have spotted that the second sentence uses the detached, impersonal tone. The phrase ""it is often argued"" is a useful one. Here are a few more: It seems likely that... Some argue that... It is sometimes stated that... There is evidence to suggest... We frequently hear... You can also use words like these: could... might... can... if... perhaps... maybe... some... Now, try to rewrite the sentences below so that they are fairer, more reasonable and detached. You can use some of the phrases and words above, and you can add your own details too - but try to keep the basic idea without losing your objectivity. Fast food is bad for our health and should carry health warnings. Children nowadays don't walk enough and it's making them all overweight. Manchester United is the best football club in the world. I hate the smell of cigarette smoke - smoking should be banned in public places. Beaches are the best places to go on holiday. Miami is a waste of time in the winter. Four-wheel drive cars are the only way to travel - they are brilliant! Learning French at school is a waste of time because you'll never get to use it properly. Writing to analyse isn't difficult, but it needs practice and thought."	5
1. This is an extract from the Anthony Shea Community School newsletter: Dear Parents/Guardians, During the past three years, mobile phones have become more and more popular. Growing numbers of our students bring them to school, and parents encourage this as they can stay in touch with their children and know they are safe. However, many of our students keep their phone on during the day which can disturb lessons. A number of phone thefts have also occurred recently, both in and out of school. I would like to call a meeting to discuss this issue with staff, parents and students. I don't want to ban them, but we must agree on how they can be used sensibly and safely. Write a speech to be given at this meeting analysing the advantages and disadvantages of allowing mobiles in school and suggest how they can be used sensibly and safely. 2. Read this extract, which considers the issue of horror movies: As a parent, I have constant battles over TV and films. My children feel they should be allowed to watch whatever they want, no matter how violent, gory or creepy. They say it's just entertainment, and that it has no effect on them. I don't agree! Many of the films are rated 18, and my oldest is 14. I'm afraid my kids will become more aggressive and uncaring towards people, or that they might end up seeing something which really disturbs them. Write an article for your school magazine commenting on why horror movies are popular with teenagers and explaining the advantages and disadvantages of parents banning them at home.	5
How do techniques change for arguing, persuading and advising? Have a look here to get an idea.	5
When writing to argue, persuade and advise, you are offering ideas to other people. However, each style does this in different ways. If you argue, the writing tends to look at both sides and come to a conclusion. If you persuade, it tends to be one-sided, making your ideas the only sensible choice. If you advise, it tends to be softer, guiding someone towards your ideas. This Revision Bite covers:	5
"The key thing about writing an argument is that you present both sides and come to a clear conclusion. It's not like arguing with one of your friends, when you just say what you think. Instead, when you write an argument you have to show you are reasonable and can consider the different sides. The following article has appeared in your local paper: Park or car park? Ashfield Park is threatened with closure next month as a local business has applied for planning permission to turn the area into a car park. Local residents have begun a fierce campaign to save the park, which is a popular walking spot for young children and the elderly, as well as home to the War Memorial and many wildlife species. Write to your local paper, arguing that the park should be preserved. It would not be enough to write that you want the park to be saved - it might be how you feel, but it wouldn't be an argument.. It wouldn't even be enough if you wrote about all the good things in the park. That would be persuading as you haven't thought about any other views. A good argument presents both the good and bad aspects of keeping the park. For instance, the park might protect nature, but cost a lot to keep clean. It might be a good place to walk, but few people actually go there. An argument depends on bringing these ideas together. Use connectives, like ""because"" or ""however"" or ""although"". These words give your argument a logical structure and help make the contrasts clear. Once you have worked through these ideas, you come to your conclusion - saying whether they should keep the park or not."	5
"When you are persuading people, you usually use a different style. You don't need to show both sides - all you have to do is present your ideas. For instance, imagine you had to persuade people to buy a certain toothpaste. You could write about the great taste, or how clean your teeth feel or how white they are. It doesn't really matter what you find to write about as long as you get them to buy it. But you wouldn't write about other makes of toothpaste. You don't persuade like this, because it sounds like you aren't sure. So the first thing to remember is: Be definite - if you are writing about how great chips are, keep repeating the idea. Convince yourself how good they are - they might even be a healthy option, because lots of doctors are bound to like them and chips wouldn't be so popular if they weren't really great, would they? Once you have convinced yourself, it's much easier to convince others. So next you need to remember to... Be positive - it's always better to hear how good your idea is rather than how bad other people's are. So write about the things that show your ideas in the best light. For instance, aren't chips just great for a quick snack? Why were chips voted the most popular option in our school at lunchtime? And finally don't be frightened to... Be pushy - If you don't seem too sure, or if you can't make your ideas stand out, then you aren't really persuading as much as you can. And if that is the case, you need The Persuaders' Toolkit. Repeat yourself - don't worry about saying the same thing again and again - people forget, so repeat yourself and they will remember. Even when you think they might remember, you can always repeat yourself another time. Be personal - using words such as ""we"" or ""I"" always sounds a lot more convincing. We all know that, don't we? Use questions - why would you use questions? Well, they make people think. They also get your readers involved in what you are writing. So will you use them when you persuade? If not, why not? Use feelings to push ideas - words are your ammunition. In seconds, they can make your friends laugh, or your teacher angry, so why not use them properly to persuade your readers? For instance, don't just write ""the pressure of doing school work"", because there is no real feeling there. Instead, how about: ""the endless trauma, the desperation and the mindless suffering that school work inflicts on students""."	5
"Once you can argue and persuade, it should be easy to advise. The trick is to be gentle - it's no good pushing your ideas at your readers, or trying to impress them. Instead, you should come across as friendly, as someone who just wants to help. For instance, imagine you're writing to advise someone in Year 9 who is moving house and has to change schools. We know that it won't be easy - they'll have to make new friends and cope with all sorts of changes. So you need to be sympathetic and give some ideas you think could help. The first thing might be to plan each main idea in a separate paragraph because it's easier to follow like this. Then think about how you want to present your ideas. It might be fine to give some information as an order, such as: If you're not sure what to do on the first day, ask someone. You can add information to this - perhaps explaining why and giving an example of what to do, so now your paragraph looks like this: If you're not sure what to do on the first day, ask someone. Most people will be glad to help and it's the quickest way to make friends. You can ask a teacher, but it might be better to ask one of the other pupils. Choose a friendly face if you can, and don't be shy - it might be their first day too. It is not just the information that makes this a good piece of advice, it's also the style. It includes words like ""might"" and ""can"". These make the ideas softer - they are not in your face and pushing you to agree, they just guide you. And they are very simple to use, so make sure you include words like ""should, can, could, might, ought to and may"" - each one turns an idea into a piece of advice."	5
Are you trying to write creatively? We have some tips that could help.	5
This topic is all about creative writing and producing something that is different and new. So you need to be original. You need to use language in a far more personal way and use your imagination. This Revision Bite covers: Short-stories	5
There's no formula for having a brilliant idea. What you really need is an idea to start with. Then you need to make this idea a little different. This is the creative part, taking something that appears very ordinary and turning it into something unusual. For example, you may be asked to write a description of a coastline. You might start to think straight away about a crowded beach - children playing, deck chairs, sun shining, happy sounds. But if you stop for a moment, you realise that's been done before. It's OK, but it's not very creative. What about turning that on its head - not crowded, but deserted? Not summer, but winter? Not lovely and inviting, but covered in oil and polluted? It's not a pretty picture, but it's original - and that gives impact.	5
One way of being creative is appealing to the senses. Let's go back to our description of a coastline. Imagine you want to write about a cliff, concentrating on the sense of sound, sight, touch, taste and smell. Sound - the waves crashed on the rocks beneath and I heard the gulls screaming above me. Sight - the heavy, grey rocks looked as if they were about to slide into the leaden sea. Touch -the wind lifted my hair and I felt sudden gusts sting my face. Taste - the spray from the waves hit my face and I could taste the salty water on my lips. Smell - the damp, warm scent of the seaweed rose gently. Now, see if you can use the same list of senses to describe another sea scene. This time, describe a sunny beach. You don't have to tell a story, just make your description come alive and imagine that you really are there. Once you've written it, compare your ideas to ours on the next page...	5
A sunny beach gives you all sorts of possibilities to use your senses. For instance: The shouts of excited children mingled with the screams of seagulls and the soft roar of breakers on the sandy beach [sound]. I looked down the beach towards the blue sea criss-crossed by the white triangles of sails [sight]. The hot sun burned down onto my back and neck [touch], and the air was heavy with the smells of suntan oil, sea salt and ice cream [smell]. I could taste the vinegary tang of chips even before I found the busy fish and chip shop [taste]. You don't want to overdo the senses, but they are a useful way of making your writing more interesting. Another way of doing this is to look for more original words and phrases to write something that is fresh, not stale. How could you improve the following sentences? 1) He was scared out of his skin. 2) The trees danced in the breeze. 3) She felt that her heart would break. 1) He felt his fingers uncontrollably tighten and clench together so that his nails dug deep into his palms. 2)The wind gradually got stronger and they could see the leaves on the top branches swirling rhythmically, rising and falling. 3) She knew that she wouldn't be able to speak or even look at him, and she kept blinking back the tears. Hopefully, you'll find these second versions more accurate, creative and involving. So write down exactly what you see in your head when you imagine the scene. Don't take short cuts!	5
"A short-story is easy to write if you: Have only one or two main characters. It's a short story and you don't have time for any more. Use people's words and actions as much as possible. Don't try to give lots of background information - let the reader use their own imagination. Remember - creative writing means creative reading too! Make your characters and plot realistic. How do people really speak and act? Remember, most writers base some of their characters on people they actually know, so who can you use to improve your story? Would your granny make a good secret agent or your uncle a confident contract killer? Get straight to the point. Don't worry about long openings or lots of detail. Instead, launch right in, hopefully in the middle of some action, like in the example below. Steve held on to the tuft of grass and slowly looked down - he was too shocked to speak. One moment he had been strolling along the cliff with Vicki, the next he was hanging over the edge. And where was Vicki? You will also have to decide whether to write in the first person (using ""I""), or in the third person (typically, using ""he"", ""she"" and ""they""). Using ""I"" makes it easier to write about thoughts and feelings, but using ""he"", ""she"" and ""they"" lets you move from person to person, or from place to place. You can choose whichever you feel happiest with. For instance, we can swap the opening of the story into the first person, like this: I held on to the tuft of grass and slowly looked down - I was too shocked to speak. One moment I had been strolling along the cliff with Vicki, the next I was hanging over the edge. And where was Vicki? The only thing you shouldn't do is swap the person - donâ€™t start with ""I"" and then switch to ""he"", or you'll spoil the story."	5
The other problem some writers have is ending the story. It doesn't matter if it's a happy ending or not, but it has to make sense. There are lots of ways of ending, such as: The cliff hanger, where we have to wait until the final moment until we know. For instance, the spy who manages to stop the bomb two seconds before it explodes. The twist, where we are fairly sure about something, but in the final part everything changes. For example, we then learn that this is a fake bomb, and the real one is hidden somewhere else and will explode in five minutes. The unfinished ending, where the story stops, but we aren't sure what has actually happened at the end. For instance, the bomb is defused and everyone is safe. But then an army commander reports the theft of another bomb... only this time twice as powerful. However, there are two endings to avoid: The trick ending, where a bomb will inevitably explode and as it does, the narrator wakes up - it was all a dream. Some English teachers don't mind this sort of thing, but others hate it. You have been warned. The disconnected ending, where the secret agent suddenly stops worrying about the bomb, retires, and goes off to play golf. This is even worse, and no-one likes it because the ending has nothing to do with the story. Whatever kind of story you write, decide on your ending and include it in your plan. Writing that explores, imagines or entertains depends on being creative. You need to experiment a little and not be frightened to try something new.	5
One way to improve your style is to look for more interesting words. What alternative words can you think of for those in bold? Make a note of them and then compare your answers with ours. I enjoyed my holiday in Corfu because the weather was good. I had a nice time at the zoo. The roller coaster went into the first bend. Our Spanish visitors, Veronica and Inigo, were tired after the trip. She ate the hamburger. Make a note of words and phrases you could use to write about a playground. Make a note of words and phrases you could use to describe a countryside scene in winter.	5
When do you need to use formal or informal writing? Try to work it out here.	5
"This Revision Bite will show you how to adapt your writing to make it more formal and how to use informal language in your writing. But first, you will learn about the writerâ€™s voice and recap the TAP technique. This Revision Bite covers: The writer's ""voice"""	5
We all have different ways of expressing ourselves in our speech and in our writing. In writing, this is sometimes called voice. Good writers have a unique voice or style of writing. Here are two very different styles of writing: a) I suppose I could tell you all about where I was born, what it was like when Mum was still around, what happened when I was a little kid, all that kind of stuff, but it's not really relevant. b) My father's family name being Pirrip, and my Christian name Philip, my infant tongue could make of both names nothing longer or more explicit than Pip. Can you guess which line is from Charles Dickens's novel Great Expectations and which one is from Kevin Brooks's novel Martyn Pig? a) was written by Kevin Brooks b) was written by Charles Dickens Charles Dickens's voice is very different to Kevin Brooks's voice. But Kevin Brooks probably wouldn't write to his bank manager in the same voice that he uses to write his stories.	5
Sometimes you need to adapt your 'unique' voice to suit the: Q1. TAP the following sentences: a) Dis hw sucks man tho I am well ded if I hand it in l8. b) Dear Sir, Andrew experienced some difficulties in completing last nightâ€™s homework. Although he tried very hard, he was unable to understand what was expected of him. b) Text: letter Audience: teacher Purpose: explain Both pieces of writing give the same message: Andrew is having trouble with his homework. Would his teacher have taken the information seriously if he or she had received it as a text message? Would his friend have given him sympathy if they'd received the formal letter? When we write, we usually have a purpose. To achieve that purpose, we need to appeal to our audience. To do that, we have to choose the right tone of voice. (See the Tone and Style Revision Bite for more on tone of voice.)	5
Using formal language doesn't mean that you have to sound boring, you can still use words imaginatively in formal writing. News reports use formal language, but the words are rich and stimulating to keep the audience interested. Q1. The two sentences below both use formal language to give us the same information. Which sentence do you think is best and why? a) The bomb broke the windows of nearby buildings. b) The blast shattered the windows of nearby buildings. Q2. Which of the following should NOT use formal language? a) Advice to a close friend b) A letter to the local paper c) A speech to teachers or parents d) A newspaper article aimed at adults A1. Sentence b is better. Blast and shattered are far more descriptive than bomb and broke. A2. Example a) should not be written with formal language. You wouldnâ€™t use formal language when writing to a close friend. Make your writing clear and to the point. Try linking ideas with: In addition Nevertheless On the other hand By contrast Although Alternatively Include some complex sentences in your writing. Try using semi-colons if you feel confident about using them correctly. It's good to use figurative language if you think it fits in with the purpose and audience of the task. Metaphors and similes work well in speeches. Don't use 'Well' or 'You know' or 'Anyway' or 'Like I just said' or any phrase that sounds like you are having a friendly chat. Avoid using: 'And', 'But', 'Because' or 'So' at the beginning of a sentence. Keep exclamation marks to a minimum!! ! Words like 'nice' and 'a lot' have no power. Try to think of more descriptive words eg 'delicious' or 'endless'. ClichÃ©s are colourful phrases that people use all the time in speech. So often, in fact, that they seem worn out and boring in writing. Avoid phrases such as 'pretty as a picture', 'big as a house', 'skinny as a rake'.	5
"Writing is informal when it reads as though someone is chatting to the reader. In the right situation, it makes your writing seem more friendly and natural. Which of the following would you NOT write using informal language? a) A letter to a friend b) An essay about a Shakespeare play c) A talk aimed at students your own age or younger d) A diary entry e) A story written from the point of view of a character (in the first person) b) An essay should always be written using formal language. All of the other situations would suit a more informal style. 1. Address the reader directly: ""Dear reader, I'm really glad you've found the time to open this letter."" 2. It's okay sometimes to use the kind of words that are more usual in speech than writing: ""You don't have to put up with bullying. We'll stick together and make it stop."" 3. Contractions sound more natural in certain types of writing eg a talk to fellow students: ""It's good to know that we're all going to work together on this."" A word of caution, however! Don't baffle your reader with too much slang. Never swear. Think carefully about structure - informal writing is different to speech and needs carefully planned paragraphs to keep it clear and easy to read. Sometimes there is opportunity to break the rules of Standard English and use English in unexpected ways. Two good examples of writers who achieve this are poet Benjamin Zephaniah and writer Andrea Levy in her book Small Island. If you're asked to write a story, it would be a mistake for you as the author to use incorrect grammar and slang - but inside speech marks, your characters can!"	5
Here is a letter to a newspaper explaining why teenagers should be allowed to vote in the election. The ideas are good, but the writing is too informal. Rewrite the letter using formal language. Rollover the highlighted areas for tips. Hi there. 1 1 : 'Dear Sir', is a more formal way to begin a letter. Well 2 2 : This word needs to be deleted. It's far too chatty and informal. , I think that teenagers have just as much right to vote in an election as someone who's 3 3 : This should be written out in full: 'who is'. as old as the hills! 4 4 : This is a clichÃ© and sounds quite disrespectful. It would be better to just say elderly. The exclamation mark should be changed to a full stop too. They live in the country too, you know! 5 5 : 'You know' is too chatty. Delete it and the exclamation mark that follows. ! And 6 6 : 'In addition' would be a more formal way to begin this sentence. they're 7 7 : This should be wirtten out in full: 'they are' the future! 8 8 : Exclamation marks are too informal. So they're 9 9 : This should be written out in full: 'they are' bound to care about what's 10 10 : This should be written out in full: 'what is' going to happen to the country they live in when they're grown-up. But 11 11 : Avoid starting sentences with 'but' in formal writing. You could use 'on the other hand' to link the sentence to the previous idea. some people think that teenagers are away with the fairies 12 12 : This is a clichÃ©. 'Irresponsible' sounds more formal. when it comes to important things like voting. But 13 13 : Rather than 'but' you could use 'though' at the end of the sentence instead. not all of us are. And anyway you know some grown ups are like that too 14 14 : This sentence doesn't sound like a sensible argument. It starts with 'And' whilst 'anyway' and 'you know' are unnecessary. 'Like that' has no power and is unclear. 'Immature' might be a better word to use instead. . So 15 15 : 'In conclusion' is a more formal way to sum up an argument. I think teenagers should be given a chance. Cheers, 16 16 : Far too informal. 'Yours sincerely' or 'yours faithfully' is the usual way to end a formal letter Click 'Show ideas' to compare your ideas with ours. Teenagers have just as much right to vote in the election as adults. As citizens of this country, many of us care deeply about what happens to it. Some people think teenagers are too irresponsible to make the important decisions involved in voting but many of us are far more mature than most adults. In conclusion, we should be given a chance to prove ourselves as the mature and responsible young people we are. Yours sincerely,	5
Trying to work with facts? See how you can adapt your style for different readers.	5
Writing to inform, explain and describe are closely connected in the way they draw on facts and your own experience. This Revision Bite covers:	5
If you inform, the writing tends to stick to facts - things you know about and things that can be checked elsewhere. If you explain, the writing tends to be about facts and reasons, so you'd write about why or how something happened. If you describe, it's like taking a photo of something - you need information, but also lots of interesting details. You can include your own thoughts and feelings as well, because that helps convey information to your audience. So really, the ideas and topics you can write about are almost the same. It doesn't matter which of the three styles you are doing, you basically want to give information to your readers. What makes the difference is how you go about it.	5
"The key thing about writing to inform is that you stick to the information. You shouldn't really show many of your own feelings, and you definitely don't want to tell your audience how they should feel. Instead, when you inform you make the facts easy to understand, with a clear structure. Here is a sample ""inform"" question: Write an information leaflet for Year 6 pupils, telling them about the school day and what they need to know when they start your school in September. It's important to structure your answer well. Think of the answer in terms of a drawing, like this: This is a timeline - the arrow is time moving forwards and the four lines are different events in order. Now, you can think of the school day as the arrow, and plan the different events in a typical day. For instance, you could have registration, then an assembly, then two lessons followed by break. It should be easy to add information and detail. The structure also makes it easy for the Year 6 pupils to follow your information. Another way to inform is by subject, as in the diagram below: These are points linked together. It is not in order of time, but in order of subject. So you could have PE at the centre with all the information connected to PE in the little circles around. For instance, you could have different types of PE kit, the different sports, the sort of exercises you do. Once you have written about PE, you can move on to look at other areas of the school."	5
When you explain, you don't just write information - you also need to give reasons. In very basic terms you can think of the difference between informing and explaining in terms of answering a slightly different set of questions: Inform = What? When? Who? Where? Explain = What? When? Who? Where? How? Why? This difference is reflected in the question you will be asked, so our question about the leaflet might look a little different now: Write a leaflet for both the pupils and their parents, outlining some of the main features of school life in Year 7 and beyond. In particular, explain why pupils have several teachers each day and why the detention system is used. This is a little harder than the earlier version, but it's still about your school. Therefore, you still need lots of information about the classes, the organisation and the timetable. So you could still use our two basic approaches, timelines and topic centres, like this: However, you can also put these together, like this: Now, we can see a number of topics, so perhaps the three big circles represent registration, lesson times and detentions. They occur in that order each day, but the reasons for them are very different. So the smaller circles answer how and why as well as what, when and who. For instance, what are detentions? When do they take place? Who is in charge of them? How do pupils get put in detention? Why does the school use detentions? This approach gives your answer a very clear structure. The writing deals with a number of subjects in turn and each subject should be in its own paragraph. You can add details and explanations as you write out each paragraph. It makes it easier for you to write and easier for your audience to read or listen to.	5
When you describe, you need to give lots of detail and make the words interesting for others to read. For example, if you wanted to describe your home, you wouldn't just write lots of facts, like this: My house was built in 1972 of red brick with a pitched concrete tiled roof. The house was extended in 2003 with a small UPVC conservatory and an adjoining patio area of approximately 8 square metres... This gives lots of facts, but these are the types of facts that someone buying a house might need. Most people would find a description like this boring. So what should you do? The first thing is to think about what you want to show other people. Do you want to concentrate on the roof tiles or the types of bricks used? Or do you want to tell them about the fence panel your brother broke when he was chasing you last summer? You could also write about the time Stephanie threw a tennis ball and it got stuck in the guttering - it's still there - and when it rains really hard the gutter overflows. You might even have a gnome in the front garden, which your grandad bought - it looks stupid, but you won't move it in case you offend him. Each of these details is far more interesting than roof tiles or measurements. So, when you are describing something, think of drawing a picture or taking a photograph. You focus on a certain point, write a paragraph about it, then move to the next point and the next.	5
Another way to add detail to your descriptions is to use your senses. Think about what you can see, what you can touch, what you can smell, what you can taste and what you can hear. If we go back to your house, you might be able to add sounds, like music from your sister's room, the sound of the neighbour's lawnmower, or a baby crying upstairs. Here's a typical writing to describe question: Write a description of your school during a typical break. Include information about the buildings and the people. You might want to write about the classrooms, the hall, the playing fields and the corridors as well as the pupils and the staff. Why not have a go at planning an answer to this question now? You could have a go at writing a full answer, or just jot down some points and details on rough paper.	5
Write a description of your school during a typical break. Write about the classrooms, the hall, and outside as well as the pupils and the staff. There are lots of ways of answering this question - it depends on the type of school you go to and what you notice about it. However, a good answer would probably describe what was happening in different areas. Think what might be happening in each of these places, then click on the button to check your ideas. Remember, the answers are only suggestions - your school might be very different. One of the Year 7 pupils is near to tears and frantically looking for a bag they've lost. Their maths homework was due in today and they don't want a detention. The Spanish teacher writing a list of new words on the board ready for a lesson about shopping. A tired English teacher collecting a set of poetry books and dreading the next lesson with 10C - she's already got some detention slips laid out on her desk. A boy and girl from Year 11 chatting quietly in the corner of Music - they're usually here each break but shouldn't be inside really. Three Year 9 boys writing on one of the tables in History - they should definitely not be in the room. Groups from Year 7 playing games, like kicking a ball around or chasing after each other. Three girls from Year 8 arguing about a song. Two boys from Year 9 who are throwing their bags at each other and swearing quite loudly. Two teachers on duty: one's cold and looking a bit fed up. The other is drinking some coffee from a mug that looks like a flask. Both of them are ignoring the two boys who are throwing bags and swearing. Someone pushing into a queue for drinks - a couple of the Year 8's aren't too happy but they daren't say anything. The caretaker changing a bin - it was empty this morning but is now overflowing with all sorts of rubbish. He smiles as he sees a packet of Crunchy Monster Feet - no wonder they didn't want to finish it. Some of the Year 11 lads trying to act tough and showing off in front of some Year 10 girls. The girls say they aren't impressed, but they stay to find out a bit more. The new deputy head telling off Sam from Year 8 - Sam has never seen the man before and is being just a little too cheeky for the deputy's liking.	5
What do you need to remember to write well? Text, Audience and Purpose.	5
When preparing and planning your work, consider the text, audience and purpose. When you're checking it, look out for errors in spelling, punctuation and structure. This Revision Bite covers: Text, audience and purpose	5
Imagine you're writing a newspaper report about someone from who rescued a stray dog. You might wonder where to start? The easiest place to start is to make a plan. A simple plan for this story should include: 1. Facts about the rescue 2. Comments from other people 3. The future of the dog Organise the text below by dividing it up into facts, comments and future. This shows just how important the plan is - it shows you how to structure your answer. However, we still need to read the questions carefully, so let's take a further look at them.	5
When you're writing a piece for English, remember to TAP: Remembering to TAP will help you develop a plan. Text refers to the type of text you are being asked to write: letter, magazine article, story, etc. They all have particular features and you need to remember these to do well. For instance, if you write a letter, it shouldn't read like a Harry Potter story. Also, your English homework shouldn't be written like a text message. Audience is who you are writing for. This may be teenagers, adults or even children. It helps to put yourself in your audience's place - so for example, if you are writing a letter informing parents about a school trip, it is likely that parents will want to know about cost, safety and key facts such as times and places. Writing for adults doesn't necessarily mean you have to use long or complicated words - just ensure your writing is clear, sensible and interesting. Purpose refers to the point of the text and what it is aiming to do. Persuasive texts often encourage readers to buy something, or back a particular cause (eg charity) so they need to use informative and emotive language. Whereas an entertainment text is likely to be more light-hearted. You can use the TAP technique for all sorts of questions. The more you practise it, the better you'll get.	5
Use the TAP technique for the question below. It will help if you read the question through several times and slowly to digest the content. The following article has appeared in your local paper: Park or car park? Ashfield Park is threatened with closure next month as a local business has applied for planning permission to turn the area into a car park. Local residents have begun a fierce campaign to save the park, which is a popular walking spot for young children and the elderly, as well as home to the War Memorial and many wildlife species. Write to your local paper, arguing that the park should be preserved. Have a think - what is the TAP? When you have your answer, check it with ours by pressing the 'Check ideas' button. Text - a letter to a paper Audience - it's for local people Purpose - it's to argue and persuade. This means you want to influence other people and tell them what you think is right There are lots of ways of planning - some of them are fancy, some of them are simple, but the most important thing is to write your ideas down. If you don't, you could easily forget them. Let's have a go at using the question about the park. The simplest plan is just to write down a list of all the points. Look again at the question, think of a list, then compare yours to ours. Keep the park because: Has war memorial Great for children Ideal for dog walking Already too many car parks Don't want more noise and pollution Want to protect nature If you are writing an argument, and we are in this question, we can make two lists - one is the positive side - which supports your view, the other is the negative side - which goes against your view. Have a go, then compare your lists with ours. Has war memorial Great for children Ideal for dog walking Already too many car parks Don't want more noise and pollution Want to protect nature Use whichever way you find best, but don't forget that planning is something you can practise. You'll get quicker and make more detailed plans if you keep trying.	5
"It's important that you check the accuracy of your spelling in your written work. Here are some common errors to watch out for: Not dropping the final ""e"" before adding ""-ing"". Errors in forming plurals in words that end in ""-y"". Homophones (words that sound the same but are spelt differently and have different meanings), like ""to"", ""two"" and ""too"". Problems with two vowels in the middle of words, such as ea, ou and ie Problems with words that we sometimes shorten when we say them, like ""probly"" for ""probably"". Certain words could also cause trouble, so look for any ways of remembering them. Sometimes the oddest ideas are the easiest to remember, like Big Elephants Can Always Understand Small Elephants, which gives us 'because'. Here are a few more to help you: Separate - there is a rat in separate. Listen for the ear in hear. Here and there are all about place. You'll need 2 walking sticks if you fall off a wall. Rhythm Helps You To Hear Music."	5
"The most important thing with punctuation is to make sure your sentences are correctly marked at the start and end: One quick way to check is to read your work to yourself (it doesn't have to be aloud). If you 'run out of breath' or need to pause in your reading to add emphasis, ask yourself whether a comma or a full stop is needed. If so, put one in. Other areas which often cause problems are: If you have included the actual words that somebody speaks, make sure you put them inside speech marks. Remember to close the speech marks as well as open them! Always use question marks when writing a question whether it is direct or rhetorical. Look out for rhetorical questions in persuasive texts eg ""How long will it be until all our countryside is destroyed?"". Writers use rhetorical questions to emphasise a point and they do not expect the reader to genuinely answer the question. Be careful when using exclamation marks as overusing them can spoil a text. They should be used only to show excitement, surprise, shock or humour eg ""Stop the car!"" she yelled. These have two uses: To show when a letter has been missed out: he is - becomes - he's it is - becomes - it's they have - becomes - they've we would - becomes - we'd do not - becomes - don't you are - becomes - you're they are - becomes - they're To show ownership: my friend's house Dilip's car Sharon's boyfriend Remember: ask your teacher for some advice if you feel unsure about any aspect of punctuation."	5
How can you improve your writing? Learn more about layout here.	5
It's important to organise ideas and give your writing a strong structure. This means having a clear beginning, middle and ending and organising your paragraphs by TiPToP. This Revision Bite covers:	5
"The beginning, or opening, is one of the most important sections of your writing. It should grab the reader's attention and make them want to read on. For instance, which is the best beginning for a ghost story? a) The house was built in 1975. It was a typical semi-detached, but it did have quite an impressive front door. Most of the windows were double glazed and the garden was quite neat. b) The creaking door swung open to reveal an empty hall. Ben shivered as he stepped inside, his footsteps echoing on the cold tile floor. There are no prizes for guessing that the second one is scarier. Of course, if you were trying to describe the house and nothing else, then the first extract is better, because it tells us more. So you need to think about TAP (text, audience and purpose) and make a good start to your writing. You should try to 'set a context', which is like setting the scene. So if it's a speech, you might start by asking people a question and getting them to think. But if it's a newspaper article, you need to write what happened and where it happened very early on. a) The subject I am going to write about today is why the local park should not be closed. b) Have you ever stopped to wonder how many hundreds of people make regular use of our Memorial Park? a) It is unlikely that newspaper readers who enjoy all the things that our park has to offer will want it to disappear forever under tons of concrete. b) 'Ashfield Park will be ruined,' claim protestors who held a meeting last night to organise opposition to the council's plans for a car park. It should be clear that the ""b"" versions are better - they fit the style and show that the writer has used TAP to make their writing work. Remember - you need to make it interesting right from the start."	5
This is the heart of your piece - it contains the key points and will probably have three, four or five paragraphs. You should have one basic idea in each one, and the paragraph explains this, develops it and makes it relevant for your readers. So paragraphs are like stepping stones - they lead the reader from one end of your writing to the other. But when do you start a new paragraph? Well some people like using TiPToP, so let's see how this works. Ti - stands for Time, so start a new paragraph for a different time period. P - stands for Place, so start a new paragraph for each new place. To - stands for Topic, so start a new paragraph for each new topic, idea or subject. P - stands for Person, so start a new paragraph for each new speaker. Look at this sample question about the park and see if you can TiPToP it. Write an article for your local paper, arguing that the local park should be preserved. In this question, we are mainly dealing with ideas, so we need to concentrate on changes in topic. So where would you put the new paragraph in the following passage? Just click 'Check ideas' to see. The park is excellent for children. There is a small playground with a slide and swings, but there are also places where children can run around safely. In fact it's the best place in town to take children to because there is always something to do. The war memorial was first constructed in 1922, with the names of the people who died in the first world war. Since then other names have been added, from the Second World War and also from more recent times, such as Northern Ireland. We cannot just forget these people and we certainly cannot just destroy the memorial. It's important to use paragraphs, and to use them in the right places. So TiPToP it by using a new paragraph when... You are writing a story with speech and you change speaker. You are describing a number of different things. You move from writing details about something in the past and then a number of details about the present. In fact, TiPToP it when you change Time, Place, Topic or Person. There is no set length for a paragraph either. A short paragraph, sometimes just a line long, can be ideal and grab your attention.	5
This can be another tricky area - you shouldn't just stop writing. Instead, make the ending memorable. There are many different ways of doing this. If it's a ghost story, you can leave it unsure and open, as if something else might happen next. Like thisâ€¦ He turned away just as a shadow rose up from the bricks. Was it a trick of the light? Or something else? In other pieces, you need to come to a definite answer, like thisâ€¦ Once the trees are chopped down and the play equipment bulldozed away it will be too late. Too late to save our park. Too late to think about our children. And too late to remember those who died for our freedom. So act now to safeguard this valuable, beautiful area for the future. If you get it wrong, it can seem silly, like these examplesâ€¦ Once the trees are chopped down and the play equipment bulldozed away it will be too late. Act now to safeguard this valuable, beautiful area for the future. But remember that it could still be a car park, and create jobs for our community. Think about it - are you sure? I certainly don't know what to think. What's wrong? This person isn't sure what they want. So how can they convince anyone else? Once the trees are chopped down and the play equipment bulldozed away - well who knows, really. It's one of those things, and who can blame anyone. What's wrong? This argument has just fizzled away. There is no more detail. Make sure you don't waffle at the end.	5
Now you've had a chance to practise beginnings, middles, endings and paragraphs, you should have a clearer idea of how to organise your work. Remember: You need to organise and structure your work. It should be in clear, appropriate steps. If it's muddled, it will confuse the reader. Think about the beginning - will it interest other people? Will it make them sit up and take notice? TiPToP your paragraphs. That means a new paragraph for a new time, place, topic or person. The ending is not just when you stop writing - you need to make it memorable and as interesting as the start.	5
"1. You've just asked if you can go down to the park to meet your friends and have been given the following answer: ""You're not going anywhere near that place. It's full of litter, it's never supervised and the equipment is a total health hazard! You'll have to find somewhere else to hang around."" Write a letter to Mrs H Devonshire, Parks Department, complaining about the area and requesting that something is done about it. Below are five ideas for paragraphs that you could include in your letter. They are not in the best order, so drag and drop them to improve the structure. Drag the idea into the best place in the table below: Teenagers can frighten the children and no-one supervises them Say who I am / why I'm writing / where the place is"	5
What does TAP stand for? Find out why you need to know.	5
Tone and style is about how you relate to other people, and this is vital if you want to make a good impression. For example, get it wrong and it seems as if you're talking down to others, or making fun of them, or even being rude and aggressive. So how do you get it right? This Revision Bite covers:	5
When we speak, it's not usually a problem for us, but it's more difficult in writing. So let's start by testing your speaking skills using the Stylometer... Tone and style are about how you relate to others. So you need to think about your audience and write in the style they expect. Let's see where the following audiences would be on the Stylometer:	5
Your style needs to suit the task. For some tasks, you need to write quite formally, but in others you can make your writing less formal. However, you will not be asked to write in a very informal style and you shouldn't use slang, or a text messaging style in your writing. Read the examples carefully, then drag and drop them into the best place on the Stylometer:	5
"One quick way to improve your style is to avoid repeating words. Look for other choices. So instead of writing ""John was bullied"", you could change to ""picked on"" and instead of writing ""Satnam was the quickest runner"", you could alter this to ""the fastest"" or ""the best"" or ""the swiftest"" etc. You might not realise you have repeated a word, so look back over your writing to see what you can change. An examiner won't mind you altering something if it will improve it. Of course, it's fine to use the same word if you really want your readers to remember something. So if you are persuading them, you probably need to repeat your key ideas and key words."	5
Another top style tip is to avoid being boring. It sounds obvious, but many writers put in far too much information. In fact, some even write most of the question out again when they start their answer. So what should you do? At the beginning, don't waffle, get straight to the point. Don't just repeat things in your conclusion. Put yourself in the reader's shoes - which of these two starts to a school magazine article do you prefer? Do you know someone who is being bullied right now? Don't know what to do? Well we decided to send Stuart Smith (Year 8) around the school to find out just how bad bullying is, and to come up with some ideas about what we can do to stop it. Bullying is when people are cruel to other people. It can be hurting them, like kicking them, or hurting them using horrible names. It could be other things too. My article for the school magazine is about bullying. I am going to start by saying what the problem of bullying is and then... The first one is much better - it gets straight to the point and you want to read on. The second version repeats parts of the question, but for no reason. People who are reading the school magazine don't have to be reminded in each article that it is the school magazine. We also know the article is about bullying from the first sentence, but Stuart's definition is poor and the whole article is slow to get started.	5
Why are there different types of sentences? See what purpose they serve and why.	5
Different types of sentence suit different purposes. You should use a variety of sentences when you write. This Revision Bite covers:	5
Here's a brief outline of the different types of sentences (if you want more details, look at Sentences in the Reading Section). A simple sentence generally has one main verb and communicates one idea. For example: There can be several words in the verb, so It was raining. - has two words in the verb. Sean has been running. - has three words in the verb. However, in each example there is just one main verb and idea. This is the simplest type of sentence and usually it's very easy to understand. A compound sentence generally joins two simple sentences together. We typically use words like 'and', 'or' and 'but' to join the ideas. For example: It was cold but we still went to town. It was raining and we stayed indoors. This makes the two ideas equal in the sentence - if we take away one part of it, we are left with a simple sentence again. These are very common when we are speaking and they are not difficult to understand. A complex sentence communicates more than one idea, so it's like a compound sentence in a way. However, the ideas are not equal. This is because one part is like a simple sentence, so it can stand on its own. The other part can't - it needs something else to support it. For instance, look at this sentence: You can't persuade me to go to town, no matter how hard you try. We can take away the first part, but then we are left with: No matter how hard you try. Now this is not a simple sentence and it doesn't stand on its own - it needs something else to make sense. We use complex sentences a lot when we speak, but it's important to use them in our writing too. In fact, these are the most difficult sentences to get right.	5
What is wrong with this extract? The meeting starts at two. The meeting is in the usual room. The speaker is arriving at half past one. She will need an overhead projector for the meeting. Our overhead projector is broken. Get another one from Sally. John will start the meeting. You will introduce the speaker. The speaker is going to talk for about half an hour. You need to register any guests. Someone from staffing will do the displays. John will organise coffee and biscuits for afterwards. Answer the questions below: Q1. Each sentence is good on its own. Q2. Each sentence has something wrong with it. Q3. It has too many complex sentences. Q4. It has too many simple sentences. Q5. It repeats information. Q6. It doesn't repeat information enough. Q7. It doesn't flow. A1. Yes A2. No. They are all good sentences on their own. A3. No. There are no complex sentences here. A4. Yes, it needs changing. A5. Yes, using words like 'meeting' far too often. A6. No! Read it again. A7. Yes, that's the main problem with it. Now try to rewrite it by using compound and complex sentences. You might only need four sentences this time. Once you've done that, compare your answer with ours by clicking 'check ideas'. The meeting, which starts at two, is in the usual room, but the speaker is arriving at half past one. She will need an overhead projector so get one from Sally because ours is broken. John will start the meeting and you will introduce the speaker, who's going to talk for about half an hour. Someone from staffing will do the displays but you need to register any guests and John will organise coffee and biscuits for afterwards. Don't worry if yours isn't exactly the same. The main point is to join ideas together and make it interesting to read.	5
Another way to look at sentences is to think about their purposes. For instance, we can talk about... Statements, which tell us things. We tend to see these in school text books, in newspapers, or in an encyclopedia. For instance: Paris is the capital of France. Derby County play at Pride Park. This Revision Bite is all about sentences. Questions, which ask us things or make us think about things. For instance: What does TiPToP stand for? When did the First World War end? How much for a coffee? Orders, which are also called commands. These tell us what to do, so we find these in instructions, recipes and signs. For instance: Put your litter in the bin. Do not touch. Next, take a small pinch of salt and mix it all together. Exclamations, which are shouted out. You'd hear these at a football match, in arguments, or if you told a joke. For instance: Shut up! Goal! You don't have to know the names but you do need to know how and when to use them.	5
It's good to have a variety of sentences. You can have short ones, and then some long ones. But as we have already seen, if they are all simple sentences, then it gets boring and difficult to read. You should also use a mixture of questions and statements. Imagine giving some advice to a friend who is being bullied. You'd probably think of a few ideas very quickly: Tell your family about it. Do something about it. You could improve your work by adding other types of sentences. At the moment, it's just a list of orders. What about adding a question or two? Like this: Why don't you talk to someone at school about it? Do you know anyone else who is being bullied right now? This pushes your friend to think about something. It also gives them the opportunity to start talking about it. Then you could add a statement or two, like this: Bullying is more common than many people think. The worst thing about being bullied is feeling alone. If we combine these ideas and sentences, we have an interesting and varied piece of writing. All we need to add are some connectives, like 'and', 'but', 'so' or 'because'. Now we have writing that makes a real impact and which can offer advice as well as persuading people, like this: Do you know anyone else who is being bullied right now? Why don't you talk to someone at school about it? Because bullying is far more common than many people think. And it is far more serious than many people imagine. In fact, it is one of the main reasons for pupils missing school. But the worst thing about being bullied is feeling alone. So don't suffer in silence, tell your family about it and do something now.	5
"We can see why variety is important by looking at this list below. It is taken from a story called ""You are now entering the human heart"", by Janet Frame, and is actually one of her paragraphs broken down into simple sentences: Her eyes faced the lighted exit. I saw her fear. The children were sitting down. None of them had ever touched a live snake. They were hushed with fear. They were waiting for the drama to begin. One or two looked afraid. The attendant took a green snake out of a basket. It was about three feet long. He made a swift movement. He draped the snake around the teacher's neck. She did not have a chance to protest. He stepped back to admire the sight. He looked satisfied. It doesn't really sound right. How could the writer change this to convey the drama of the situation? Look again at the sentences and decide what changes you could make, which ones you could join. Then click here to compare your ideas with the version in the book. Her eyes faced the lighted exit. I saw her fear. The children, none of whom had ever touched a live snake, were sitting hushed, waiting for the drama to begin; one or two looked afraid, as the attendant withdrew a green snake about three feet long from the basket and with a swift movement, before the teacher could protest, draped it around her neck and stepped back, admiring and satisfied. So the key points to remember about sentences are: You should have a variety of sentences in each piece you write. Complex sentences cause the most problems, but they can be the best for linking ideas and arguing your point. Different types of sentence suit different purposes, so think carefully about what you are trying to do. Connectives are a good way of linking ideas. They can provide a more detailed structure and help readers."	5

Try to make sense of numbers here with information on calculations, equations, measurements and shapes. Calculations, orders of operation, fractions, decimals, and percentages Formulas, inequalities, equations, coordinates, graphs and sequences Recording and representing data, measures of average, probability and relative frequency Reading and converting measurement units, perimeter, area, volume and time Shapes, transformations, angles, triangles, lines, polygons, symmetry, circles, pythagoras' theorem	5
In this topic we cover the calculations and equations you need to understand graphs, coordinates and sequences.	5
Coordinates (x, y) are used to give positions on a graph. The x-axis is across, the y-axis is vertical. This Revision Bite covers:	5
All graphs have an x-axis and a y-axis. Here is a diagram of a typical set of axes. The point (0,0) is called the origin. The horizontal axis is the x-axis. The vertical axis is the y-axis The x-axis is horizontal, and the y-axis is vertical. One way to remember which axis is which is 'x is a cross so the x axis is across'. Coordinates are written as two numbers, separated by a comma and contained within round brackets. For example, (2, 3), (5, 7) and (4, 4) The first number refers to the x coordinate. The second number refers to the y coordinate. Coordinates are written alphabetically - so x comes before y (x, y). One way to remember is 'you go along the hallway before you go up the stairs'	5
When describing coordinates, always count from the origin. For example, to describe the position of point A, start at the origin and move two squares in the horizontal (x) direction. Then move three squares in the vertical (y) direction. The coordinates of point A are therefore (2, 3).	5
Try this question yourself before looking at the solution. Copy this grid onto squared paper.	5
Extending the x and y axes beyond the origin reveals the negative scales. The areas of the graph between axes are called quadrants. So now we have four quadrants in total. Coordinates in these quadrants are still described in terms of x and y. But now we can have negative values for x, y or both. For example in the diagram below: The coordinates of A are (-2, 3). The coordinates of B are (-3, -4). What are the coordinates of C for each of these examples? What is the coordinate of this point? Click next to find out	5
Fancy some detective work? Try to solve an equation.	5
This section looks at different types of equations, and some methods for solving them. This Revision Bite covers: What are equations? Solving more complex equations - ax + b = c	5
Equations are made up of two expressions on either side of an equals sign, like x + 2 = 1 To solve an equation, you need to find the values of the missing numbers. 'I think of a number, add four, and the answer is seven.' Written algebraically, this statement is 'x + 4 = 7', where 'x' represents the number you thought of. 'x + 4 = 7' is an example of an algebraic equation. 'x' represents an unknown number. The number you first thought of must be three (3 + 4 = 7). Therefore, x = 3 is the solution to the equation x + 4 = 7.	5
An equation is like a weighing scale - both sides should always be perfectly balanced. To solve the equation you need to find the value of missing numbers and perform the same operation to each side. For example, suppose you are trying to find out how many sweets are in the bag shown here. By subtracting three sweets from each side, the scales remain balanced. You can now see that one bag is equivalent to two sweets. Written algebraically, this is: x + 3 = 5 Subtract 3 from both sides, to give: x = 2 In this case, two bags of sweets are equivalent to six sweets: To find the equivalent of one bag, divide both sides in half: Written algebraically, this is: 2x = 6 Divide both sides by 2, to give: x = 3 Solve the equation: a) a - 3 = 4 b) 5b = 35 a) You need to add 3 to both sides. So, a = 7 b) You need to divide both sides by 5. So, b = 7 When solving algebraic equations, always check your answers. For example, if you think that the answer to the equation 'x + 5 = 12' is x = 7, then to check it replace x with 7. 7 + 5 does equal 12, so your answer is correct.	5
Sometimes an equation will have multiples of an unknown, eg, 5y = 20. To solve this you need to get the unknown on its own. To do this, divide both sides by 5. Sometimes an equation will have multiples of an unkown and other numbers, eg, 3x + 2 = 8 In equations of this type, your aim is to get all the 'x's (or unknowns) on one side and all the numbers on the other. Let's solve the equation 3x + 2 = 8. We can show this in a picture like this, where each bag is an 'x'. 3x + 2 = 8 We want to get the 'x' on it's own. Start by subtracting 2 from both sides: 3x + 2 - 2 = 8 - 2 3x = 6 Then divide by 3: So x = 2 Solve the equation 4x - 5 = 3 4x - 5 = 3 Add 5 to both sides to give: 4x = 8 Divide both sides by 4 to give: x = 2	5
Do you want to explore the unknown? Solve some equations.	5
An introduction to equations looked at balancing the equation, and at more complicated equations of the form ax + b = c. Make sure that you are confident with those methods before attempting this section. This Revision Bite covers:	5
You already know how to solve equations with the unknown (x) on one side of the equation. For example, the equation x + 3 = 5 is represented by the following diagram: By subtracting 3 sweets from both sides you will find the solution to the equation: You can now see that one bag is equivalent to two sweets. Written algebraically, this is: x + 3 = 5 Subtract 3 from both sides, to give: x = 2	5
The same rules apply if an equation has x on both sides. Keep the equation balanced and perform the same operation to both sides. Solve the equation 2x + 2 = x + 4 The equation 2x + 2 = x + 4 is represented by the following diagram: As usual, the bags represent the unknown (x) and the sweets represent the numbers. Aim to get unknowns on just one side of the equation, so begin by subtracting x from each side: Now you have the type of equation that you recognise, all you need to do is subtract 2 from both sides. Written algebraically, this becomes: 2x + 2 = x + 4 Subtract x from both sides to give x + 2 = 4 Subtract 2 from both sides to give x = 2	5
If the value of x is negative, tackle the equation in the same way - aim to get all xs on one side of the equation. Solve the equation 5x - 2 = 12 - 2x Your aim is to get all the unknown x terms on one of the equation side only, so start by adding 2x to both sides: 7x - 2 = 12 Next add 2 to both sides: 7x = 14 And finally, divide by 7 to give x = 2 As always, you can check your answer in the original equation. So substitute x = 2 back into 5x - 2 = 12 - 2x (5 Ã— 2) - 2 = 12 - (2 Ã— 2) 10 - 2 = 12 - 4 8 = 8 This makes sense, so the value x = 2 is correct. Solve the equation 4x = 10 - x Add x to both sides to give 5x = 10. To find x, divide both sides by 5 to get x = 2 Solve the equation 4x + 1 = 2x + 5 Start by subtracting 2x from both sides of the equation to give 2x + 1 = 5 Then subtract 1 from each side to give 2x = 4 Divide each side by 2 to give x = 2	5
To expand a bracket, multiply everything inside the bracket by the number outside. Expand this bracket: 2(3a + 5) Multiply everything inside the bracket by the number outside to give: 2 Ã— 3a + 2 Ã— 5 Simplify this to 6a + 10 Expand -3(2b - 4). Multiply everything inside the bracket by the number outside to give -3 Ã— 2b + -3 Ã— -4 Simplify this to -6b + 12 Solve the equation 3(5x - 4) = 2(2x + 5) First expand the brackets 15x - 12 = 4x + 10 Subtract 4x from both sides 11x - 12 = 10 Add 12 to both sides 11x = 22 Divide by 11 to give x = 2	5
To solve equations with fractions, you must do the same to each side of the equation to get the answer. For example look at the equation x/2 = 3 If we multiply both sides by 2 we get the answer: x = 6 Solve the equation 2x - 3 = 1/2 The number at the bottom is 2, so multiply both sides by 2. Remember you must multiply every term of both sides by 2, to give: 4x - 6 = 1 Add 6 to both side to give 4x = 7 Divide both sides by 4 to give x = 7/4 x = 1 3/4	5
If an equation has fractions on both sides, multiply both sides by the Lowest Common Multiple of the denominators. Solve this equation (x - 3)/2 = (x - 2)/3 One side is divided by 2. The other side is divided by 3. The Lowest Common Multiple of 2 and 3 is 6, so multiply both sides by 6. (x - 3)/2 Ã— 6 = (x - 2)/3 Ã— 6 3(x - 3) = 2(x - 2) Expand the brackets 3x - 9 = 2x - 4 Take 2x from both sides x - 9 = - 4 Add 9 to both sides x = 5	5
Want to create an algebraic expression? Have a go here.	5
In algebra, a letter can be used to represent a number that you do not know. This gives us algebraic terms, like 2x and 5y. When algebraic terms are put together by mathematical operations such as + and - we get an algebraic expression, like 2x + 5y +3z. We can simplify algebraic expressions by collecting 'like terms'. This Revision Bite covers:	5
If you are asked how many days there are in a week, you would find the answer easy - there are 7. How about the number of days in two weeks? Again, the answer is fairly straightforward - there are 14. What happens when you are asked how many days there are in three weeks, or four or five? If you know the formula you could work this out. 1 week is 1 Ã— 7 days = 7 2 weeks is 2 Ã— 7 days = 14 3 weeks is 3 Ã— 7 days = 21 4 weeks is 4 Ã— 7 days = 28 So, the formula to work out the number of days is: number of days = number of weeks Ã— 7 Q1. How many pence are there in Â£1? Q2. How many pence are there in Â£2? Q3. How many pence are there in Â£7? Q4. What is the formula connecting the number of pence to the number of pounds? A1. 100p = Â£1 A2. 200p = Â£2 A3. 700p = Â£7 A4. pence = pounds Ã— 100	5
In algebra, letters are used when numbers are not known. Algebraic terms, like 2s or 8y, leave the multiplication signs out. So rather than '2 Ã— s', write 2s, rather than '8 Ã— y' write 8y. A string of numbers and letters joined together by mathematical operations such as + and - is called an algebraic expression. r + 2s means an unknown number 'r', plus 2 lots of an unknown number 's'. Q1. Say that 'g' is the cost of child admission, and 'k' is the cost of adult admission to the zoo. a) How much does it cost for the Khan family of 3 children and 3 adults to visit the zoo? b) Write an algebraic expression for the cost for the Norman family of 5 children and 4 adults to visit the zoo. a) Cost for 3 children = 3g Cost for 3 adults = 3k Total cost = 3g + 3k b) 5g + 4k	5
Algebraic terms that have the same letter are called like terms. Only like terms can be added or subtracted. So 9b, -7b and 13b are like terms, but 6t, 5x and -11z are not like terms. When like terms are added and subtracted it is called simplifying. The Khan family and the Norman family visit the zoo together - there are 8 children and 7 adults in the group. Because there are more than 10 people, the families can take advantage of a special offer - 1 child can be admitted free of charge. As before let's use g for the cost of child admission, and k for the cost of adult admission. Cost for the Khan family = 3g + 3k Cost for the Norman family = 5g + 4k Offer = - g Total cost = 3g + 3k + 5g + 4k - g Simplified = 3g + 5g - g + 3k + 4k = 7g + 7k A term, like a number, belongs with the sign that sits in front of it. So in the expression 2k - g, g belongs with the - sign that sits in front of it, so it is - g; and 2k belongs with the + sign that sits in front of it, making it + 2k. Remember: Re-write the expression by putting the like terms next to each other. remember to keep the plus or minus signs with the terms they belong to. 4x + y - 2x + 6y = 4x - 2x + y + 6y Simplify this to get: 2x + 7y.	5
The advert says that the cost of a party is Â£50 plus Â£5 per person, so what would be the cost of a party for 10? The cost would be 50 + 10 Ã— 5 = 50 + 50 = Â£100 What would be the cost of a party for 20? How do you work out the cost if you don't know the number of people who will attend the party? With this formula you can work out the cost of a party for any number of people. Have a go at the next question to see if you can use n in another expression. Alexa is 12 years old. How old will she be in n years time? In n years time her age will have increased by n. So her age will be n more than it is now. Her age will be 12 + n Check your answer. In 1 years time she will be 13. If we put 1 in for the value of n we get 12 +1 = 13. So that is correct. In ten years she will be 22, and putting n=10 gives us age = 12 + 10 = 22 So the formula is correct.	5
How can you work out temperature and time zones? With formulas.	5
This section expands on the work covered in An introduction to formulas. This Revision Bite covers:	5
From An introduction to formulas, remember that any term that contained the same letter can be combined by adding and subtracting. So, 3g + 2k + 5g + 4k - g = 3g + 5g - g + 2k + 4k = 7g + 6k Like terms with powers can be added or subtracted but only if the powers are the same. x is not the same as x2, so they cannot be added together. Simplify: 3x + 5 + x2 - 2x + 2x2 - 1 Rearrange the expression so that like terms are next to each other: x2 + 2x2 + 3x - 2x + 5 - 1 And then simplify: 3x2 + x + 4 People usually write the expression with the 'x2' term first, then the 'x' term and finally the number term. Simplify: 5 + 4x2 - 3 + 2x + x2 - 4x To get the answer, rearrange the expression: 4x2 + x2 + 2x - 4x + 5 - 3 and then simplify. 5x2 - 2x + 2	5
Algebraic expressions can be multiplied in the same way as numbers. Remember that 2a is not the same as a2 2a = 2 Ã— a a2 = a Ã— a Simplify: Remember that x is the same as x1 when using this rule. eg, n3 Ã— n = n(3 + 1) = n4 Multiply letters and the numbers separately: 2 Ã— 3a means 2 Ã— 3 Ã— a which is 6a 4a Ã— 5a means 4 Ã— a Ã— 5 Ã— a which is 4 Ã— 5 Ã— a Ã— a = 20a2 = 6p3	5
When multiplying expressions in brackets, make sure that everything inside the bracket is multiplied by the term (or number) outside the bracket. Expand 2(3x + 4) What is 2(3x + 4)? What is 2(3x + 4)? Use either method, but remember that everything inside the bracket must be multiplied by the term (or number) outside the bracket. What happens when we have more than a single term or number outside the bracket? What happens when we have another bracket. For example, if we want to expand (a + b)(c + d), we need to make sure that everything in the second bracket is multiplied by everything in the first. We can do this in two ways, using boxes or lines. Method 1 - Boxes Method 2 - Lines You can choose either method, boxes or lines, but make sure that you multiply everything. Remember, too, that a '+' or '-' symbol belongs to the number or term immediately after it. Expand (x - 3)(x + 2) Play this animation to see both methods, boxes and lines.	5
When letters in a formula are replaced by numbers, it is called substitution. For the purpose of measuring time, the Earth's surface is divided into 24 equal wedges of 15Â°, each called time zones and beginning at Greenwich, London (GMT). As you pass over each zone to the east you add 1 hour to GMT, and as you pass over each zone to the west you subtract 1 hour from GMT. On this basis, call the time in London 'g'. The formula for working out the time in Bangkok, Thailand is g + 7 And the formula for working out the time in Santiago, Chile, is g - 4 These formulae allow us to substitute 'g' for any time in London to find out the time in Bangkok or Santiago. Q1. Using the formula above, find the time in Bangkok when it is 14.00 hours in London. Q2. What time is it in Santiago, Chile, when the time in London is 20.00 hours? A1. Time in Bangkok = g + 7. Substitute the 14 for the g. g + 7 = 14 + 7 = 21 So at 14.00 hours in London, the time in Bangkok is 21.00 hours. A2. The formula for working out the time in Santiago is g - 4 When g = 20, g - 4 = 20 - 4 = 16 So at 20.00 hours in London, the time in Santiago is 16.00 hours. Here is the formula to convert the temperature in degrees Fahrenheit (Â°F) to the temperature in degrees Celsius (Â°C) c = 5(f - 32) / 9 where f represents the temperature in Â°F. To find the temperature in Â°C when it is 68Â°F, substitute 68 for the f in the formula. When f = 68, 5(f - 32) Ã· 9 = 5(68 - 32) Ã· 9 Remember to work out any calculation in brackets first: (68 - 32) = 36. A number next to anything in brackets means the contents of the brackets should be multiplied, so 5(36) means 5 Ã— 36: 5(36) Ã· 9 = (5 Ã— 36) Ã· 9 = 180 Ã· 9 = 20 What is the temperature in Â°C when it is 77Â°F?	5
Sometimes you need to rearrange the formula to find the value you're looking for. The area of a circle (A) is Ï€r2. This is useful if we know the radius of the circle and want to know the area. But what if we want to find the radius? We need a formula that has r = (some expression in A). We get this by rearranging the A = Ï€r2 formula like this: [Start by dividing both sides by Ï€ ] [Then find the square root of both sides] [Swap the sides to make it easier to read] The formula has been rearranged. We say that now r is the subject of the formula. Q1. The formula to find the circumference of a circle: C = 2Ï€r Rearrange the formula to make r the subject. Q2. The formula to convert the temperature in Â°F to the temperature in Â°C is : c = 5(f -32)/9 Rearrange this formula so that it will convert the temperature in Â°C to the temperature in Â°F (so that f is the subject). Write down your working, then check your answer. A1. C = 2Ï€r, so divide both sides by 2Ï€ A2. c = 5(f -32)/9 9c = 5(f â€“ 32) [multiply by 9] 9c/5 = f - 32 [divide by 5] 9c/5 + 32 = f [add 32] or, f = 9c/5 + 32	5

You will find it useful to understand An introduction to equations and Coordinates before tackling this section. This section looks at plotting and interpreting the graphs of straight lines as equations in x and y. This Revision Bite covers: The form x = c and y = c The form y = mx + c Plotting y = ax + b using tables Plotting ax + by = c	5
Graphs of this type have either a horizontal or vertical straight line. All the points on this line have a y coordinate of 4 so you can say that the equation of the line is y = 4. All the points on this line have an x coordinate of 7 so you can say that the equation of the line is x = 7. All vertical line graphs have an equation of the form x = c eg x = 1, x = -3, x = 4, etc. All horizontal line graphs have an equation of the form y=c eg y = 3, y = -2, y = 1, etc. If you can't remember whether the equation of the line is of the form x = ... or y = ..., find the coordinates of at least two points on the line. If the x coordinates are the same, the equation of the line will be x = ... If the y coordinates are the same, the equation of the line will be y = ...	5
The equation of a straight line on a graph is made up of a y term, an x term, and a number and are written in the form of y = mx + c. The slope of the line is known as the gradient and is represented by m in the equation. The point at which the line crosses the y-axis is the c in the equation. All the points that lie on the blue line have a y coordinate that is the same as the x coordinate eg (-1,-1) and (2,2) We say that the equation of the line is y = x All the points that lie on the orange line have a y coordinate (the second number in brackets) that is one number higher than the x coordinate of the same line eg (-3,-2) and (0,1) In other words, the y coordinate equals the x coordinate + 1 So the equation of the line is y = x + 1 What is the equation of this line? The co-ordinates of the points are (2,4), (1,2) and (-2, -4). The equation of the line that fits these x and y values is y = 2x	5
To plot a graph, you need to find some coordinates that satisfy the equation of the graph. Plot the graph of y = 2x + 1 We need to choose values for x and see what value of y they give. When x = -2 y = (2 Ã— -2) + 1 = -3 When x = 0 y = (2 Ã— 0) + 1 = 1 When x = 2 y = (2 Ã— 2) + 1 = 5 You can show this in a table: You can now plot these points and join them to give the graph of y = 2x + 1:	5
Tables work well when you're plotting graphs of the form y = mx + c, but what happens when the equation isn't in this form? Plot the graph of 2y - 4x = 3 Notice that this equation is not in the form y = mx + c. You need to rearrange the equation into a form with just the y value on the left of the equation. So add 4x to both sides to give 2y = 4x + 3 To find y divide both sides by 2 to give y = 2x + 3/2 Now that you have found the equation in terms of y, you can plot the graph using the usual method.	5
Make sure that you are confident with the work covered in Introduction to Equations and More on Equations before attempting this Revision Bite. You will also find it helpful to revise the work covered in Graphs too. This Revision Bite covers:	5
In an equation the '=' sign means that the two sides are identical. But what happens when the two sides are not identical? If this is the case you need to use inequalities to show the relationship between the two sides. < means 'less than' â‰¤ means 'less than or equal to' > means 'greater than' â‰¥ means 'greater than or equal to' For example, if x > 2, then x = 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, ... (x is greater than, but not equal to 2, so don't include the 2). If y is â‰¤ 4, then y = 4, 3, 2, 1, 0, -1, ... (y is less than or equal to 4, so do include the 4). If z â‰¥ 3, what are the possible values of z? 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, ... z is greater than or equal to 3, so it can be 3 and any number greater than 3.	5
Inequalities can also be represented on a number line. This shows x is greater than or equal to -1 x â‰¥ -1 This shows x is less than 2 x < 2 This shows that x is greater than or equal to-1 and x is less than 3 x â‰¥ -1 and x < 3. We can write this in one single line as -1 â‰¤ x < 3 Notice that we change round the order of the first part, but it still means the same thing. x â‰¥-1 means the same as -1 â‰¤ x What inequality is represented by the following number line? There is a solid dot on 0, so x â‰¥ 0, and a hollow dot on 4 so x < 4.	5
If an inequality isn't as straightforward as x > a, or y > b, you need to rearrange the inequality to be able to solve it. Solve the inequality: 5y + 1 < 26 First, you need to get the y values on their own, so minus 1 from each side to give: 5y < 25 To find y, divide both sides by 5 to give: y < 5	5
We already know how to solve equations in one unknown, but what happens when there are two unknowns? A pair of equations with more than one value to be found is called simultaneous equations. The two equations cannot be solved on their own. Each one by itself has infinitely many solutions. For example x + y = 10 has infintely many values for x and y for which this is true, like x=1, y=9 or x=10, y=0 or x=100, y=-90, etc. But you can use two equations together to make one equation that has only one solution. The x and y values of this solution will solve both of the original equations at the same time. This is why they are called simultaneous equations, because you are trying to solve them both with the same values for x and y. Solve the simultaneous equations: Begin by labelling the equations (1) and (2): Equation (1) tells you that y = 2x, so substitute this value of y into the second equation. x + 2x = 6 3x = 6 x = 2 This gives you the value of x, but what is the value of y? Equation (1) tells you that y = 2x, so y must be 4. You can check your answer in the other equation (in this case, (2)). 2 + 4 = 6 This is right, so the values are correct. The solution of the equations is therefore x = 2, y = 4 Use the substitution method to solve the following simultaneous equations: First label the equations. Substitute the value of y from equation (1) into equation (2) 2x + (x + 2) = 11 3x + 2 = 11 3x = 9 x = 3 To find y use this x value in equation (1): y = x + 2 = 3 + 2 = 5 Check in equation (2): (2 Ã— 3) + 5 = 11 (which is correct) So the solution is x = 3, y = 5	5
You can solve simultaneous equations by adding or subtracting the two equations from each other. This is called the algebraic method. Solve the simultaneous equations: Add the two equations together and you will find that the y disappears: 3x + 2x + y - y = 9 + 1 This can be simplified to: 5x = 10 x = 2 Substituting this value of x in (1) gives: 4 + y = 9 y = 5 Check in (2): 6 - 5 = 1 (which is correct) So the solution is: x = 2, y = 5 To make the 3x's disappear we can subtract equation (2) from equation (1): 3x - 3x + 2y - (-y) = 8 - 5 This simplifies to 3y = 3 y = 1 Substitute in (1): 3x + 2 = 8 3x = 6 x = 2 Check in (2) 6 - 1 = 5 (which is correct) So the solution is x = 2, y = 1	5
As well as solving simultaneous equations algebraically, you can solve them by rearranging them into the form of y = mx+c so that you can plot as straight line graphs. When you have plotted the graphs, you can work out the values of x and y that solve the equations. To refresh your knowledge of straight line graphs, look at Graphs: y = mx+c Use the graphical method to solve the simultaneous equations: y = 2x 2x + y = 8 Start by rearranging the two equations to get them in the form: y = mx + c In this case you only need to rearrange the second equation. The two equations are now: y = 2x y = -2x + 8 We now have two equations of straight-line graphs, which we can plot. When we do this we can look at where the two lines cross (the point of intersection). The values of x and y at this point are the solutions of the simultaneous equations. The solution of this pair of simultaneous equations is x = 2 and y = 4	5
What do common differences have do with linear sequences? Find out and discover some rules.	5
A number pattern which increases (or decreases) by the same amount each time is called a linear sequence. The amount it increases or decreases by is known as the common difference. This Revision Bite covers:	5
To find the common difference, you need to know how much the terms are increasing or decreasing by from one term to the next. Find the common difference and the next two terms of the following sequence. The common difference is -2. The next two terms are 8 and 6.	5
Sometimes, rather than finding the next number in a linear sequence, you want to find the 41st number, or 110th number, say. Writing out 41 or 110 numbers takes a long time, so you can use a general rule. To find the value of any term in a sequence, use the nth term rule. What is the nth term of this sequence? For example, to find the 10th term, work out 5 Ã— 10 = 50. To find the 7th term, work out 5 Ã— 7 = 35 So the 41st term is 5 Ã— 41 = 205 and the 110th term is 5 Ã— 110 = 550 What are the nth term and the 10th term of this sequence: 2, 4, 6, ... ? nth term = 2n 10th term = 20. To work this out, n = 10, so 2n = 2 Ã— 10 = 20	5
So the sequence of numbers in the 5 times table has a common difference of 5 and an nth term of 5n. But what happens if things get more complicated? The common difference is still 5, but it's not the 5 times table. The 5 times table is 5, 10, 15, ... The sequence is 7, 12, 17, ... Each term in the sequence is 2 more than the corresponding term in the 5 times table, so the nth term is 5n + 2. What is the nth term of the Sequence: 8, 11, 14, ... ? The common difference is 3, so it must be related to the 3 times table (3n) The 3 times table is 3, 6, 9, ... The sequence is 8, 11, 14, .... Every term in the sequence is 5 more than the corresponding term in the 3 times table, so the nth term is 3n + 5.	5
The factors of a number are any numbers that divide into it exactly. The factors of 12 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6 and 12 The factors of 18 are 1, 2, 3, 6, 9 and 18 1, 2, 3 and 6 are factors of both 12 and 18. They are known as the common factors of 12 and 18. So the Highest Common Factor (HCF) of 12 and 18 is 6. What is the HCF of 24 and 30? The factors of 24 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12 and 24 The factors of 30 are 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 10, 15 and 30. So the HCF of 24 and 30 is 6. The multiples of a number are all the numbers that it will divide into. The multiples of 4 are 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 28, 32, 36, 40, 44, ... The multiples of 6 are 6, 12, 18, 24, 30, 36, 42, 48, 54, 60, 66, ... 12, 24, and 36 are multiples of both 4 and 6 and are known as the common multiples of 4 and 6. The lowest number that is a multiple of 4 and 6 is 12. So the LCM of 4 and 6 is 12. What is the LCM of 5 and 8? The multiples of 5 are 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40... The mulitples of 8 are 8, 16, 24, 32, 40, 48, 56... So the LCM of 5 and 8 is 40.	5
What follows a rule? A number pattern. Why not work some out?	5
A number pattern is a series of numbers that follow a rule. This Revision Bite covers:	5
Any number that can be divided by 2 is called an even number. Examples of even numbers are 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 22, 144 and 2020. If a number ends with an even digit, then it is even. For example 1 023 458 is even, because its final digit (8) is even. Any number that cannot be divided by 2 is called an odd number. Examples of odd numbers are 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 35, 177, 2435, etc. If a number ends with an odd digit, then it is odd. For example 3 702 443 is odd, because its final digit (3) is odd.	5
Square numbers are formed by multiplying a number by itself. The first four square numbers are 1 Ã— 1 = 1 2 Ã— 2 = 4 3 Ã— 3 = 9 4 Ã— 4 = 16 Each square number can be represented as a square of dots. Write down the next six square numbers (from 5 onwards). Then check your answer. So the next square numbers are: 25, 36, 49, 64, 81 and 100	5
Cube numbers are formed by multiplying a digit by itself three times. For example 2 cubed is 2 Ã— 2 Ã— 2 = 8 3 cubed is 3 Ã— 3 Ã— 3 = 27 4 cubed is 4 Ã— 4 Ã— 4 = 64 Each cube number can be represented by a cube made up of unit cubes. Use your calculator to find the next six cube numbers (from 5 onwards) - then check your answer. So the next six cube numbers are: 125, 216, 343, 512, 729 and 1000	5
Triangle numbers can be represented as a triangle of dots. The triangle numbers are: What is the next triangle number after 21? The next row of the triangle will have 7 dots. So the next number is 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 = 28	5
The multiples of a number are those numbers that it will divide into exactly. For example, the multiples of 5 are 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30,.... The multiples of 7 are 7, 14, 21, 28, 35, 42,.... Remember: Multiples are like times tables. What are the first five multiples of 11? 11, 22, 33, 44, and 55 Remember that the first multiple is always the number itself.	5
The next number is 10 + 4 = 14 The next number is 9 Ã· 3 = 3 The next number is (14 -1) Ã— 2 = 26 Each number in a number pattern is called a term. So in the number pattern 2, 6, 10 ... the first term is 2, the second term is 6 and the third term is 10. Write down the rule and the next two terms in the number pattern: 2, 4, 8,... Then check your answer. The rule is 'multiply by 2' and the next 2 terms are 16 and 32. Look at how patterns change from one term to another. See what rule gets you from the 1st term to the 2nd term, then check the same rule gets you from the 2nd term to the 3rd term. If it doesn't, find a different rule to get to the 2nd number and then check that it gets you to the 3rd number.	5
A number pattern in a diagram often requires counting shapes to find the rule. Again, look at how the pattern grows from one term to the next. Q1. Based on the number patterns above, draw pattern 4. Q2. Look again at the number patterns above. Write the rule and the fourth terms for: a) orange tiles b) blue tiles c) all tiles A1. Pattern 4 has 3 orange tiles and 9 blue tiles, so 12 tiles altogether A2. a) The rule for the number pattern of orange tiles is 'add 1' and the 4th term is 3. b) The rule for the number pattern of blue tiles is 'add 2' and the 4th term is 9. c) The rule for the number pattern of all tiles is 'add 3' and the 4th term is 12.	5
Want to investigate? Try to find out some values.	5
In a quadratic sequence difference between the terms changes. This Revision Bite covers: Finding the nth term, multiples of powers	5
Look at this sequence: The differences between the terms are all different. However, if you look at the differences between the differences there is a pattern. This means that it is a quadratic sequence. +3, +5, +7, +9 are the first differences, And +2, +2, +2 are the second differences. Use this pattern of differences to find the next term of the sequence:	5
Look again at the sequence of square numbers: The diagram shows that: the first term is 1 (12) the second term is 4 (22) the third term is 9 (32) the fourth term is 16 (42) Whenever a sequence has a second difference of 2, it will be connected to the sequence of square numbers and the nth term will have something to do with n2. What is the nth term of the sequence 3, 6, 11, 18, 27, ... ? The second difference is 2, so the nth term has something to do with n2. The sequence of square numbers is: 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, ... Our sequence is: 3, 6, 11, 18, 27, ... Can you see the difference? Each term is 2 bigger than the corresponding term in the sequence of square numbers, so the rule for the nth term is n2 + 2. What is the nth term of the sequence 0, 3, 8, 15, 24, ... ? n2 - 1 The second differences are 2, so the formula has something to do with n2. The sequence of square numbers is: 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, ... Our sequence is: 0, 3, 8, 15, 24, ... Each term in our sequence is 1 less than the corresponding term in the sequence of square numbers, so the rule for the nth term is n2 - 1.	5
Any sequence involving n2 has a second difference of 2, but what happens when the sequence involves 2n2, 3n2, 4n2 etc? The sequence of square numbers (n2) is 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, ... So the sequence 2n2 is double this: 2, 8, 18, 32, 50, ... And the sequence 3n2 is three times as big: 3, 12, 27, 48, 75, ... Now look in more detail at the sequences for 2n2 and 3n2: The sequence 2n2 has a second difference of 4 and the sequence 3n2 has a second difference of 6. (1)n2 You can now find the nth term of any quadratic sequence of the form an2 + b. Find the nth term of the sequence 1, 10, 25, 46, 73, ... The second difference is 6, so the formula has something to do with 3n2 The sequence 1n2 is: 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, ... The sequence 3n2 is: 3, 12, 27, 48, 75, ... Our sequence is: 1, 10, 25, 46, 73, ... Each number is 2 less than the corresponding number in the sequence 3n2, so the nth term of our sequence is 3n2 - 2.	5
There are different ways to gather and present quantitative data. Decide on the best methods to use for the information you collect.	5
What can you do to gather data? See how here.	5
When you carry out an investigation, you will collect lots of data which you need to record and then draw conclusions from. This Revision Bites looks at ways of collecting, recording, organising and interpreting the data. This Revision Bite covers: Two-way tables	5
You can record your results in a tally chart, like this: As you can see, using groups of five makes it easier to see the total.	5
Using the tally system to record your results is faster than writing out words or figures all the time. If you record your findings in a tally chart, the data is already collected into groups, and you will not need to group it later on. To investigate the most popular colour of car passing your house, it is easier to draw tally marks in one of five columns than to write red, blue, silver, silver, red, other, black etc. If you use a tally chart, you could note down the colour of the cars as they pass, and find the total frequencies at the end of the one-hour period. Look at the tally chart below. It shows how many CDs students in the maths class own. Fill in the frequency values in the right hand column.	5
When there are a large number of possible outcomes, you will usually need to group the data. To do this, first decide on your class intervals based on the range of likely possible answers. You are carrying out a survey to determine the number of magazines bought by your classmates in the past year. The possible answers are likely to range from 0 to 100, so you might draw a tally chart with groupings similar to the one below: The completed frequency table is known as a grouped frequency table.	5
You can use a two way table to show two sets of information. Aled carried out a survey to see how many of his classmates are left-handed. His results are shown in the table below: This is an example of a two-way table and it is used to show two different features in a survey. In this case it shows: You can find out lots of information from this table. For example, you can see that there are 2 left-handed boys in the class. You can also see that there are 13 girls in the class (1 left-handed and 12 not left-handed) Q1. How many right-handed children are there in the class? Q2. How many children are there in total? A1. There are 14 right-handed boys and 12 right-handed girls, so 14 + 12 = 26 in total. A2. There are 29 children in total. This is the total of all the numbers in the table.	5
Continuous data is data which can take any value. Examples include time, height and weight. Because continuous data can take any value, there are an infinite number of possible outcomes. So continuous data must be grouped before it can be represented in a frequency table or statistical diagram. When choosing groups for the data, make sure that each piece of data can be placed in one (and only one) of the groups. You are investigating the length of time each member of a class spends on the internet per week. Look at the class groupings below - do you think they are right? These groups are wrong, because the times of '10 hours' and '20 hours' can be entered into two different groups. For example, the time 10 hours can be entered into 0 â‰¤ time â‰¤10 (where time is less than or equal to 10 hours), and also into 10 â‰¤ time â‰¤ 20 (where time is more than or equal to 10 hours). These groups are also wrong, because the times '10 hours' and '20 hours' cannot be entered into any of the groups. For example, the time 10 hours can neither be entered into 0 < time < 10 (where time is less than 10 hours), nor can it be entered into 10 < time < 20 (where time is more than 10 hours). These groupings are right. '10 hours' is included in the second group, but not the first and '20 hours' is included in the third group, but not the second.	5
Cameron records the heights of 30 of his classmates. His results are shown below: Copy the tally chart and complete it with Cameron's results:	5
A stem and leaf diagram is one way of grouping your data into classes and showing the shape of the data. A maths test is marked out of 50. The marks for the class are shown below: This is all the information you need, but it is very hard to interpret. For example, is it easy to tell whether more children got marks in the 20s than the 30s? Can you tell at a glance what the highest mark was, or whether more than one person achieved the same result? One way to represent the data so that you can answer these questions is in a stem and leaf diagram. This diagram shows exactly the same results as in the example above: The stem and leaf diagram is formed by splitting the numbers into two parts - in this case tens and units. The tens form the 'stem' and the units form the 'leaves'. This information is given in the Key. The numbers are usually ordered, so the row: shows the numbers 21, 23, 24, 24, 25, and 27 in order. Using the stem and leaf diagram above, answer the following questions. Q1. How many children scored 36? Q2. What was the most common score? A1. You can work this out by looking at the 3 column in the 10s: Therefore 2 children score 36. A2. You can work this out from the stem and leaf diagram below: Therefore 17 was the most common score.	5
Mean, median and mode - how can you calculate these types of averages?	5
A measure of average is a number that is typical for a set of figures. Finding the average helps you to draw conclusions from data. The main types are mean, median and mode. This Revision Bite covers:	5
The mean is the most common measure of average. To calculate the mean add the numbers together and divide the total by the amount of numbers: Mean = sum of numbers Ã· amount of numbers Five friends compare their marks in a French test. These are shown below: What is the mean mark? Check your answer by asking yourself if it looks about right. If you had forgotten to divide by 5 then the answer would have been 265, which would not have made sense. Always check that your answer seems sensible. A die is thrown 10 times. The following results are obtained: 3, 5, 1, 2, 6, 4, 2, 5, 6, 1 What is the mean score? To find the answer, add the numbers together and divide by the amount of numbers: Mean = (3 + 5 + 1 + 2 + 6 + 4 + 2 + 5 + 6 + 1) Ã· 10 35 Ã· 10 = 3.5	5
If you place a set of numbers in order, the median number is the middle one. If there are two middle numbers, the median is the mean of those two numbers. Find the median of each of the following sets of numbers: a) 2, 4, 7, 1, 9, 3, 11 b) 4, 1, 3, 10, 6, 9, a) Place the numbers in order: 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 9, 11 The middle number is 4. Therefore the median is 4. b) Place the numbers in order: 1, 3, 4, 6, 9, 10 there are two middle numbers (4 and 6), so we find the mean of these two numbers. The median is therefore: If there are n numbers, the median will be the (n + 1) Ã· 2 = th number If there are 3 numbers, the median will be the (3 + 1) Ã· 2 = 2nd number. If there are 4 numbers, the median will be the (4 + 1) Ã· 2 = 21/2th number Rachel records the number of goals scored by her five-a-side team in their first 20 matches. The results are shown in the frequency table below: What is the median number of goals scored? 20 matches were played, so the median will be the 21 Ã· 2 th value. 7 matches scored 0 goals, and 5 matches scored 1 goal. The 21 Ã· 2 th value lies in the '1 goal' category. 21 Ã· 2 = 10 1/2 Therefore, the median number of goals is 1.	5
The mode is the value that occurs most often. The mode is the only average that can have more than one value. When finding the mode, it helps to order the numbers first. Find the mode of each of the following sets of numbers: a) 3, 7, 1, 3, 4, 8, 3 b) 2, 7, 2, 1, 4, 7, 3 a) Start by placing the numbers in order: 1, 3, 3, 3, 4, 7, 8 The number 3 occurs most often so the mode is 3. b) Start by placing the numbers in order: 1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 7, 7 The numbers 2 and 7 occur more often than all other numbers so the modes are 2 and 7. In this frequency table, the mode is the value with the highest frequency: In this example the modal shoe size is 7, because more people take size 7 than any other size.	5
The range is the difference between the highest and lowest values in a set of numbers. To find it, subtract the lowest number in the distribution from the highest. Find the range of the following set of numbers: a) 23, 27, 40, 18, 25 b) 25, 26, 57, 15, 47 a) The largest value is 40 and the smallest value is 18. Therefore, the range is 40 - 18 = 22. b) The largest value is 57 and the smallest value is 15. Therefore the range is 57 - 15 = 42.	5
Complete the following table. The data shows the scores in two tests, English and Maths, across a set of ten students. If you were to compare the scores in the two subjects, English and Maths, which measure of average would you use and why? Range The range of scores in English (37) is far greater than that in the Maths (4). Mean The mean score in each subject is 78 which implies that the scores of the students are more-or-less identical in English and Maths. But looking at the actual scores, you can see that this is not the case. Median If you compare the medians (71 and 78), you might assume that the students generally scored less in English, (which is partly true, but there are also some much higher scores there too). Mode If you just state the modal score for each subject (101 and 78), you have no information about the scores of the other students. So, which is best? It seems that to give maximum information, a combination of the median and the range would be best. So, in summary, English has a median score of 71 and a range of 37, and Maths has a median score of 78 and a range of 4.	5
Sara wanted to know the ages (in whole years) of children on her school bus. She conducted a survey and her results are shown below: To find the mean add all the ages together and divide by the total number of children. If you type all those ages into a calculator it is highly likely that you would make a mistake or forget where you were up to. It would be better if you could see these results displayed in a frequency table: The frequency table shows us that there are six children aged 11, seven children aged 12, five children aged 13...etc. To find the sum of their ages, calculate: (6 Ã— 11) + (7 Ã— 12) + (5 Ã— 13) + (7 Ã— 14) + (3 Ã— 15) + (2 Ã— 16) = 390 The total number of children is 6 + 7 + 5 + 7 + 3 + 2 = 30 So the mean age is 390 Ã· 30 = 13 You could also write this information into the table as shown below:	5
Calculating the mean and modal class for grouped data is very similar to finding the mean from an ungrouped frequency table, except that you do not have all the information about the data within the groups so can only estimate the mean. This table shows the weights of children in a class. Using this information: a) Estimate the mean weight b) Find the modal class To estimate the mean weight, you know that 7 children are between 30kg and 40kg, but you don't know exactly how much they weigh, so assume that they all weigh 35kg (the midpoint of the group). Do the same for all the other groups: a) Estimate of mean = 1215 Ã· 25 = 48.6 kg b) The modal class is the class that has the highest frequency. In this case the modal class is 50 â‰¤ m < 60	5
Aren't there so many possibilities? See how probable outcomes can be.	5
Probability is the maths of chance. A probability is a number that tells you how likely (probable) something is to happen. This Revision Bite covers:	5
We often make judgments as to whether an event will take place, and use words to describe how probable that event is. For example, we might say that it is likely that the sun will come up tomorrow, or that it is impossible to find somebody who is more than 3m tall. Maths uses numbers to describe probabilities. Probabilities can be written as fractions, decimals or percentages. You can also use a probability scale, starting at 0 (impossible) and ending at 1 (certain). Here are some events placed on the probability scale. Now try to order the probabilities in the activity below.	5
When you throw a die (plural: dice), there are six possible different outcomes. It can show either 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6. But how many possible ways are there of obtaining an even number? There are three possibilities: 2, 4 and 6. The probability of obtaining an even number is 3/6 (= 1/2 or 0.5 or 50%) The probability of an outcome = number of ways the outcome can happen Ã· total number of possible outcomes Q1. How many outcomes are there for the following experiments? List all the possible outcomes. a) Tossing a coin b) Choosing a sweet from a bag containing 1 red, 1 blue, 1 white and 1 black sweet. c) Choosing a day of the week at random. Q2. Sindhu writes the letters of the word 'MATHEMATICS' on separate cards and places them in a bag. She then draws a card at random. What is the probability that Sindhu chooses the letter 'A'? A1. a) There are two possible outcomes (head and tail). b) There are four possible outcomes (red, blue, white and black). c) There are seven possible outcomes (Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday and Saturday). A2. There are 11 letters in MATHEMATICS, 2 of which are A, so the probability that Sindhu chooses the letter A is 2/11.	5
What is wrong with the following statement? The probability of obtaining a 6 when I throw a die is 1/6 - so if I throw the die 6 times I should get exactly 1 Ã— 6. In theory this statement is true, but in practise it might not be the case. Try throwing a die 6 times - you won't always get one 6. Kate and Josh each throw a die 30 times. a) How many times would you expect Kate to obtain a 6? b) How many times would you expect Josh to obtain a 6? c) How many times would you expect Kate or Josh to obtain a 6? a) In theory, Kate should obtain a 6 on 1/6 of her throws. Therefore, in theory she should throw a 6 on 5 of her 30 throws. b) Josh should also throw to obtain a 6 on 5 of his 30 throws. c) In total, Kate and Josh have thrown the die 60 times. You would expect them to obtain a 6 on 10 of those throws. However, it is very unlikely that Kate and Josh obtained exactly the same results, or that either of them threw a 6 on 5 occasions. As you can see, if an experiment is repeated, the results are not necessarily the same each time. However, it is more likely that their combined results were closer to the expected outcome (10 Ã— 6s) than their individual results. In other words, if you do a large number of trials you will get a more accurate result.	5
Probability is often based on surveys, because you get a more accurate measure of probability by basing your calculation on a large number of results. Alex is doing some reporting for his local paper. The subject of his article is 'holidays'. As part of his report he decides to question 10 of his friends whether they prefer caravanning or camping holidays. Seven out of 10 say that they prefer caravanning, so Alex writes the dramatic headline you see above. What is wrong with Alex's method? Alex has based his probability on a very small survey. This is equivalent to throwing a die 10 times, throwing a 6 nine times by chance, and stating that the probability of obtaining a 6 is 9/10! To estimate probabilities from the results of surveys, you must gather a large number of results.	5
If you toss a coin, the probability of obtaining a head is 1/2 and the probability of obtaining a tail is also 1/2. P(head) + P(tail) = 1 / 2 + 1 / 2 = 1 If we choose a letter at random from the word 'SUMS', the probability of obtaining the letter 'S' is 2 / 4, the probability of obtaining the letter 'U' is 1 / 4 and the probability of obtaining the letter 'M' is 1 / 4. P(S) + P(U) + P(M) = 2 / 4 + 1 / 4+ 1 / 4 = 1 The probability that I am late for work tomorrow is 2/9. What is the probability that I am not late for work? There are two possible outcomes - being late and not being late. The sum of their probabilities must add up to 1, so the probability of not being late is 1 - 2/9 = 7/9	5
You already know that the probabibility of an outcome is: However, finding the total number of possible outcomes is not always straightforward - especially when we have more than one event. Two coins are tossed, once each. What is the total number of possible outcomes when they land, with either their heads or their tails uppermost? The total number of possible outcomes is not three (two heads, a head and a tail or two tails). To find the true number of possible outcomes, we must list the results or use a table. 1. Using a list 2. Using a table From both these methods we can see that there are four possible outcomes. We can use this fact to calculate probabilities. Eg: there is only one way of obtaining two heads, so the probability (P) of obtaining 2 heads is 1/4 . We can say P (two heads) = 1/4 There are two ways of obtaining a head and a tail, so P (head and tail) = 2/4 = 1/2 When listing possible outcomes, try to be as logical as possible. If you repeat or forget any of them, it will affect the rest of your answers. Two tetrahedral (four-sided) dice are thrown Copy and complete the following table, which shows the sum of their scores: a) What is the most likely outcome? b) What is the probability that the sum of the scores will be 3? c) What is the probability that the sum of the scores will be greater than 5? a) 5 is the most likely outcome b) The probability of getting the sum 3 = 2 / 16 = 1/8 c) The probability of a sum greater than 5 = 6 / 16 = 3/8	5
When you toss a coin, there is an equal chance of obtaining a head or a tail. When you throw a die, the probability of getting a 6 is 1/6. But what is the probability that when you look out of a window at a street, the next car that passes will be red? You can no longer use equally likely outcomes for this. You need to use relative frequency. This Revision Bite covers:	5
For an experiment or survey: Relative frequency = number of times the event happens Ã· total number of trials For example, if you observed 100 passing cars and found that 23 of them were red, the relative frequency is 23/100. In the Probability Revision Bite, you learnt that you get a more accurate result in surveys of events if you carry out a large number of trials or survey a large number of people. A bag contains 3 red sweets and 7 blue sweets. Tom took a sweet from the bag, noted its colour and then replaced it. He did this 10 times and found that he obtained a red sweet on 4 occasions (ie the relative frequency was 4/10). He then carried out the experiment another 10 times, combined his results with the first trial and saw that - in total - he had obtained a red sweet on 5 out of 20 occasions (ie the relative frequency was 5/20 ). Tom continued in this way, recording his combined results after every 10 trials and showing them on the graph below: We can see from the graph that relative frequency gets better (ie closer to the true probability) as the number of trials increases.	5
Try out these example questions about relative frequency. Q1. 100 people were asked whether they were left-handed. Four people answered 'yes'. What is the relative frequency of 'left-handed'? Q2. A white counter was taken from a bag of different coloured counters, and then replaced. The relative frequency of getting a white counter was found to be 0.3. If the bag contained 20 counters, estimate the number of white counters. A1. The relative frequency is 4/100 = 1/25 or 0.04 A2. The relative frequency of white counters is 0.3, and there are 20 counters in the bag, so, as an estimate, 0.3 Ã— 20 = 6 white counters. Relative frequency can only be used as an estimate.	5
What's the best way to present data? Have a look at your options here.	5
When you have collected and recorded your data, you can represent it in a diagram. Depending on the results, you can use a frequency diagram, pie chart, line graph, pictogram, frequency diagram, frequency polygon or a scatter diagram. Make sure that you have looked at Collecting and Recording Data before tackling this section. This Revision Bite covers:	5
Use a bar chart to compare two or more values with a small set of results. In a bar chart, the height of the bar shows the frequency of the result. As the height of bar represents frequency, label the vertical axis 'Frequency'. The labelling of the horizontal axis depends on what is being represented by the bar chart. Leon conducts a survey to find the number of people in each of the cars arriving at his school gate between 8.30am and 9.00am. His results are shown in the bar chart below: a) How many cars contained 1 person? b) How many cars contained more than 3 people? c) Why there are only a small number of cars containing 1 person? a) 8 cars contained 1 person b) 14 cars contained more than 3 people (10 + 4 = 14) c) Most cars would be driven by parents bringing their children to school, only a few would contain just a teacher or a sixth former.	5
A line graph is often used to show a trend over a number of days or hours. It is plotted as a series of points, which are then joined with straight lines. The ends of the line graph do not have to join to the axes. This line graph shows the midday temperature over a period of 7 days. You can see at a glance that the temperature was at its highest on Monday and that it started to fall in the middle of the week before rising again at the end of the week. a) What was the lowest temperature and on what day did it occur? b) On what day was the midday temperature 26Â°C? a) The lowest temperature was 19Â°C and it occurred on Thursday. b) The midday temperature was 26Â°C on Tuesday.	5
Pictograms use pictures to represent data. To make sense, a pictogram must always have a key. This pictogram shows the number of pizzas eaten by four friends in the past month: The key tells you that one pizza on the pictogram represents 4 pizzas eaten, so Alan ate 4 + 2 = 6 pizzas. a) Who ate the most pizzas? b) How many pizzas did Bob eat? c) What was the total number of pizzas eaten by the four friends? a) Chris ate the most pizzas. c) There are a total of 111/2 circles in the pictogram. One circle represents 4 pizzas, so 111/2 Ã— 4 = 46 pizzas	5
Pie charts use different-sized sectors of a circle to represent data. This pie chart shows the results of a survey that was carried out to find out how students travel to school. a) What is the most common method of travel? b) What fraction of the students travel to school by car? c) If 6 students travel by car, how many people took part in the survey? a) The most common method of travel is bus as this has the largest sector on the pie chart. b) 1/4 of the students travel by car. c) 6 students travel by car, and this is 1/4 of the total. Therefore, 24 people were questioned for the survey. A supermarket chain sold 3600 packets of sausages last month. The pie chart shows the different flavours. a) How many packets of vegetarian sausages were sold? b) How many packets of beef sausages were sold? a) Vegetarian sausages account for 1/4 of the total sales, so calculate 1/4 of 3600. 1/4 Ã— 3600 = 900. Therefore, 900 packets of vegetarian sausages were sold last month. b)There are 360Â° in a complete turn. The 'beef' sector has an angle of 150Â°, so the beef sector is 150/360th of the circle. 150/360x 3600 = 1500. Therefore, 1500 packets of beef sausages were sold.	5
To construct a pie chart you need to work out the fraction of the total that the sector represents. You can then convert this to an angle and draw the sector on the chart. The table below shows the grades achieved by 30 pupils in their end-of-year exam. To show this information in a pie chart, take the following steps: Work out the total number of pupils: 7 + 11 + 6 + 4 + 2 = 30 To work out the angle of each segment, work out the fraction of the total that got each grade. Start with A grades: 7 /30 There are 360Â° in a full turn, so to work out the angle, multiply the fraction by 360: 7 /30 Ã— 360 = 84Â° Copy and complete the following table, then use the data to construct a pie chart.	5
This frequency diagram shows the heights of 200 people: You can construct a frequency polygon by joining the midpoints of the tops of the bars. Frequency polygons are particularly useful for comparing different sets of data on the same diagram.	5
Scatter diagrams show the relationship between two sets of variables. By looking at the diagram you can see whether there is a link between variables. Where there is a link it is called correlation. The English and Maths results of ten classmates are shown in the table below: To see whether there is a correlation between the Maths and English marks, you could plot a scatter diagram. The Maths mark is on the horizontal scale and the corresponding English mark on the vertical scale. Bill's Maths mark was 60 and his English mark was 65, so his results are represented by the orange point at coordinates (60, 65). In the scatter diagram above, whose mark does the small red cross represent? The co-ordinates of the cross are (80, 70). Therefore, the Maths mark is 80 and the English mark 70. The highlighted cross represents Jo's marks. You can see that all the points representing Maths marks and English marks lie approximately along a straight line. This shows that there is a correlation between these two variables. The table below shows the correlations that you can deduce from different patterns of scatter. The points lie close to a straight line, which has a positive gradient. This shows that as one variable increases the other increases. The points lie close to a straight line, which has a negative gradient. This shows that as one variable increases, the other decreases. There is no pattern to the points. This shows that there is no connection between the two variables. Would you expect there to be positive correlation, negative correlation, or no correlation between the following pairs of variables: a) Temperature and sales of ice-cream b) Height and intelligence a) As temperature increases, the sales of ice-cream are also likely to increase. Therefore, there is likely to be positive correlation. b) It is unlikely that there is a connection between height and intelligence. Therefore, there is no correlation.	5
The 'line of best fit' goes roughly through the middle of all the scatter points on a graph. The closer the points are to the line of best fit the stronger the correlation is. 10 pupils in a school study French and German at GCSE. Their marks for a recent test are recorded in the table below: You can draw a scatter diagram to represent these marks. As Pete was absent on the day of the German test you do not have enough information to mark his score. Looking at this scatter diagram there is strong positive correlation between the marks in French and the marks in German, so you can draw a line of best fit to show that trend. Pete scored 70 in French, so using the line of his best fit, you can estimate that his mark in German would have been 72. A line of best fit can only be drawn if there is strong positive or negative correlation. The line of best fit does not have to go through the origin. The line of best fit shows the trend, but it is only approximate and any readings taken from it will be estimations.	5
Units of measurement are helpful in a daily context. Knowing them can help you work out schedules, conversions, distances and sizes.	5
Can you find out some areas? Have a go here.	5
The area of a shape is a measure of the 2 dimensional space that it covers. Area is measured in squares - eg square cm, square metres and square km. This Revision Bite covers:	5
A square cm has a length of 1 cm. We say that it has an area of 1 cm2 ( 1 cm squared). This rectangle contains six squares. Each of the squares has an area of 1cm2, so the area of the rectangle is 6cm2. By counting the squares, find the area of the following shapes: a) a) 10cm2 b) 8cm2 Remember, there are six whole squares and four half squares in the triangle.	5
Another way to find the area of a rectangle is to multiply its length by its breadth. The formula is: area = length Ã— breadth We can rearrange this formula to find the length or the breadth: length = area Ã· breadth breadth = area Ã· length What is the length of this rectangle? The area is 56cm2 and the breadth is 7cm, so the length is 56 Ã· 7 = 8cm	5
Look at the triangle below: If you multiply the base by the perpendicular height, you get the area of a rectangle. The area of the triangle is half the area of the rectangle. So to find the area of a triangle, multiply the base by the perpendicular height and divide by two. The formula is: Find the area of this triangle: The area of the triangle is: (5 Ã— 8)/2 = 40/2 = 20cm2	5
There are two different methods for finding the area of this shape: Divide the shape into squares and rectangles, find their individual areas and then add them together. Area = 16 + 16 + 48 = 80cm2 Imagine the shape as a large rectangle with a section cut out. Find the area of the large rectangle (12 Ã— 8) and then subtract the part that has been cut out (4 Ã— 4)	5
The area of a parallelogram is the base Ã— perpendicular height (b Ã— h). You can see that this is true by rearranging the parallelogram to make a rectangle. Regular parallelogram showing base and height. Use the perpendicular height of the parallelogram, not the sloping height. Find the area of this parallelogram: The answer is 21cm2. Remember to use the perpendicular height.	5
You now know how to find the area of a parallelogram, but what happens if you need to find the base or the height? You just have to rearrange the formula. Q1. The area of this parallelogram is 12cm2. What is its perpendicular height? Q2. Find the length of the base of this parallelogram: A1. h = A Ã· b h = 12 Ã· 4 = 3cm A2. b = A Ã· h b = 40 Ã· 5 = 8cm Remember to divide the area by the perpendicular height.	5
Why not work out some perimeters? Do some quick calculations here.	5
The perimeter of a shape is the distance around its edge. Finding the perimeter just means adding up the lengths of all its sides. This Revision Bite covers:	5
The perimeter of a shape is the length of its boundary. Think of an ant starting from one corner of a small box, measuring 3 cm by 4cm. Imagine it walks all the way around the edge of the box. What distance will it have walked? When calculating the perimeter, remember to include the length of every side.	5
Sometimes the shape is more complicated. In this case you need to calculate 'missing' lengths and be particularly careful to include all the sides. A plan of a play area is shown below: a) Calculate the length of x and y b) Calculate the perimeter of the play area. a) The length of the play area is 20m, so x = 20 - 8 =12m. The width of the play area is 15m, so y = 15 - 5 = 10m.	5
Time has different units of measurement - seconds, hours, days etc. Knowing how to measure time is useful because it can help you find out when your favourite TV show is on, or how many days there are in a month. This Revision Bite covers: 12-hour and 24-hour clock	5
This table shows how the units we use to measure time compare. a) How many minutes are there in 6 hours? b) How many hours are there in a week? c) How many weeks are there in 63 days? a) 60 Ã— 6 = 360 minutes b) 24 Ã— 7 = 168 hours in one week c) 63 Ã· 7 = 9 weeks. Remember, there are 7 days in a week 0.5 hours = 30 minutes, not 50 minutes. This is because decimals show fractions of tenths, hundredths, thousandths and so on. But, minutes are measured in sixtieths of an hour. Similarly, 1/4 hour = 15 minutes, and 1/10 hour = 6 minutes.	5
Time is measured using either the 12-hour clock or the 24-hour clock. The 12-hour clock notation uses am and pm to indicate morning and afternoon. am is the time from 12 midnight and before 12 noon. pm is the time from 12 noon and before 12 midnight. 6.23am means 23 minutes past 6 in the morning 7.45am means quarter to 8 in the morning The 24-hour clock does not require the use of am or pm. Afternoon is indicated by a number bigger than 12. When converting from the 12-hour clock to the 24-hour clock remember: for any time after 12.59pm, add 12. 3.00pm becomes (3 + 12) = 15:00 5.46pm becomes (5.46 + 12) = 17:46 The 24-hour clock always uses 4 digits, so for any time before 10:00 a zero is placed at the beginning. Copy and complete the following table, then check your answers. 23:00 12.01pm 01:03 3.14pm	5
The following table shows the times of the buses from Cambridge to Duxford and Whittlesford: a) I want to go to the Duxford Imperial War Museum. Which bus should I catch from Cambridge? b) The 0805 from Cambridge is running 6 minutes late. What time does it reach Pampisford? c) If I arrive in Sawston at 0932, what time do I leave Cambridge? d) How long does the journey from Great Shelford to Duxford Wheatsheaf take? a) The only bus which goes to the Imperial War Museum leaves Cambridge at 0835. b) The 0805 usually arrives in Pampisford at 0838. So if it's running 6 minutes late it will arrive at 0844. c) 0905 d) The bus leaves Great Shelford at 0722 and arrives at Duxford Wheatsheaf at 0745. So it takes 23 minutes.	5
Use this rhyme to help you remember how many days there are in each month: 30 days has September, April, June and November. All the rest have 31, Except February alone, Which has 28 days clear, And 29 in each leap year. If March 28th is a Tuesday, what day is the April 6th in the same year? There are 31 days in March. There are 365 days in a year. Therefore a leap year, with its extra day in February, has 366. Leap years occur every four years, and are divisible by 4. 1996 was a leap year because 1996 Ã· 4 = 499 1934 was not a leap year because 1934 Ã· 4 = 483.5	5
Which units should you use? Decide on when and why you would need them.	5
Before you can measure something, you need to know what unit to use. You can do this by making an estimate of its approximate size. When converting between units, there are some simple rules you should follow. This Revision Bite covers: Speed, distance and time	5
The commonly used metric units of length include: To find a suitable unit to measure something in, you should first estimate how big it is. So, for example, do you think it's better to measure the distance between London and Manchester in metres or kilometres? Or, should an insect be measured in metres or millimetres? Imagine the length of the objects you are estimating or imagine measuring them in relation to other objects. For example: Q1. Which unit of measurement (km, m, cm or mm) would you use for the following? a) the length of your hand-span b) the length of a football pitch c) the thickness of a book d) the distance from London to Manchester Q2. a) Is the height of a tall man likely to be 90cm, 180cm or 360cm? b) Is the weight of a bag of sugar about 1kg, 10kg or 50kg? c) Does a large flask hold roughly 200ml, 1l or 10l of liquid? A1. a) cm b) m c) mm d) km A2. a) 180cm b) 1kg c) 1l	5
In this scale the difference between 5 and 6 is 1. And, the space has been divided into 4, so each division represents 1 Ã· 4 = 0.25. The arrow is pointing to 5 + 0.25 + 0.25 + 0.25 = 5.75 The difference between 50 and 60 is 10 and the space has been divided into 5. So, each division represents 10 Ã· 5 = 2. The arrow is pointing to 50 + 2 + 2 = 54.	5
The table shows some of the most common units and their equivalents. Make sure you know these conversions. To convert a larger unit to a smaller unit (eg m to cm), first check the number of smaller units needed to make 1 larger unit. Then, multiply that number by the number of larger units. To convert a smaller unit to a larger unit (eg cm to m), first divide it by the number of smaller units which are needed to make 1 larger unit. To convert from a larger unit to a smaller one, multiply. To convert from a smaller unit to a larger one, divide. 1m = 100cm So, to convert from m to cm multiply by 100, and to convert from cm to m divide by 100. For example: 3.2m = 320cm (3.2 Ã— 100 = 320) 400cm = 4m (400 Ã· 100 = 4) Convert the following to the units given in brackets: a) 5.12kg Remember that 1kg = 1000g. To convert from g to kg, divide by 1000. b) 150ml Remember that 1cl = 10ml. To convert from cl to ml, multiply by 10. c) 0.245m Remember that 1m = 1000mm. To convert from mm to m, divide by 1000.	5
The method for converting between units works the same as the one for converting units of area and volume. When you are converting one sort of unit to another, you need to know how many smaller units are needed to make 1 larger unit (eg 1000m2 = 1km2). When converting from a larger unit to a smaller unit (eg m2 to cm2), you multiply. When converting from a smaller unit to a larger unit (eg cm2 to mm2), you divide. 1m = 100cm. You are converting from a smaller unit (cm2) to a larger unit (m2), so divide. 1cm = 10mm. You are converting from a larger unit (cm3) to a smaller unit (mm3), so multiply.	5
To check the accuracy of a rounded number, you need to find the largest and smallest numbers that it could have been rounded from. Q1. The number of children in a school is 800, correct to the nearest 100. What is the largest possible, and smallest possible number of children in the school? Q2. Amelia spends Â£80 in the local supermarket, correct to the nearest Â£10. What is the greatest and least amount that Amelia could have spent? A1. The number of children in the school has been rounded to the nearest 100 to give 800. The answer is 750 and 849. The smallest number that rounds to 800 is 750. The largest number that rounds to 800 is 849. So, the smallest possible number of children in the school is 750, and the largest possible number of children is 849. Note: 850 is exactly halfway between 800 and 900, but 850 rounds up to give 900, so we use 849. A2. The answer is Â£75.00 and Â£84.99. The smallest number that rounds to Â£80 is Â£75. The largest number that rounds to Â£80 is Â£84.99. Remember that Â£85 is halfway between Â£80 and Â£90, but 85 rounds up to 90, so we must go for the smallest possible unit less than 85 (in this case a penny less), which is Â£84.99.	5
Speed is worked out by dividing the distance travelled by the time taken: If you travel at 70 km in 2 hours. What is your average speed? Speed = distance Ã· time The distance in km and the time in h, so the units for speed are km/h. If you know the speed, you can work out the time or the distance by re-arranging the equation. speed = distance Ã· time distance = speed Ã— time If you walk for 1 1/2 hours at an average speed of 4 miles/h. How far will you have walked? Speed = distance Ã· time Distance = Speed Ã— Time Distance = 4 Ã— 1.5 = 6 miles	5
How can you find the volume of different containers? By using formulas.	5
The volume of a shape is a measure of all of its 3d space. Simple formulas can help you find a shape's volume. This Revision Bite covers:	5
The volume of a shape measures the 3-dimensional amount of space that it takes up. Volume is measured in cubes. A cubic cm has sides of length 1cm. It has a volume of 1cm3 (1 cm cubed). This cuboid contains 12 cubes. Each cube has a volume of 1cm3. So the volume of this cuboid is 12cm3. Find the volume of the following cuboids: a) a) 8cm3 b) There are two rows of nine cubes, so the volume is 18cm3.	5
To find the volume of a cuboid multiply its length by its breadth by its height. We can write this as: The volume of this cereal packet is: What is the volume of this tin? Remember that volume = length Ã— breadth Ã— height, so in this example the volume is 4 Ã— 2 Ã— 6 = 48 cm3	5
You already know that the volume of a cuboid is length by its breadth by its height (l Ã— b Ã— h). The area of the shaded end of the cuboid (the cross section) is b Ã— h, so you can also say that the volume of a cuboid is: This formula works for all prisms: Q1. What is the volume of this triangular prism? Q2. What is the volume of this prism? A1. volume = area of triangle Ã— length = 1/2Ã— 2 Ã— 5 Ã— 4 = 20cm3 A2. The area of the cross section is 5cm2 and the length is 8cm, so the volume is 5 Ã— 8 = 40 cm3 Remember that the volume is the area of the cross section Ã— the length.	5
Complex and everyday calculations are addressed in this section. See how to use them in relation to money and different types of numbers.	5
Why not make an approximation? Have a try.	5
This Revision Bite looks at ways of simplifying calculations to find approximate solutions. This Revision Bite covers:	5
It is not always necessary to give the exact number. For example, if there were 54 785 inhabitants in a town, you could say that its population was approximately 55 000. By doing this we have rounded 54 785 to the nearest thousand to give 55 000. What is 1484.5 to the nearest 1000? It is between 1000 and 2000, but it is closer to 1000, so round down. 1484.5 rounded to the nearest thousand is 1000. What is 1484.5 to the nearest 100? 1484.5 is between 1400 and 1500, but it is closer to 1500, so round up. 1484.5 rounded to the nearest hundred is 1500. 1484.5 lies between 1480 and 1490, but it is closer to 1480, so round down. 1484.5 rounded to the nearest ten is 1480. 1484.5 lies between 1484 and 1485 and it is exactly halfway between them. In this situation round up. 1484.5 rounded to the nearest whole number is 1485.	5
Imagine that you are buying a t-shirt for Â£9.99, a pair of socks for Â£1.49 and a belt for Â£8.99 The cashier charges you Â£23.47. You feel that this is too much - but how do you know? One way of finding out whether you have been over-charged is to estimate what the total amount should be. Round the different prices into easier numbers - Â£9.99 is approximately Â£10, Â£1.49 is approximately Â£1.50 and Â£8.99 is approximately Â£9 - and you can do the calculation quickly in your head. This is almost Â£3 less than the cashier asked for, so obviously you have been over-charged. Note: the symbol â‰ˆ means 'approximately equal to'. By rounding the actual values to more manageable numbers, you can estimate the answers to many problems:	5
Decimal places are counted from the decimal point: So, the number 5.1492 has four decimal places and 4.34 has two decimal places. To round a number to a given number of decimal places, look at the number in the next decimal place. Q1. Round 7.2648 to 2 decimal places (d.p.) Q2. Round 8.352 to 1 decimal place A1. To round to two decimal places, look at the number in the third decimal place. It's a 4, so round down. Therefore, 7.2648 = 7.26 (2 d.p.) A2. To round to one decimal place, look at the number in the second decimal place. It's a 5, so round up. Therefore, 8.352 = 8.4 (1 d.p.) To round a number to a given number of decimal places then the answer must have that number of decimal places, even if you have to add some zeros. For example, rounding 3.40021 to two decimal places gives 3.40 (2 d.p. ). You need to write both decimal places, even though the second number is a zero, to show you rounded to two decimal places. Remember to look at the number after the one you're interested in. If it's less than 5, round down. If it's 5 or more, round up.	5
When using trial and improvement guess what the answer might be, then improve on it until you get close to the correct answer. A square has an area of 20 cm2. Use a method of trial and improvement to find the length of its side, correct to 1 decimal place (1 d.p. ). Start by trying 4: 4 is too small, so try 5: 4 is too small, and 5 is too big, so the answer lies between 4 and 5. Try 4.5: Try 4.4: Therefore, the answer lies between 4.4 and 4.5, but it is closer to 4.5. So the answer is 4.5cm to 1 d.p. The question asked us to find the length of the side correct to 1 d.p., so you only need to try values with 1 d.p. If, however, the question had asked for values correct to 2 d.p. you would have got a more accurate answer. For example:	5
Rounding 12.756 or 4.543 to 1 decimal place (d.p.) seems sensible, as the rounded figures are very close to the actual value. But what happens if you round a very small number to 1 d.p? This is not a useful answer. Another way to find an approximate answer with very small numbers is to use significant figures. Significant figures start at the first non-zero number, so ignore the zeros at the front, but not the ones in between. Look at the following examples: From the first significant figure onwards, all zeros are included. It's only the zeros at the beginning that don't count. How many significant figures do the following numbers have? a) 0.3007 b) 2.01 c) 0.001023 a) 0.3007 has four significant figures. b) 2.01 has three significant figures. c) 0.001023 has four significant figures.	5
The method for rounding to a given number of significant figures is almost identical to the method used for rounding to a given number of decimal places. You look at the number after the one you're interested in, to see whether it is greater or less than 5. If it's less than 5, round down. If it's 5 or more, round up. Q1. Round 0.0724591 to 3 significant figures (s.f.) Q2. Round 0.2300105 to 4 significant figures (s.f.) A1. To round to three significant figures, look at the fourth significant figure. It's a 5, so round up. Therefore, 0.0724591 = 0.0725 (3s.f.) A2. To round to four significant figures, look at the fifth significant figure. It's a 1, so round down. Therefore, 0.2300105 = 0.2300 (4s.f.) Even though 0.2300 is the same as 0.23, include the zeros to show that you have rounded to 4 significant figures.	5

Decimals play an important part in everyday life - particularly through the use of money - so it's crucial that you know how to use them. This Revision Bite covers: Multiplying by decimals 10, 100 and 1000 Dividing decimals by 10, 100, 1000	5
We use a decimal point to separate units from parts of a whole (like tenths, hundredths, thousandths, etc). In 52.13, the value of the figure 1 is 1/10 , and the value of the figure 3 is 3/100. When ordering numbers, always compare the left digits first. Eg Which is greater, 2.301 or 2.32? Both numbers have two units and three tenths, but 2.301 has no hundredths, whereas 2.32 has two hundredths. Therefore, 2.32 is greater than 2.301. Another way to look at it is to add a zero to the end of 2.32 (this doesn't change its value as it's after the decimal point). The two numbers are now 2.320 and 2.301 and it is quite easy to see that 2.320 is bigger (just as 2 320 is bigger than 2 301). Q1. In the number 3.546, what is the value of the figure 4? Q2. Place the following numbers in order, smallest first: 3.2, 3.197, 3.02, 3.19 A1. The value of the figure 4 is 4/100. A2. Did you get 3.02, 3.19, 3.197, 3.2? All the numbers have three units, so start by comparing the tenths. 3.02 has no tenths, 3.197 and 3.19 have one tenth, and 3.2 has two tenths. Therefore, 3.02 is the smallest and 3.2 is the largest. You could also write the numbers as 3.020, 3.190, 3.197 and 3.200 and compare them.	5
When adding and subtracting decimals, remember is to keep the decimal points in line in the question and the answer. David is doing some DIY. He buys a 2m length of wood. He needs to cut two pieces of wood - one of length 0.6m and one of length 1.02m. What is the total length of wood that David needs to cut? Add 0.6 and 1.02. So the total length of wood that David needs to cut is 1.62m. You can add zeros to the end of a decimal without affecting its value, so 0.6 is the same as 0.60. David originally had 2m of wood. What is the length of the piece of wood that is left? David cut off 1.62m, so we need to calculate 2 - 1.62 So there is 0.38m of wood left.	5
When a decimal is multiplied by 10, every figure moves one place to the left. What is 4.25 x 10? When multiplying by 100, every figure moves two places to the left. What is 0.103 x 100? When multiplying by 1000, every figure moves three places to the left. What is 0.04 x 1000? Which is bigger: 0.005 Ã— 10 or 0.0004 Ã— 1000? The answer is 0.0004 Ã— 1000 If you didn't get it right, remember that multiplying by 10 moves each digit one place to the left. Therefore, 0.005 Ã— 10 = 0.05. Multiplying by 1000 moves each digit three places to the left. Therefore, 0.0004 Ã— 1000 = 0.4. 0.4 is bigger than 0.05.	5
When you divide by 10, every figure moves one place to the right. Hundreds become tens, tens become units, units become tenths and tenths become hundredths. What is 27 divided by 10? When you divide by 100, every figure moves two places to the right. What is 27 divided by 100? When you divide by 1000, every figure moves three places to the right. What is 30 divided by 1000?	5
Multiplying a decimal by a whole number is the same as multiplying two whole numbers. Remember: Calculate: a) There were two digits after the decimal point in the question (4 and 3), so you must have two digits after the decimal point in the answer. b) There was one digit after the decimal point in the question, so you must have one digit after the decimal point in the answer. The answer is therefore 12.0, but this can then be given as 12. Check that you have a sensible answer by finding an approximate solution. In the above example you were asked to calculate 2.4 Ã— 5. 2 Ã— 5 = 10, so you are looking for an answer which is slightly bigger than 10. So an answer of 12 seems sensible.	5
Remember to keep the decimal points aligned in the question and the answer. Work out 4.05 divided by 9 Solution: Work out 2.4 divided by 5 Solution: It is sometimes necessary to add a '0' or '0's to the end of a decimal, as in this example (2.40 is the same as 2.4 but the question stays the same)	5
The multiplication sign can be replaced by 'lots of'. For example, So, 1/2 Ã— 10 means 1/2 of 10 And 1/3 Ã— 12 means 1/3 of 12 When you multiply by a number greater than 1, you get an answer that is greater than the original number. But when you multiply by a number between 0 and 1, the answer is smaller than the original number. m Ã— 1/n = m Ã· n 8 Ã— 1/4 = 8 Ã· 4 = 2 20 Ã— 1/5 = 20 Ã· 5 = 4 Imagine that you had 10 bars of chocolate that you wanted to share amongst some children. If you gave the children 2 bars each, you would have enough for 5 children. 10 Ã· 2 = 5 If you gave the children 1/2 bar each, you would have enough for 20 children. 10 Ã· 1/2 = 20 Can you see what's happening? When you divide by a whole number the answer is less than the original number. When you divide by 1/2 the answer (20) is greater than the original number (10). It's the opposite of multiplying. When we divide by a number greater than 1, we get an answer that is less than the original number. But when we divide by a number between 0 and 1 the answer is larger than the original number. Similarly, 10 Ã· 1/3 = 30 and 10 Ã· 1/4 = 40 Q1. What is 10 Ã· 1/7 ? Q2. Find the value of: 4 Ã· 1/3 A1. 70 A2. 4 Ã· 1/3 = 4 Ã— 3 = 12	5
What can be written in different ways? Fractions!	5
Fractions represent part of a whole number. This Revision Bite covers:	5
If you cut a cake into two equal pieces and eat one of them, you have eaten 1/2 (half) a cake. If a cake is cut into five equal pieces and you eat three of them, you have eaten 3/5 (three fifths) of a cake. 1/2 and 3/5 are examples of fractions - parts of a whole.	5
Cutting the cake into six equal pieces and eating two is equivalent to cutting the cake into three equal pieces and eating one. You eat the same amount of cake in both cases. If the cake is cut into 12 equal pieces, how many will we have to eat in order to have the equivalent of 1/3 of the cake? 1/3 is equivalent to 2/6 because the top and bottom numbers have been multiplied by 2. 4/12 is equivalent to 1/3 because the top and bottom numbers have been divided by 4. When writing equivalent fractions, do the same multiplication or division to the top and bottom numbers. For example, if you multiply the top by 2, you must also multiply the bottom by 2.	5
The factors of a number are those numbers that divide into it exactly. Numbers have common factors if the same number divides into both of them. So 4 is a common factor of both 8 and 12, as it divides into both of them. 2 is a common factor of both 2 and 6, as it divides into both of them. You know that 4/12 = 2/6 = 1/3 4 and 12 have a common factor (4), so 4/12 can be written as 1/3 (divide the top and the bottom by 4). 2 and 6 have a common factor (2), so 2/6 can be written as 1/3 (divide the top and the bottom by 2). However, 1 and 3 have no common factors, so 1/3 cannot be simplified. When a fraction cannot be simplified we say that it is its simplest form.	5
A whole number can be written as 2/2, 3/3, 4/4, etc. So 1 2/3 can be written as 3/3 + 2/3 = 5/3 1 2/3 is known as a mixed number, because it is made up of a whole number and a fraction. 5/3 is called an improper fraction, because the top number is bigger than the bottom number. You can write the whole number part as a fraction, then add the fractions together. 1 2/3 = 3/3 + 2/3 = 5/3 Here is another example: 2 1/4 = 1 + 1 + 1/4 = 4/4 + 4/4 + 1/4 = 9/4 You can separate out the fraction into smaller fractions, like this: 17/5= 5/5 + 5/5 + 5/5 + 2/5 = 3 2/5 Another way to convert an improper fraction is to find how many whole numbers you get, by using a division. For example let's convert 17/5 to a mixed number again. We start by dividing the top number by the bottom number. 17 divided by 5 is 3 remainder 2. So the whole number part is 3, and the remainder 2 means there are 2/5 left over. So the answer is 17/5 = 3 2/5 Write 20/7 as a mixed number. If your calculator has a fraction button you can use this to convert from improper fractions to mixed numbers. Type in the improper fraction, press '=', and the calculator will convert it to a mixed number.	5
Which fraction is bigger, 3/4 or 5/7 ? It is hard to answer this question just by looking at the fractions. However, if you write the fractions with the same bottom number, the question will be easy. 3/4 has a denominator of 4, and 5/7 has a denominator of 7. 4 and 7 both divide into 28, so rewrite the fractions with a denominator of 28. 3/4= 21/28 5/7= 20/28 It is easy to see that 21/28 is bigger than 20/28. Therefore 3/4 is bigger than 5/7. To compare fractions, first write them with the same number at the bottom.	5
It is hard to picture what the answer is if you add 1/2 and 1/3. Rewriting the fractions with a common bottom number (in this case, 6) makes it easier to see the answer. Remember: You can only add and subtract fractions when the bottom numbers are the same. So to add or subtract fractions: 1/2 + 1/3 = 3/6 + 2/6 = 5/6 7/10 - 2/5 = 7/10 - 4/10 = 3/10 What is 1/4 + 1/3 = ? 1/4 + 1/3= 3/12 + 4/12 = 7/12 To add or subtract mixed numbers, it is usually easiest to change them to improper fractions first: 3 1/3 + 4 1/2 = ? 3 1/3 + 4 1/2 = 10/3 + 9/2 = 20/6 + 27/6 = 47/6 = 7 5/6	5
1/2 of 1/2 = 1/2 Ã— 1/2 = 1/4 2/3 of 4/5 = 2/3 Ã— 4/5 = 8/15 Multiply the top and bottom numbers then simplify where necessary. Now put the the answer into its simplest form 6/20= 3/10 When you divide 10 by 2, you are working out how many 2's there are in 10. 10 Ã· 2 = 5, so there are five 2's in 10. In a similar way, when dividing 2 by 1/2, you are working out how many 1/2's there are in 2. There are four 1/2's in 2, so 2 Ã· 1/2 = 4. If you divide 1 1/2 by 1/4 you are working out how many 1/4's there are in 1 1/2 . There are six 1/4's in 1 1/2, so 11/2 Ã· 1/4= 6. Do you see a pattern? Let's write out those calculations a different way. 2 Ã· 1/2 = 4 so 2 Ã· 1/2 is the same as 2 Ã— 2 11/2 Ã· 1/4 = 3/2 Ã· 1/4 = 6 so 3/2 Ã· 1/4 is the same as 3/2 Ã— 4 = 12/2 = 6 To divide fractions, turn the second fraction upside down, then multiply. 3/4 Ã· 4/5= 3/4 Ã— 5/4 = 15/16	5
Fractions, decimals and percentages can all have the same values and you need to know how to convert between them. This Revision Bite covers:	5
If you get 7 out of 10 in a test, you can write your score as 7/10. 7 expressed as a fraction of 10 is 7/10. Similarly, if there are 20 socks in a drawer and 4 of them are blue, 4/20 of the socks are blue. So, 4 expressed as a fraction of 20 is 4/20. We can put this into its simplest form by dividing the top and bottom numbers by 4. So we get 1/5. a) What fraction of the large shape is the small one? b) What fraction of the small shape is the large one? a) The small shape is 3/10 of the large shape. b) The large shape is 10/3 or 3 1/3 of the small shape. If you are expressing a number as a fraction of a second, the first number goes on the top and the second number on the bottom. What fraction of 1 metre is 42cm? Give your answer in its simplest form. 42cm as a fraction of 100cm is 42/100 = 21/50	5
Similarly, 0.4 = 4/10 = 2/5, and 0.125 = 125/1000 = 1/8 Write 0.7 as a fraction in its simplest form 7/10 3/10 means three tenths, so write it as 0.3 17/100 means seventeen hundredths, so write it as 0.17 9/100 = 0.09. When the bottom number isn't a multiple of 10, convert a fraction to a decimal by dividing the top number by the bottom. You might need a calculator to help you.	5
To convert decimals to percentages multiply by 100. Write 0.35 as a percentage. 0.35 Ã— 100% = 35% (0.35 means 35/100, so 0.35 = 35%) Similarly, 0.2 becomes 0.2 Ã— 100% = 20%, and 0.375 becomes 0.375 Ã— 100% = 37.5%. Write the following decimals as percentages: a) 0.34 b) 0.005 a) 34% b) 0.5% If you didn't get the right answers, remember that multiplying by 100 moves every digit two places to the left.	5
You can convert fractions to percentages by first writing them with a denominator of 100. 6/10 is equivalent to 60/100, so 6/10 = 60% 1/4 is equivalent to 25/100, so 1/4= 25% To remind yourself about equivalent fractions have another look at Fractions. Write 3/5 as a percentage 3/5 = 60/100 = 60% (Multiply the top and bottom numbers by 20.) Write 5/8 as a percentage	5
To write one number as a percentage of another, divide the first number by the second, then multiply by 100 Q1. A dress which originally cost Â£80 is reduced by Â£10 in the sale. What percentage reduction is this? Q2. A swimming team has 20 members and 12 of these are boys. What percentage of the swimming team are boys? A1. 10 Ã· 80 = 0.125 0.125 Ã— 100% = 12.5% So the dress has been reduced by 12.5% A2. 12/20 Ã— 100 = 60 So 60% of the team are boys	5
To convert from percentages to decimals or fractions, divide by 100. a) 67/100 = 0.67 b) 5/100 = 1/20	5
It's important that you can multiply and divide without using a calculator. This Revision Bite looks at short division and short multiplication. Have a pen and paper ready to try some of the working-out for yourself. This Revision Bite covers:	5
To multiply 237 by 4 without using a calculator, you can set it out like this: Start with 4 Ã— 7, which is 28, so write the 8 and carry the 2 to the tens column. 4 Ã— 3 = 12, but remember to add the carried 2 to get 14. Write the 4 and carry the 1 to the hundreds column. 4 Ã— 2 = 8, and we add the carried 1 to get 9. Therefore 237 Ã— 4 = 948 This method is called short multiplication.	5
To divide a large number by a 1-digit number you can set it out like this: 7 goes into 9 once with 2 remaining (remainder 2), so put a 1 above the 9 and carry the 2 to the tens column. 7 goes into 26 three times, remainder 5, so put 3 over the 6 and carry 5 to the hundreds column. 7 goes into 54 seven times, remainder 5 so put 7 over the 4 and have a remainder of 5. We write this with an 'r' for 'remainder', so it looks like this: 964 Ã· 7 = 137 Â Â Â r 5 This method is called short division.	5
Want to work out numbers below zero? Have a look at negative numbers.	5
This Revision Bite covers:	5
Any number above zero is a positive number. Positive numbers are written with no sign or a '+' sign in front of them and they are counted from zero to the right. Any number below zero is a negative number. Negative numbers are always written with a '-' sign in front of them and they are counted from zero to the left. Always look at the sign in front of a number to see if it is positive or negative. Positive numbers get higher the further we move right, so 5 is more than 2. Negative numbers get lower the further we move left, so -5 is less than -2. Which word, 'higher' or 'lower', would fit correctly in each of these gaps? a) -7 is ............... than -1 b) + 62 is ............... than -71 c) -136 is ............... than -36 a) -7 is lower than -1 b) + 62 is higher than -71 c) -136 is lower than -36 Now test what you've learnt about negative numbers in the activity below.	5
To add and subtract numbers always begin counting from zero. When dealing with positive numbers count to the right. When dealing with negative numbers count to the left. Calculate 4 - 5 - 3 Imagine moving up and down a number line to get to the answer. Starting from zero, count up to 4. Then subtract 5. Then subtract 3. The answer is -4. Calculate 4 - 5 - 3 Calculate: - 2 + 9 - 10 + 6 If you wrote the answer 3 or +3, then well done! When adding or subtracting negative numbers, remember that when two signs appear next to each other and are different, then you subtract. When two signs are next to each other and they are the same, you add: Calculate: a) 10 + - 7 b) 4 - - 3 a) 10 + - 7 = 10 - 7 = 3 b) 4 - -3 = 4 + 3 = 7	5
The rule for multiplying and dividing is very similar to the rule for adding and subtracting. Calculate: a) 5 Ã— -4 b) -40 Ã· -8 a) We have +5 and -4. The signs are different, so the answer will be negative. So, +5 Ã— -4 = -20 b) We have -40 and -8. The signs are the same, so the answer will be positive. So, -40 Ã· -8 = 5	5
When you are working out a sum with more than one operation (eg 8 +2 Ã— 3), follow the BODMAS rule. Without these rules you could have more than one right answer, so getting the order of operation correct is important. This Revision Bite covers:	5
There is an agreed order of operations in Maths called BODMAS. BODMAS stands for Brackets, Other, Division and Multiplication, Addition and Subtraction All of these terms are fairly obvious except for 'Other', which are just powers (eg 23 or 42 etc.) So the order you should do your calculations in is Brackets, Other, Division and Multiplication Addition and Subtraction What is 4 + 2 Ã— 3? If you calculate the '4 + 2' part first you get: 4 + 2 Ã— 3 = 6 Ã— 3 = 18 If you calculate the '2 Ã— 3' part first you get: 4 + 2 Ã— 3 = 4 + 6 = 10 These are two very different answers, but only one is correct. In BODMAS, multiplication comes before addition, so multiply 2 by 3 first. 4 + 2 Ã— 3 = 4 + 6 = 10, so this is the right answer.	5
Brackets, Other, Division and Multiplication, Addition and Subtraction Try and find the answers to these questions. Q1. Work out the value of the following: d) 8 - (6 - 1) a) In BODMAS multiplication comes before subtraction, so work out the multiplication first and then do the subtraction: 4 Ã— 5 - 3 Ã— 2 = 20 - 6 = 14 b) 20 The working is (2 + 3) Ã— (5 - 1) = 5 Ã— 4 = 20 c) In BODMAS division comes before addition, so 2 + 6 Ã· 2 = 2 + 3 = 5 d) Brackets come first, so 8 - (6 - 1) = 8 - 5 = 3 e) BODMAS states that brackets come before multiplication, so work out the bracket first: 3 Ã— (4 + 2) = 3 Ã— 6 = 18	5
Work out a percentage. Which method will you choose?	5
'Percent' means 'per 100'. If 70 percent of the population own a pet, this means that 70 out of every hundred people own a pet. The symbol '%' means 'percent'. This Revision Bite covers:	5
In this diagram, 30 out of 100 squares have been shaded. So 30% has been shaded. What percentage has been shaded?	5
It's often useful to be able to find a percentage of a quantity. For example, you might be told that bus fares are going up by 5% and you need to know how much more you will need each week. Here are a couple of ways you could do it: Find 1% of the quantity by dividing it by 100. Find x% of a quantity by multiplying 1% of the quantity by x. Rakesh has a box containing 60 pens. 20% of the pens are red. How many is that? You need to find 20% of 60. 1% of 60 is 60 Ã· 100 = 0.6 So 20% of 60 is 0.6 Ã— 20 = 12 Find x% of a quantity by multiplying that quantity by x/100 This combines the division and multiplication of Method 1 into one sum. Q1. In a class of 25 pupils, 24% live in a flat. How many pupils live in a flat? Q2. Last year Sam earned Â£20,000. This year her pay has increased by 8%. a) By how much money has Sam's pay increased? b) What is her new salary? A1. 24% is equivalent to 24/100 24% of 25 = 24/100 Ã— 25 = 6 Therefore 6 pupils live in a flat. A2. a) Method 1: 1% of 20000 = 20000 Ã· 100 = 200 8% of 20000 = 8 Ã— 200 = 1600. b)Therefore, her new salary is: Â£20000 + Â£1600 = Â£21600.	5
What are powers and roots? Find out how they work.	5
Squaring, cubing and higher powers are shown by small digits called indices, like 102 and 53. The opposite of squaring a number is finding the square root, and the same is true for cubing and cube roots. This Revision Bite covers:	5
"9 is a square number. 3 Ã— 3 = 9 3 Ã— 3 can also be written as 32. This is pronounced ""3 squared"". 8 is a cube number. 2 Ã— 2 Ã— 2 = 8 2 Ã— 2 Ã— 2 can also be written as 23, which is pronounced ""2 cubed"". The notation 32 and 23 is known as index form. The small digit is called the index number or power. You have already seen that 32 = 3 Ã— 3 = 9, and that 23 = 2 Ã— 2 Ã— 2 = 8. Similarly, 54 (five to the power of 4) = 5 Ã— 5 Ã— 5 Ã— 5 = 625 and 35 (three to the power of 5) = 3 Ã— 3 Ã— 3 Ã— 3 Ã— 3 = 243. The index number tells you how many times to multiply the numbers together. When the index number is two, the number has been 'squared'. When the index number is three, the number has been 'cubed'. When the index number is greater than three you say that it is has been multiplied 'to the power of'. For example: 72 is 'seven squared', 33 is 'three cubed', 37 is 'three to the power of seven', 45 is 'four to the power of five'. Look at the table and work out the answers. The first has been done for you."	5
All scientific calculators have a 'power' button. This is usually labelled [xy]. This is particularly useful when the index number is large. To work out 4 10: Press = You should get the answer 1 048 576. Use your calculator to find the values of the following:	5
The opposite of squaring a number is called finding the square root. The square root of 16 is 4 (because 42 = 4 Ã— 4 = 16) The square root of 25 is 5 (because 52 = 5 Ã— 5 = 25) The square root of 100 is 10 (because 102 = 10 Ã— 10 = 100) What is the square root of 4? 2 Ã— 2 = 4, so 2 is the square root of 4. The symbol 'âˆš ' means square root, so âˆš 36 means 'the square root of 36', and âˆš 81 means 'the square root of 81' You will also find a square root key on your calculator. The opposite of cubing a number is called finding the cube root. The cube root of 27 is 3 (because 3 Ã— 3 Ã— 3 = 27) The cube root of 1000 is 10 (because 10 Ã— 10 Ã— 10 = 1000) What is the cube root of 8? 2 Ã— 2 Ã— 2 = 8, so 2 is the cube root of 8.	5
How can we work out 23 Ã— 25? There are 3 twos from 23 and 5 twos from 25, so altogether there are 8 twos. The rule also works for other numbers, so If you divide 25 by 23 you see that some of the 2's cancel: In general, 2m Ã· 2n = 2(m - n) The rule also works for other numbers, so	5
How can you write a ratio? Work out some measurements.	5
Ratios are usually written in the form a:b. They are used on maps to show you the scale of the map in relation to real life. This Revision Bite covers:	5
If you are making orange squash and you mix one part orange to four parts water, then the ratio of orange to water will be 1:4 (1 to 4). If you use 1 litre of orange, you will use 4 litres of water (1:4). If you use 2 litres of orange, you will use 8 litres of water (2:8). If you use 10 litres of orange, you will use 40 litres of water (10:40). These ratios are all equivalent 1:4 = 2:8 = 10:40 Both sides of the ratio can be multiplied or divided by the same number to give an equivalent ratio. Write the ratio 40:28 in its simplest form. To work this out, look for a number that will divide into 40 and 28. 2 divides into both numbers, so 40:28 can be written as 20:14. You can divide these by 2, so the simplified ratio is 10:7 No number divides into 10 and 7, so 10:7 is the simplest form of the ratio.	5
Dave and Lisa win Â£500 between them. They agree to divide the money in the ratio 2:3. How much does each person receive? The ratio 2:3 tells us that for every 2 parts Dave receives, Lisa will receive 3 parts. There are 5 parts in total. Â£500 represents 5 parts. Therefore, Â£100 represents 1 part. It's important to notice what order the parts of the ratio are written in. 2:3 is not the same as 3:2. In the example, the ratio of Dave's money to Lisa's was 2:3. If we swap the order to 3:2 then Dave would get more than Lisa. To keep it the same as in the example we could say that the ratio of Lisa's money to Dave's would be 3:2 Q1. Amelia and Shabana win a sum of money, which they agree to share in the ratio 5:3. If Amelia receives Â£150, how much will Shabana receive? Q2. A necklace is made using gold and silver beads in the ratio 3:2. If there are 80 beads in the necklace: a) How many are gold? b) How many are silver? A1. Amelia receives 5 parts, which is equivalent to Â£150. Therefore, Â£150 represents 5 parts. Â£150 Ã· 5 represents one part. So one part is Â£30 Shabana receives 3 parts: 3 Ã— Â£30 = Â£90. A2. Gold : Silver = 3:2, so there are 5 parts altogether. 80 Ã· 5 = 16, so 1 part represents 16 beads. a) Gold = 3 Ã— 16 = 48 beads b) Silver = 2 Ã— 16 = 32 beads	5
Ratios are used in everyday life and can help you work out problems including scale drawings and reading maps. In a scale drawing, all dimensions have been reduced by the same proportion. A model boat is made to a scale of 1:20 (1 to 20). This scale can be applied to any units, so 1mm measured on the model is 20mm on the actual boat, 1cm measured on the model is 20cm on the actual boat, and so on. a) If the 1:20 model boat is 15cm wide, how wide is the actual boat? b) If the boat has a mast of height 4m, how high is the mast on the model? The scale is 1:20. This means that every cm on the model is equivalent to 20cm on the boat. a) 1cm on the model = 20cm on the boat, so: 15cm Ã— 20 = 300cm. 15cm on the model = 300cm (3m) on the boat b) 20cm on the boat = 1cm on the model so mast height on real boat Ã· 20 = mast height on model 400cm (4m) on the boat = 400cm Ã· 20 = 20cm on the model Maps scales can be written in ratios and tell you how many units of land, sea etc are equal to one unit on the map. If you are travelling from Manchester to Newcastle, for example, and need to know how far it is, it would be very difficult to work this out if the map does not have a scale. The scale of a map is 1:50 000. A distance is measured as 3cm on the map. How many cm, m and km is this equivalent to in real life? 1 cm on the map represents 50 000cm. Therefore, 3cm on the map represents 150 000cm. To convert from cm to m, divide by 100. 150 000cm Ã· 100 = 1500m To convert from m to km divide by 1000. 1500m Ã· 1000 = 1.5km The scale of a map is 1:50 000. What distance on the map will represent 5km? First convert 5km to cm 5km = 5000m = 5000 Ã— 100 cm = 500 000cm We want to know what distance on the map represents 500 000cm in real life. The map scale is 1:50 000, so we divide by 50 000 500 000 Ã· 50 000 = 10 Therefore, 5km is equivalent to 10cm on the map.	5
Why not try describing some numbers? Try to understand place values.	5
Numbers are part of everyday life. It is important that you can write and describe them, and carry out simple calculations without using a calculator. This Revision Bite covers: Multiplying by 10, 100, 1000 Dividing by 10, 100, and 1000	5
In the number 3 147 286 the figure 2 has a value of 200 (two hundred), and the figure 3 has a value of 3 000 000 (three million). What is the value of the figure 8 in 3 147 286? The figure 8 has a value of eight tens, or 80.	5
When describing whole numbers, remember the place values of the original digits. However, some digits are 'joined' in their description. For example - when describing the number 35, we do not say 'three tens and five units', but instead describe it by the more common name of 'thirty five'. In the same way the thousands, ten-thousands and hundred-thousands columns are usually described together. Here are some examples. 2 000 is described as 'two thousand' 62 000 is described as 'sixty two thousand', and 162 000 is described as 'one hundred and sixty-two thousand' The number 3 147 286 can be written in words as three million, one hundred and forty seven thousand, two hundred and eighty six. Q1. Describe the numbers 4 235 225 in words. Q2. Write twenty-three thousand and fifty six in figures A1. Four million, two hundred and thirty five thousand, two hundred and twenty five. A2. 23 056	5
When you have a series of large numbers that are not in number order, it is sometimes difficult to make sense of them. Here is a table showing the daily profits of an online music store, written in order of days: If these numbers were put into a place value table, it would be easier to arrange them in order. Look at each column in turn. The figures for Friday and Saturday will be the largest as these have figures in the tens of thousands column. Looking at the thousands column shows that there is a 4 in the thousand column for Saturday and a 0 in the thousands column for Friday. Therefore Saturday has the largest number. Here is the table written in order of days:	5
When we multiply by 10, every figure moves one place to the left. Units become tens, tens become hundreds and hundreds become thousands. What is 23 x 10? When we multiply by 100, every figure moves two places to the left. Units become hundreds, tens become thousands and hundreds become ten-thousands. What is 12 x 100? When we multiply by 1000, every figure moves three places to the left. Units become thousands, tens become ten-thousands, and hundreds become hundred-thousands. What is 7 x 1000?	5
When we divide by 10, every figure moves one place to the right. Thousands become hundreds, hundreds become tens and tens become units. What is 270 divided by 10? When we divide by 100, every figure moves two places to the right. Thousands become tens, hundreds become units, and tens and units become fractions of a unit. What is 1300 divided by 100? When we divide by 1000, every figure moves three places to the right. Thousands become units. Hundreds, tens and units become fractions of a unit. What is 4000 divided by 1000?	5
The properties and dimensions of lines and shapes are discussed here. Polygons, circles, triangles and quadrilaterals are key ones to know.	5
2d shapes are flat. Architects draw 2d shapes to see how a building will look from each side. Quadrilaterals have four sides and four corners. There are different kinds of quadrilaterals, each with different properties. This Revision Bite covers:	5
This table shows the properties of different kinds of quadrilaterals.	5
When architects design buildings they often sketch 2D drawings to show what the building will look like from each side. These drawings are called plans and elevations.	5
Which shapes do you need to remember? Have a look here to find out.	5
3d shapes have 3-dimensions- length, width and depth. Prisms have a constant cross section whereas pyramids have sloping sides that meet at a point. This Revision Bite covers:	5
You should know the names of all the solids below. A prism is a 3D shape which has a constant cross section - both ends of the solid are the same shape and anywhere you cut parallel to these ends gives you the same shape too. A pyramid has sloping sides that meet at a point.	5
Some 3D shapes, like cubes and pyramids, can be opened out and unfolded into a flat shape. The unfolded shape is called the net of the solid. Here are some 3D shapes and their nets. A net has to be able to fold up into the 3D shape. Look at these shapes. All of them are nets of a cuboid. See if you can see why they would fold up into a cuboid. Net of a cuboid (a) Look at these shapes. They are not true nets. See if you can see why they wouldn't fold up into a cube. Net of a cuboid (b)	5
We can use isometric paper to draw 3-D shapes: This 3cm Ã— 3cm Ã— 3cm cube has been drawn using the dots as guides. The vertical lines are always vertical, but the horizontal lines are drawn at angles. Get some isometric paper and try drawing the cube yourself. Use isometric paper to draw a cuboid with a length of 6cm, a breadth of 3cm and a height of 2cm. Click through the slideshow below to see how to draw a cuboid with these dimensions.	5
Can you work out angle types? Sure you can! Note the difference between them here.	5
The four types of angle you should know are acute, obtuse, reflex and right angles. When you are estimating an angle, you should consider what type of angle it is first. This Revision Bite covers:	5
An acute angle is less than 90Â°. A right angle is exactly 90Â°. An obtuse angle is between 90Â° and 180Â° . A reflex angle is greater than 180Â°.	5
To estimate the size of an angle, first think about which quadrant (quarter) of a complete turn it is in. For example, this angle is acute, so it must be between 0Â° and 90Â°. This angle is reflex, so it lies between 180Â° and 270Â°: To be even more accurate think in terms of 45Â° angles: This angle lies somewhere between 90Â° and 135Â°, but seems slightly closer to 135Â°, so you could estimate that it is 120Â° (or something similar).	5
Here's how to draw the angle PQR = 60Â° Place your protractor on the line QR. Ensure that the centre of your protractor is over the point Q. Make a mark at 60Â°. Remove the protractor and join Q to the 60Â° mark. Label this point P. If necessary, mark the angle.	5
When measuring angles, make sure that the centre of the protractor is over the vertex (corner) of the angle and that the base line of the protractor is along one of the lines of the angle. Use the protractor to measure the following angle: Use the protractor to measure the following angle:	5
There are 360Â° in a complete turn. There are 180Â° in half a turn (a straight line). Find the size of angle z: What is the size of angle p? The angles on a straight line add up to 180Â°, so p + 140 = 180. p = 40Â° The angles in a quadrilateral add up to 360Â°. This works for any quadrilateral. Again, you can try this for yourself with a piece of paper!	5
An equilateral triangle has 3 equal sides and 3 equal angles. An isosceles triangle has 2 equal sides and 2 equal angles. What is the size of angle p? This is an isosceles triangle, so both the bottom angles are 'p'. The angles in a triangle add up to 180Â°, so	5
How can you find out about the relationship between circle measurements? With Pi.	5
This Revision Bite will show you how to use pi to find the circumference and area of a circle. Pi is represented by this symbol Ï€ and is the approximate number 3.141592. This Revision Bite covers:	5
For any circle, circumference Ã· diameter = 3.141592....... This number is so special that it is given its own symbol Ï€ (the Greek letter equation). It is impossible to work out an exact value of Ï€ , so approximations are used. These include 3.14, 3.142 and 22/7. All scientific calculators have a Ï€ button. You can use this to make your calculations more accurate. If no calculator is available, or an approximate answer to a calculation involving Ï€ is required, then round Ï€ to 3 (or whatever is suggested).	5
We have already seen that circumference Ã· diameter = Ï€ Therefore, circumference =Ï€ Ã— diameter. This can be written as: The diameter is twice the length of the radius. This formula can be written as: A circle has a diameter of 10cm. Find the length of its circumference. (Use Ï€ = 3.14) Anish and Becky each have a circular pond in their garden. Anish's pond has a diameter of 6m. Becky's pond has a diameter of 3m. Anish says that the circumference of his pond is twice the circumference of Becky's pond. a) Find the circumference of each pond (use Ï€ = 3.14). b) Is Anish's statement correct? a) The circumference of Anish's pond is 18.84m and the circumference of Becky's pond is 9.42m. b) It is clear from the answers to a) that Anish's statement is correct.	5
Here is the formula for the area of a circle: Ï€r2 means Ï€ Ã— r Ã— r. Only the 'r' is squared. Find the area of the following (use Ï€ = 3.14): a) a circle of radius 6cm b) a circle of diameter 10cm a) r = 6cm, so we calculate A = 3.14 Ã— 6 Ã— 6 = 113.04cm2 b) The diameter is 10cm, so the radius is 5cm. We calculate A = 3.14 Ã— 5 Ã— 5 = 78.5cm2 A dartboard has a radius of 20cm. The bullseye in the centre of the board has a radius of 1cm. By calculating the area of the two circles, find the area of materials required to make the dartboard (use Ï€ = 3.14). The area of the materials required is 10990mm2. Remember that the area of the large circle is 3.14 Ã— 20 Ã— 20 = 1256cm2. The area of the small circle is 3.14 Ã— 1 Ã— 1 = 3.14cm2. Therefore, the area of the materials required is 1256 + 3.14 = 1259.14cm2. When calculating the area of a circle, remember to use the radius, not the diameter.	5
For this Revision Bite you will need a pencil, ruler, a pair of compasses and some paper. Follow the instructions for the constructions and then try some for yourself. This Revision Bite covers:	5
If two lines are drawn at right angles to each other, they are said to be perpendicular. A line drawn to cut another line or angle in half is a bisector. The path of a point that moves according to a certain rule is a locus. The plural of locus is loci.	5
Practise this construction until you can do it without looking at the instructions.	5
A cow is tethered to a post with a rope of length 4m. It walks around the post with the rope pulled tight. The cow's path is a circle of radius 4m. The cow's path is known as the locus. The plural of locus is loci.	5
What's the difference between lines that cross or don't cross? Find out right here.	5
You can use intersecting and parallel lines to work out the angles in a triangle. This Revision Bite covers:	5
Intersecting lines are lines that cross each other. Parallel lines are lines that never cross each other - they keep the same distance apart from each other. When two lines intersect, the opposite (X) angles are equal: On parallel lines, alternate (Z) angles are equal: On parallel lines, corresponding (F) angles are equal: On parallel lines, co-interior (C) angles add up to 180Â°: Parallel lines are marked with arrows. Lines of equal length are marked with dashes. In the following diagram, DE is parallel to AC and AB = CB. a) Find the size of angle a. Give a reason for your answer. b) Find the size of angle c. Give a reason for your answer. c) Find the size of angle b. Give a reason for your answer. d) Find the size of angle e. Give a reason for your answer. a) a = 40Â° (corresponding angle to angle at point D) b) c = 40Â° (AB = CB, therefore angle a = angle c) c) b = 100Â° (angles in a triangle add up to 180Â°) d) e = 140Â° (e and c are co-interior angles)	5
Polygons are 2D shapes with straight sides. The sum of the exterior angles of a polygon is 360Â°. The interior and exterior angles of each vertex on a polygon add up to 180Â° This Revision Bite covers:	5
A polygon is any 2D shape with straight sides.	5
The exterior angle at a vertex (corner) of a shape is made by continuing one edge. The exterior angles of a polygon add up to 360Âº. Imagine walking round the outside of the polygon. By the time you get back to where you started you have completed one full turn. So all the corners you turned must add to 360Âº. In this diagram the exterior angles have been given different colours. You can see how they can be put together to make a full circle.	5
The interior angle of a polygon is the angle within the vertex. The interior and exterior angles lie on a straight line. So, for each vertex of a polygon: interior angle + exterior angle = 180Â°	5
We have already seen that the sum of the exterior angles is 360Â° and that the interior and the exterior angles add up to 180Â°. Use this information to find the exterior and interior angles of regular polygons. Find the exterior and interior angle of a regular pentagon. A pentagon has 5 sides and 5 exterior angles, and the exterior angles add up to 360Â°	5
Who worked out a way to find any side of a right angled triangle? Pythagoras!	5
You can use Pythagoras' Theorem to find the length of any of the sides on a triangle. This Revision Bite covers: Right-angled triangles	5
Pythagoras' Theorem states that for all right-angled triangles, 'The square on the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares on the other two sides'. (The hypotenuse is the longest side and it's always opposite the right angle) So for any right-angled triangle the square on the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares on the other two sides. In this triangle a2 = b2 + c2 and angle A is a right angle. Pythagoras' Theorem only works for right-angled triangles, so you can use it to test whether a triangle has a right angle. Which of the following triangles is right-angled? a) a) 82 is greater than 52 + 62, so angle A must be obtuse b) 132 is equal to 52 + 122 so angle P must be a right angle c) 102 is less than 52 + 92 so angle X must be acute So the answer is b.	5
Find the length of BR correct to 1d.p BR2 = 42 + 72 BR2 = 16 + 49 [Find the square root of both sides] BR2 = 65 BR = 8.1cm (1d.p.)	5
You can also use Pythagoras' Theorem to find the length of a side other than the hypotenuse, if you know the length of the hypotenuse and the other side. Find the length of YZ correct to 1d.p. YZ2 + 72 = 82 [Subtract 49 from both sides] YZ2 + 49 = 64 [Find the square root of both sides] YZ2 = 15 YZ = 3.9 cm (1d.p.)	5
You can also use Pythagoras' Theorem to find the distance between two points: A is located at x=2 y=1, B is located x=5 y=5	5
Want to check out some shapes? See if they have any lines of symmetry.	5
You can place a mirror along a line of symmetry and get an exact copy of the original shape. You can also fold along the line and find that one half of the shape will fit exactly into the other. This Revision Bite covers:	5
The dotted line through the middle of the letter A is called a mirror line, because if you place a mirror along it, the shape looks exactly the same as the original. Another name for a mirror line is a line of symmetry. This kind of symmetry can also be called 'reflective symmetry'. Now look what happens when you fold the letter 'A' along some dotted lines. Only in the third example does the folded part of the shape fit exactly over the original part. The dotted line is its line of symmetry.	5
If you cut out a rectangle from a piece of paper, and experiment with it and a mirror, you will soon find that it has just two lines of symmetry - one lengthwise and one widthwise. An equilateral triangle has three lines of symmetry.	5
A rectangle can be rotated about its centre by half a turn. The result looks exactly like the original rectangle. We call this rotational symmetry. A tracing of this star fits the star in exactly five different ways. We say that the star has rotational symmetry of order 5. If a shape only fits into itself once, it has no rotational symmetry. Look at these shapes. How many orders of rotational symmetry do they have?	5
Congruent, translation, rotation and reflection - What do these words have to do with shapes?	5
If a shape is transformed, its appearance is changed. This can be done in a number of ways, including translation, rotation, reflection and enlargement. This Revision Bite covers:	5
Congruent means identical in shape and size. Shapes can be congruent even if one of them has been rotated or reflected. Which shapes are congruent? Shapes A, B, E and G are congruent.	5
To translate a shape, you can move it up or down or from side to side, but do not change its appearance in any other way. When a shape is translated, each of the vertices (corners) must be moved in exactly the same way. Which shapes are translations of triangle A? D and E are translations of triangle A.	5
If you put a piece of paper on a table and place your pen in the middle of it, you can rotate the paper whilst keeping the pen in a fixed position. In doing this you are rotating the paper about its centre. A full rotation (360Â°) of the paper will result in the paper being back in its original position. In both the above examples the centre of rotation was the centre of the rectangle, but what happens when the centre of rotation is outside the rectangle? A rectangle with a point of rotation outside of the shape.	5
If you look in a mirror, you see your own image. You (the object) and your image appear to be the same distance from the mirror. An object and its image are always the same perpendicular distance from the mirror line. (Perpendicular means 'at right-angles to'.) Look at the following examples: Each point and its image are the same distance from the mirror line.	5
When can scale factors and centres change? When you enlarge a shape.	5
This Revision Bite looks at enlargements. The size of an enlargement is described by its scale factor. The position of the enlarged shape is described by the centre of enlargement. This Revision Bite covers:	5
Shapes B, C and D are all enlargements of shape A. However, they are all different sizes and in different positions on the screen. When describing enlargements you must state their size and their position. The size of an enlargement is described by its scale factor. For example, a scale factor of 2 means that the new shape is twice the size of the original. A scale factor of 3 means that the new shape is three times the size of the original.	5
The position of the enlarged shape is described by the centre of enlargement (0). To enlarge the triangle with a scale factor of 2 and centre of enlargement 0, you should do the following: For a scale factor of 2: For a scale factor of 3: Sometimes the centre of enlargement lies on or within the original shape. Look at the following examples: What are the scale factors of enlargement for shapes A) and B)? a) 2 b) 3	5
You already know that the size of an enlargement is described by its scale factor. For example, a scale factor of 2 means that the new shape is twice the size of the original. A scale factor of 3 means that the new shape is three times the size of the original. It therefore follows that a scale factor of 1/2 means that the new shape is half the size of the original. To enlarge the triangle with a scale factor of 1/2 and centre of enlargement 0, do the following: What is the scale factor of enlargement in this diagram? The scale factor of enlargement is 1/3 Remember that OA is 6 units and OA' is 2 units. BC is 3 units and B'C' is 1 unit, so each side on the image is 1/3 of the length of the original shape. Always check which is the object and which is the image, so that you don't confuse the scale factors. For example, a scale factor of 2 might be mistaken for a scale factor of 1/2 , or a scale factor of 3 mistaken for a scale factor of 1/3.	5
This Revision Bite will show you how to construct triangles. To practice this you will need a pencil, some paper, a ruler, a protractor and a pair of compasses. This Revision Bite covers:	5
There are two types of triangle that you might be asked to construct using a ruler and protractor. The first is where you are given two sides and the included angle (SAS). The second is where you are given two angles and the included side (ASA). Do not remove the construction lines when you draw them - they are proof that you constructed the triangle correctly.	5
You might be asked to construct a triangle given 3 sides (SSS). To do this you will need a ruler and compass, but no protractor as you don't know any angles. Remember - don't remove the construction lines.	5
Suppose you were in the middle of nowhere, and there were no signs or landmarks to help you find your way. Would you know how to find your way home? Someone might tell you via phone or radio to 'walk to your left', or 'turn through 60Â° and then start walking', but how would they know which way you were pointing in the first place? One way of describing direction from a point is to use 3-figure bearings. A compass always points north. Bearings are measured from the north line, always in a clockwise direction. So when someone tells you to walk on a bearing of 120Â°, you should face north, turn clockwise through 120Â° and start walking. The angle between the north line and the flight path of the aeroplane is 30Â°. We say that the aeroplane is flying on a bearing of 030Â° from Heathrow Airport. Click 'Play' to see the direction change in the diagram below. Click 'Pause' to see the bearing. Bearings are always described using three figures. So for less than 100Â° put an appropriate number of 0s in front. Eg 020Â°, 037Â°, 002Â°, 007Â°.	5

Want to know about the details that make up all living things? Youâ€™ll find out that they deal with energy, chemical and physical properties. Life processes, cells, health, variation and classification, feeding relationships Solids, liquids and gases, periodic table, pH scale for acids, bases and alkalis Energy, forces, electric currents and magnetism Rock types, astronomy, and the environment	5
Physical and chemical properties are discussed here. Find out about the atoms and particles that make up chemical matter, and the experiments that help you analyse elements.	5
Want to make mix up some acids and bases? Experiment here.	5
Acids, bases, alkalis and metals are found in the laboratory and at home. They can be irritant or corrosive and must be handled carefully. How acid or alkaline a chemical is can be measured on the pH scale, using indicators like litmus and universal indicator. Acids and bases react together to form salts and other products too. This Revision Bite covers:	5
You will have used some dilute acids at school, such as hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid and nitric acid. Their bottles are labelled with the warning symbol for 'irritant'. This means that if any of them makes contact with your skin, it will become red or blistered. You must wash off any spills with plenty of water, otherwise your skin will soon feel as if it is burning. You are unlikely to have used concentrated acids but your teacher might have shown you some experiments with them. This is because concentrated acids are corrosive. They can attack metals and destroy skin if spilled. Laboratory acids are far too dangerous to taste, but you will have swallowed some dilute weak acids. Acids have a sour taste, like vinegar, which contains ethanoic acid, and lemons, which contain citric acid. These are safe to use in food, but they can still hurt if they get into a cut or into your eyes. Other acids you will find at home are carbonic acid in fizzy drinks, tannic acid in tea and ascorbic acid which is vitamin C, found in fruit and vegetables.	5
Bases are substances that react with acids and neutralise them. They are usually metal oxides, metal hydroxides, metal carbonates or metal hydrogen carbonates. Many bases are insoluble - they do not dissolve in water. If a base does dissolve in water, we call it an alkali. Here are two examples: Copper oxide is a base because it will react with acids and neutralise them, but it is not an alkali because it does not dissolve in water. Sodium hydroxide is a base because it will react with acids and neutralise them. It's also an alkali because it dissolves in water. You will have used some strong bases and alkalis at school, such as sodium hydroxide solution. Like acids, their bottles are labelled with the warning symbol for 'irritant'. This means that they will make your skin red or blistered unless you wash off any spills with plenty of water. Alkalis feel soapy when they get on your skin, so it is easy to tell when you have had an accident and must wash your hands. Concentrated alkalis are corrosive. They can attack metals and destroy skin if spilled. They are just as dangerous as concentrated acids, but many people do not realise this. Bases react with oils and fats, so they are often used in strong household cleaners. Drain cleaners and oven cleaners usually contain sodium hydroxide for example. And ammonia is also commonly used in cleaners. Ammonia can be recognised by its choking smell. It is wise to wear gloves when using these substances, otherwise they will react with your skin and burn it. Weak bases and alkalis are found in toothpaste, antacid tablets (to help cure an upset stomach) and baking powder.	5
When an acid is dissolved in water we get an acidic solution, and alkalis make alkaline solutions. If a solution is neither acidic nor alkaline we call it neutral. Pure water is neutral, and so is paraffin. Indicators are substances that change colour when they are added to acidic or alkaline solutions. You can prepare homemade indicators from red cabbage or beetroot juice - these will help you see if a solution is acidic or alkaline. Litmus and universal indicator are two indicators that are commonly used in the laboratory. Litmus indicator solution turns red in acidic solutions and blue in alkaline solutions - and it turns purple in neutral solutions. Litmus paper is usually more reliable, and comes as red litmus paper and blue litmus paper. The table shows the colour changes it can make. Notice how we say 'stays red'. This is better than saying 'nothing' or 'stayed the same', because it tells us the colour we actually see. Universal indicator is a mixture of several different indicators. Unlike litmus, universal indicator can show us exactly how strongly acidic or alkaline a solution is. This is measured using the pH scale. The pH scale runs from pH 0 to pH 14. Universal indicator has many different colour changes, from red for strong acids to dark purple for strong bases. In the middle, neutral pH 7 is indicated by green. These are the important points about the pH scale:	5
A chemical reaction happens if you mix together an acid and a base. The reaction is called neutralisation, and a neutral solution is made if you add just the right amount of acid and base together. Metal oxides and metal hydroxides are two types of bases. For example copper oxide and sodium hydroxide. Here are general word equations for what happens in their neutralisation reactions with acids. Notice that a salt and water are always produced. The mixture usually warms up a little during the reaction, too. The exact salt made depends upon which acid and base were used. Carbonates and hydrogen carbonates are two other types of base. They also make a salt and water when we neutralise them with acid. But this time we get carbon dioxide gas too. The reaction fizzes as bubbles of carbon dioxide are given off. This is easy to remember because we see the word 'carbonate' in the chemical names. These are the general word equations for what happens:	5
A salt is always made when an acid is neutralised by a base. But the exact salt made depends upon which acid and base were used. The name of a salt has two parts: Where does the name potassium nitrate come from? These are the rules for the second part of the name of a salt: Here are word equations for those reactions. How can we make sodium chloride? The first part of the name is 'sodium', so we need a base containing sodium. We could use sodium hydroxide or sodium hydrogen carbonate, for example. The second part of the name is 'chloride', so we need to use hydrochloric acid. Here are word equations for those reactions. It would be very difficult to neutralise the acid in these reactions perfectly exactly. Some acid or base would be left over. So it would not be safe to taste the sodium chloride solution produced.	5
Acids react with most metals and a salt is produced. But unlike the reaction between acids and bases we don't get any water. Instead we get hydrogen gas. This is the general word equation for the reaction: The salt produced depends upon the metal and the acid. Here are two examples: It doesn't matter which metal or acid is used, if there is a reaction we always get hydrogen gas as well as the salt. There is a simple laboratory test to see if a gas is hydrogen. A lighted wooden splint goes pop if it is put into a test tube of hydrogen. This is because the flame ignites the hydrogen, which burns explosively to make a loud sound.	5
Where can you find atoms? Absolutely everywhere. See how they differ in metals and non-metals.	5
Everything is made from atoms, and there are over 100 different types. These are called elements, and they can be divided into the metals and the non-metals. We'll look at their physical and chemical properties in this Revision Bite. This Revision Bite covers: Non-metals Metals v non-metals	5
Everything is made from atoms, including you. Atoms are tiny particles that are far too small to see, even with a microscope. If people were the same size as atoms, the entire population of the world would fit into a box about a thousandth of a millimetre across! We usually imagine atoms as being like tiny balls: To make diagrams simpler we often draw atoms as circles: There are over a hundred different types of atom, and these are called elements. Each element has a special name. For example carbon, oxygen and hydrogen are all elements. Lead and gold are elements too. A piece of pure gold contains only gold atoms. A piece of pure lead contains only lead atoms. Chemical reactions join or split atoms to rearrange them. But they cannot change one element into another element, or anything simpler. A chemical reaction cannot turn lead into gold, becuse it can't change the atoms into different elements.	5
Each element is given its own chemical symbol, like O for oxygen and Cl for chlorine. Chemical symbols are usually one or two letters long, but sometimes three letters are used. Every chemical symbol starts with a capital letter, with the second or third letters written in lower case. For example, Mg is the correct symbol for magnesium, but mg, mG and MG are wrong. Sometimes it is easy to tell which element a symbol stands for. For example, O stands for oxygen and Li stands for lithium. But sometimes the symbol comes from a name for the element that is not an English word.For example, W stands for tungsten (from the word wolfram) and Na stands for sodium (from the word natrium). The reason is that the same chemical symbols are used all over the world, no matter which language is spoken, which makes them most useful.	5
All the different elements are arranged in a chart called the periodic table. The horizontal rows are called periods. The vertical columns are called groups. Elements in the same group are similar to each other. The metals are on the left and the non-metals are on the right. One non-metal, hydrogen, is often put in the middle. The main groups are numbered from 1 to 7 going from left to right, and the last group on the right is group 0. The zig-zag line in this diagram separates the metals, on the left, from non-metals, on the right. Hydrogen is a non-metal but it is often put in the middle. Notice that most elements are metals, rather than non-metals. Each element has its own chemical symbol, made from letters. Remember that you will only find elements in the periodic table and never compounds. So don't try to look for substances like water and copper sulfate in the periodic table, because they are not there.	5
Iron, magnesium and gold are examples of metal elements. All metals have these properties in common: They are shiny, especially when they are freshly cut. They are good conductors of both heat and electricity. They can be bent without breaking (they are malleable). Most metals also have these properties: they are solid at room temperature, except mercury, which is liquid at room temperature they have a high density (they feel heavy for their size) they make a ringing sound when they are hit (they are sonorous) Mercury is the only liquid metal at room temperature. Three metals are magnetic. These are iron, cobalt and nickel. Steel is a mixture of elements but mostly iron, so it is also magnetic. The other metals are not magnetic. You may have to match the use of a metal with a property that makes it suitable for that use. For example, copper is used for electrical wiring because it is a good conductor of electricity, not because it is a good conductor of heat.	5
Oxygen, carbon, sulfur and chlorine are examples of non-metal elements. All non-metals have these properties in common: they are dull (not shiny) they are poor conductors of heat and electricity (they are insulators) they are weak and brittle (they easily break or shatter) Most non-metals have these properties: they have a low density (they feel light for their size) they do not make a ringing sound when they are hit (they are not sonourous) Eleven non-metals are gases at room temperature, including oxygen and chlorine. One non-metal, bromine, is a liquid at room temperature. The other non-metals are solids at room temperature, including carbon and sulfur. Carbon is a solid non-metal element. Pure carbon can exist in two very different forms - diamond and graphite. The table shows some differences between them. Diamond is the hardest natural substance on Earth, but it is also very brittle and will shatter if hit with a hammer. Graphite is unusual because it is a non-metal that conducts electricity.	5
Remember that most elements are metals, rather than non-metals. The table summarises some differences in their properties. Notice that metals and non-metals have opposite properties to each other. It is usually easy to tell metals and non-metals apart, but some tests are more reliable than others For example using a magnet is not a good test to see if an element is a metal. That's because only three metals are magnetic, not all of them.	5
What's the difference in How do the particles in solids, liquids, and gases change? Why does this matter?	5
Solids, liquids and gasses have physical properties. The way they behave is affected by heating and cooling. We will also look at pressure and diffusion in gases. This Revision Bite covers:	5
Substances expand or get bigger when they are heated up. They contract or get smaller when they are cooled down. This property can be useful. The rod is too big to fit through the hole. Materials expanding and contracting can also cause problems. For example, bridges expand in the summer heat and need special joints to stop them bending out of shape. When substances expand or contract, their particles stay the same size. It is the space between the particles that changes: The particles in a solid vibrate more when it is heated, and take up more room. The particles in a liquid move around each other more when it is heated, and take up more room. The particles in a gas move more quickly in all directions when it is heated, and take up more room.	5
If you ride your bike over a bump in the road, you will be pleased that gases exert pressure on the walls of their container. A pumped-up tyre cushions the rider against bumps, but a flat tyre does not. The pressure of the air inside a flat tyre is just too low to do this. The particles in a gas move quickly in all directions, but they don't get far before they bump into each other or the walls of their container. When gas particles hit the walls of their container they cause pressure. The more particles that hit the walls, the higher the pressure. This is why the pressure in a tyre or balloon goes up when more air is pumped in. If a gas is heated up, its particles move around more quickly. They hit the walls of their container harder and more often. This increases the pressure. Sometimes the pressure gets so great that the container bursts. This is why balloons and tyyres burst if you blow them up too much. It's also why deodorant spray cans carry warning signs to tell you not to leave them in the sunshine. If they get too hot they explode.	5
If someone is cooking in the kitchen it doesn't take long for the smell to travel around the house to other rooms. This is because of diffusion. When chemicals, like the smell of perfume or burning toast, are let loose in a room, the particles mix with the air particles. The particles of smelly gas are free to move quickly in all directions. They eventually spread through the whole room. This is called diffusion. You don't have to mix the gases by waving your arms around - it mixes on its own. Diffusion in gases is quick because the particles in a gas move quickly. It happens even faster in hot gases Diffusion can also happen in liquids. This is because the particles in liquids can move around each other, which means that eventually they are evenly mixed. For example if you drop a little bit of paint into a jar of water the colour will spread slowly through the water. This is by diffusion. Diffusion in liquids is slower than diffusion in gases because the particles in a liquid move more slowly. Diffusion does not happen at all in solids because the particles in a solid can only vibrate on the spot, rather than being able to move from place to place.	5
Why not have a look at some chemical reactions? Try you hand at fusing or separating some elements.	5
Compounds are chemicals made from atoms of different elements joined by chemical bonds. They can only be separated by a chemical reaction. A mixture is made from molecules of elements and compounds that are simply mixed together, without chemical bonds. Mixtures can be separated using techniques such as filtration, chromatography, evaporation and distillation. This Revision Bite covers: Metal and non-metal oxides	5
Atoms of different elements can join together in chemical reactions to form compounds. For example hydrogen and oxygen are elements. They react together to form water, a compound. There are countless different ways for the elements to join together, and millions of compounds are known. The properties of compounds are usually very different from the properties of the elements they contain. For example hydrogen and oxygen are both gases at room temperature, but water is a liquid. The reaction between iron and sulfur to make iron sulfide is often used in school to study elements and compounds. Look at the animation to remind you what happens in this reaction. A test tube is filled with a mixture of iron and sulfur. The table compares the properties of iron and sulfur (the two elements), and iron sulfide (the compound). The atoms in a compound are chemically joined together by strong forces called bonds. You can only separate the elements in a compound using another chemical reaction. Separation methods like filtration and distillation will not do this.	5
Remember that an element is one type of atom, like carbon, gold or chlorine. We will look at three ways that atoms can exist. The atoms of some elements do not join up with other atoms. They stay as single atoms. The element helium is like this. Helium is an unreactive gas. Helium atoms do not join up with each other or any other element. When atoms of the same element join together we get a molecule of that element. Oxygen is like this. Two oxygen atoms join together to make an oxyen molecule. Most of the oxygen in the air is in this form. Hydrogen and chlorine also have molecules with two atoms. Some elements have molecules with more than two atoms. Sulfur atoms can make molecules of eight atoms joined together. A compound is made when atoms of different elements join together by chemical bonds. This means that compounds will always exist as molecules, not separate atoms. The diagrams show some molecules of common compounds.	5
"Remember that we use chemical symbols to stand for the elements. For example, C stands for carbon, O stands for oxygen, S stands for sulfur and Na stands for sodium. For a molecule we use the chemical symbols of the atoms it contains to write down its formula. For example the formula for carbon monoxide is CO. It tells you that each molecule of carbon monoxide consists of one carbon atom joined to one oxygen atom. Take care when writing your symbols and formulae. Be careful about when to use capital letters. For example CO means a molecule of carbon monoxide but Co is the symbol for cobalt. The word 'formulae' (""form-u-lee"") is the plural of 'formula'. If we have more than one formula, we don't say formulas, we say formulae. If the molecule contains more than one atom of an element we use numbers to show this. The numbers are written below the element symbol. For example, the formula for carbon dioxide is CO2. It tells you that each molecule has one carbon atom and two oxygen atoms. Take care when writing these formulae. The small number go at the bottom. For example CO2 is correct but CO2 is wrong. Some formulae are more complicated. For example, the formula for sodium sulfate is Na2SO4. It tells you that sodium sulfate contains two sodium atoms (Na2), one sulfur atom (S) and four oxygen atoms (O4). All compounds have a definite composition. Let's look at water as an example. A water molecule always has two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom - it cannot be a water molecule if it has different numbers of these atoms. Its formula is always H2O."	5
"Some metals are very unreactive. That means they do not easily take part in chemical reactions. For example platinum does not react with oxygen in the air, even if it is heated in a Bunsen burner flame. Some metals are very reactive. They easily take part in chemical reactions to make new substances. Magnesium is like this. If it is heated in a Bunsen burner, it ignites and burns with a brilliant white flame. Other metals may be more reactive than magnesium, or in between magnesium and platinum. If we put the metals in order of their reactivity, from most reactive down to least reactive, we get a list called the reactivity series. If you want to learn the reactivity series, you could try making up a mnemonic or silly sentence to help. Here's one - can you do better? ""Pond slime can make aÂ zoo interesting - the long crinkly sort goes purple."""	5
Remember that metals react with oxygen in the air to produce metal oxides, like magnesium oxide. Non-metals react with oxygen in the air to produce non-metal oxides. Here are two examples for the non-metals carbon and sulfur. Carbon burns in air to form carbon dioxide: Sulfur burns in air to form sulfur dioxide: Non-metal oxides such as sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide are responsible for acid rain. They dissolve in the water in the clouds to form acidic solutions. Acid rain damages rocks and buildings, and harms wildlife. There are some important differences between the physical and chemical properties of metal oxides and non-metal oxides. The table shows some of these differences.	5
A mixture is made from different substances that are not chemically joined. For example powdered iron and powdered sulfur mixed together makes a mixture of iron and sulfur. They can be separated from each other without a chemical reaction, in the way that different coloured sweets can be picked out from a mixed packet and put into separate piles. Mixtures have different properties from compounds. The table summarises these differences. Remember that iron and sulfur react together when they are heated to make a compound called iron sulfide. What are the differences between a mixture of iron and sulfur, and iron sulfide? Here are some of them: The mixture can contain more or less iron, but iron sulfide always contains equal amounts of iron and sulfur. The iron and sulfur atoms are not joined together in the mixture, but they are joined together in iron sulfide. The iron and sulfur still behave like iron and sulfur in the mixture, but iron sulfide has different properties from both iron and sulfur. You can separate the iron from the mixture using a magnet but this does not work for iron sulfide.	5
Can you recognise elements, compounds and mixtures? An element contains just one type of atom. A compound contains two or more types of atom joined together. A mixture contains two or more different substances that are not joined together. The different substances in a mixture can be elements or compounds. The table shows some examples. Notice that the different substances in a mixture can be single atoms, molecules of elements or molecules of compounds.	5
The different substances in mixtures are usually easily separated from one another. The method you use depends upon the type of mixture you have. This is good for separating dissolved substances that have different colours, such as inks and plant dyes. It works because some of the coloured substances dissolve in the liquid better than others, so they travel further up the paper. Filtration is good for separating an insoluble solid from a liquid. (An insoluble substance is one that does not dissolve). Sand, for example, can be separated from a mixture of sand and water using filtration. That's because sand does not dissolve in water. This is good for separating a soluble solid from a liquid (a soluble substance does dissolve, to form a solution). For example copper sulfate crystals can be separated from copper sulfate solution using evaporation. Remember that it is the water that evaporates away, not the solution. This is good for separating a liquid from a solution. For example, water can be separated from salty water by simple distillation. This method works because the water evaporates from the solution, but is then cooled and condensed into a separate container. The salt does not evaporate and so it stays behind. This is good for separating two or more liquids from each other. For example, ethanol (alcohol) can be separated from a mixture of ethanol and water by fractional distillation. This method works because the two liquids have different boiling points. Water and ethanol solution is heated.	5
What state are particles in? Find out how they differ between solids, liquids and gases.	5
You can use the idea of particles to explain the properties of solids, liquids and gases.The strength of bonds between particles is different in all three states. It explains why solids cannot flow, and why gases can be compressed. This Revision Bite covers:	5
Steel, plastic and wood are solids at room temperature. Ice is solid water. The particles in a solid have the following characteristics: The table shows some of the properties of solids and why they are like this.	5
Mercury, lemonade and water are liquids at room temperature. The particles in a liquid are: The particles in a liquid can: The bonds in a liquid are strong enough to keep the particles close together, but weak enough to let them move around each other. The table shows some of the properties of liquids and why they are like this.	5
Air, helium and chlorine are gases at room temperature. Water vapour is water as a gas. The particles in a gas are: The particles in a gas can: There are no bonds between the particles in a gas, so they are free to move in any direction. The table shows some of the properties of gases and why they are like this.	5
Liquids and gases do not have a fixed shape. They can flow and fill their containers, but solids cannot. The particle model explains why. Solids cannot flow because their particles are only able to vibrate and cannot move from place to place. Liquids can flow because their particles can move over each other. When water is poured into a glass, the particles of water move over each other and into the corners of the glass. The particles keep on moving over each other as the water takes the shape of the glass. The animation shows how this works. Gases can flow because their particles can move in all directions. When a Bunsen burner is connected to a gas tap and turned on, natural gas flows through the rubber tubing. The particles of natural gas are free to move anywhere inside the tubing, and pressure forces them through the tubing into the Bunsen burner.	5
The table summarises the arrangement and movement of the particles in solids, liquids and gases. It also shows simple diagrams of the arrangement of the particles that you should be able to draw and recognise.	5
How can you work out where something is on the pH scale? By testing the substance.	5
Energy comes from renewable and non-renewable sources. Electrical energy is a measurable force that also creates magnetic fields.	5
How is electricity being used in your house? And what do magnets and batteries have to do with it all?	5
Electric circuits can be series or parallel. You need to know the symbols we use to draw circuit diagrams. An ammeter measures electric current, in amps, by measuring how much charge is flowing in the circuit. A voltmeter measures, in volts, the difference in electrical energy between two points of a circuit. This Revision Bite covers:	5
Have you ever heard a crackle when taking off your jumper? This is caused by tiny electric charges on your clothes. It's called static electricity. Your jumper and shirt get electrically charged as they rub together, and then negative electric charges jump from one to the other. This makes sparks that crackle - you can even see them in a dark room. When electric charges move in a wire, we say that an electric current flows in the wire. It's like the way a current of water flows in a river. For an electric current to flow, we need two things: something to make the electricity flow, such as a battery or power pack a complete path for the current to flow in. This is called an electric circuit. An electric current will not flow if we do not have a power source (a cell, battery or power pack). It also won't flow if the circuit is not complete. One end of the power source must be joined to the other end by the wires and components of the circuit. The simplest complete circuit is a piece of wire from one end of a battery to the other. An electric current can flow in the wire from one end of the battery to the other, but nothing useful happens. The wire just gets hot and the battery goes flat. To do something useful with the electric current, we need to put an electrical component into the circuit, such as a lamp or motor, that can use the current to make something happen. We usually add in a switch to the circuit, so that we can break the circuit and stop the electric current when we want to.	5
We use circuit symbols to draw diagrams of electrical circuits, with straight lines to show the wires. The diagram shows some common circuit symbols. Notice the difference between the symbol for a cell and the symbol for a battery? The battery is made from joining cell symbols together. Think of what we usually call a single battery, like the type you put in a torch. In physics, each of these is actually called a cell - it is only when you have two or more of these cells connected together that you call it a battery. The idea of a circuit diagram is to use circuit symbols instead of drawing each component in the circuit. Always try to make the wires straight lines, and don't be tempted to make them wiggly. The whole point is to make it easier to see what is connected to what. Here you can see how the symbols for a cell (not a battery!) and a lamp look in a circuit diagram. If you have to draw a circuit diagram from scratch, it is usually easier to draw the circuit symbols first, and then add all the wires. If you have to draw wires to join circuit symbols that are already shown, use a ruler and don't let the wires cross each other.	5
There are two types of circuit we can make, called series and parallel. The components in a circuit are joined by wires. if there are no branches then it's a series circuit if there are branches it's a parallel circuit In a television series, you get several episodes, one after the other. A series circuit is similar. You get several components one after the other. If you follow the circuit diagram from one side of the cell to the other, you should pass through all the different components, one after the other, without any branches. If you put more lamps into a series circuit, the lamps will be dimmer than before. In a series circuit, if a lamp breaks or a component is disconnected, the circuit is broken and all the components stop working. Series circuits are useful if you want a warning that one of the components in the circuit has failed. They also use less wiring than parallel circuits. In parallel circuits different components are connected on different branches of the wire. If you follow the circuit diagram from one side of the cell to the other, you can only pass through all the different components if you follow all the branches. In a parallel circuit, if a lamp breaks or a component is disconnected from one parallel wire, the components on different branches keep working. And, unlike a series circuit, the lamps stay bright if you add more lamps in parallel. Parallel circuits are useful if you want everything to work, even if one component has failed. This is why our homes are wired up with parallel circuits.	5
You need to know how to measure current and voltage. Current is a measure of how much electric charge flows through a circuit. The more charge that flows, the bigger the current. Current is measured in units called amps. The symbol for amps is A. For example, 20A is a bigger current than 5A. A device called an ammeter is used to measure current. Some types of ammeter have a pointer on a dial, but most have a digital readout. To measure the current flowing through a component in a circuit, you must connect the ammeter in series with it. Voltage is a measure of the difference in electrical energy between two parts of a circuit. The bigger the difference in energy, the bigger the voltage. Voltage is measured in volts. The symbol for volts is V. For example, 230V is a bigger voltage than 12V. Voltage is meaured using a voltmeter. Some types of voltmeter have a pointer on a dial, but most have a digital readout. To measure the voltage across a component in a circuit, you must connect the voltmeter in parallel with it. You can measure the voltage across a cell or battery. The more cells, the bigger the voltage.	5
The current is the same everywhere in a series circuit. It does not matter where you put the ammeter, it will give you the same reading. The current in a series circuit depends upon the number of cells. The more cells you add, the greater the current. You might think that the current gets less as it flows through one component after another. But it is not like this. The current is not used up by the components in a circuit. This means that the current is the same everywhere in a series circuit, even if it has lots of lamps or other components.	5
What do the words kinetic, stored and thermal have in common? They are all types of energy.	5
Energy can be transferred from one place to another in many different forms. We'll also see what renewable and non-renewable sources are and how energy is generated from them. This Revision Bite covers: Non-renewable	5
Energy can be stored or transferred from place to place in different ways. Let's look at some examples. Moving things have kinetic energy. The heavier a thing is and the faster it moves the more kinetic energy it has. All moving things have kinetic energy, even very large things, like planets, and very small ones, like atoms. A vibrating drum and a plucked guitar string transfer energy to the air as sound. Kinetic energy from the moving air molecules transfers the sound energy to your eardrum. Thermal energy is what we call energy that comes from heat. A cup of hot tea has thermal energy in the form of kinetic energy from its particles. Some of this energy is transferred to the particles in cold milk, which you pour in to make the tea cooler. Some chemical reactions release energy. For example, when an explosive goes off, chemical energy stored in it is transferred to the surroundings as thermal energy, sound energy and kinetic energy. A battery transfers stored chemical energy as electrical energy in moving charges in wires. For example, electrical energy is transferred to the surroundings by the lamp as light energy and thermal energy. A rock on a mountain has stored energy because of its position above the ground and the pull of gravity. This energy is called gravitational potential energy. This is the energy it would release if it fell. As the rock falls to the ground, the gravitational potential energy is transferred as kinetic energy.	5
"Energy transfer diagrams show the locations of energy stores and energy transfers. For example, consider the energy transfers in the simple electrical circuit below. We can show the transfers like this: The battery is a store of chemical energy. The energy is transferred by electricity to the lamp, which transfers the energy to the surroundings by light. These are the useful energy transfers - we use electric lamps to light up our rooms. But there are also energy transfers that are not useful to us. In the example above, the lamp also transfers energy to the surroundings by heating. If we include this energy transfer, the diagram looks like this: Sankey diagrams summarise all the energy transfers taking place in a process. The thicker the line or arrow, the greater the amount of energy involved. This Sankey diagram for the lamp shows that it transfers most of the energy by heating, rather than by light: Notice that the total amount of energy transferred to the surroundings is the same as the amount of electrical energy. We say that the energy has been conserved. Energy is always conserved, it is never ""lost"" or ""wasted"", although some energy transfers are useful and some are not."	5
Heat and temperature are not the same thing, although both are concerned with thermal energy. The heat an object contains is the amount of its thermal energy, measured in joules or J. The temperature of an object is to do with how hot or cold it is, measured in degrees Celsius. Note that the unit of temperature is written as Â°C, (not Â°c or oC). Let's look at two examples to see the difference between heat and temperature. A swimming pool at 30Â°C is at a lower temperature than a cup of tea at 80Â°C. But the swimming pool contains more water, so it stores more thermal energy than the cup of tea. To boil water we must increase its temperature to 100Â°C. It takes longer to boil a large beaker of water than a small beaker because the large beaker contains more water and needs more thermal energy to reach 100Â°C.	5
Thermal energy can be transferred by: When a substance is heated, its particles gain energy and vibrate more vigorously. The particles bump into nearby particles and make them vibrate more. This passes the thermal energy through the substance by conduction, from the hot end to the cold end. This is how the handle of a metal spoon soon gets hot when the spoon is put into a hot drink. Substances that allow thermal energy to move easily through them are called conductors. Metals are good conductors of thermal energy. Substances that do not allow thermal energy to move through them easily are called insulators. Air and plastics are insulators. The particles in liquids and gases can move from place to place. Convection happens when particles with a lot of thermal energy in a liquid or gas move, and take the place of particles with less thermal energy. Thermal energy is transferred from hot places to cold places by convection. All objects transfer thermal energy by infrared radiation. The hotter an object is, the more infrared radiation it gives off. No particles are involved in radiation, unlike conduction and convection. This means that thermal energy transfer by radiation can even work in space, but conduction and convection cannot. Radiation is how we can feel the heat of the Sun, even though it is millions of kilometres away in space. Infrared cameras give images even in the dark, because they are detecting heat, not visible light. Conduction and convection need moving particles to transfer the thermal energy, but radiation does not.	5
We get energy from many different types of energy resources, including fuels, food and stores of energy such as batteries or the wind. We can divide energy resources into two categories: non-renewable and renewable. Non-renewable energy resources cannot be replaced once they are all used up. Renewable energy resources can be replaced, and will not run out. On the this page we'll look at non-renewable resources. Coal, oil and natural gas are called fossil fuels. They formed millions of years ago from the remains of living things. Coal was formed from plants. Oil and natural gas were formed from sea creatures. The energy stored in the fossil fuels originally came from sunlight. Plants used light energy from the Sun for photosynthesis to make their chemicals. This stored chemical energy was transferred to stored chemical energy in animals that ate the plants. When the living things died, they were gradually buried by layers of rock. The buried remains were put under pressure and chemical reactions heated them up. They gradually changed into the fossil fuels. When the remains of the plants and animals became fossil fuels, their chemical energy was stored in the fuels. The energy is transferred to the surroundings as thermal energy and light energy when the fuels burn. Once we have used them all up, they will take millions of years to replace, if they can be replaced at all. For this reason we call fossil fuels non-renewable energy resources.	5
Renewable energy resources can be replaced, and will not run out. Be careful - it is not true to say that they can be re-used. Biomass fuels come from living things. Wood is a biomass fuel. As long as we continue to plant new trees to replace those cut down, we will always have wood to burn. Just as with the fossil fuels, the energy stored in biomass fuels came originally from the Sun. Wind is caused by huge convection currents in the Earth's atmosphere, driven by heat energy from the Sun. The moving air has huge amounts of kinetic energy, and this can be transferred into electrical energy using wind turbines. Wind turbines cannot work if there is no wind, or if the wind speed is so high it would damage them. Moving water has kinetic energy. This can be transferred into useful energy in different ways. For example: tidal barrages are built across the mouths of rivers. As water moves in or out of the river mouth when the tide turns, the kinetic energy in the water is used to turn electricity generators. Hydroelectric power (HEP) schemes store water high up in dams. The water has gravitational potential energy which is released when it falls. As the water rushes down through pipes, this stored energy is transferred to kinetic energy, which turns electricity generators. In some places the rocks underground are hot. Deep wells can be drilled and cold water pumped down. The water runs through fractures in the rocks and is heated up. It returns to the surface as hot water and steam, where its energy can be used to drive turbines and electricity generators Solar cells are devices that convert light energy directly into electrical energy. You may have seen small solar cells on calculators. Larger arrays of solar cells are used to power road signs, and even larger arrays are used to power satellites in orbit around Earth. Solar panels are different to solar cells. Solar panels do not generate electricity. Instead they heat up water directly. A pump pushes cold water from a storage tank through pipes in the solar panel. The water is heated by heat energy from the Sun and returns to the tank. They are often located on the roofs of buildings where they can receive the most sunlight.	5
Electricity can be generated in many ways, including: Most of the UK's electricity is generated in power stations using fossil fuels. Thermal energy released from the burning fuel is used to boil water to make steam, which expands and turns turbines. These drive the generators to produce electricity. As the fossil fuels are non-renewable energy resources, and they also produce pollution when they burn, we are aiming to produce more of our electricity using other, renewable energy resources. This will reduce the rate at which the fossil fuels are used up. We can also reduce the rate at which the fossil fuels are used up by saving energy. For example, we can:	5
What can't we see? Forces. But, we can measure them and see their effects.	5
Forces can change the shape of objects and change the way they are moving. Weight, pressure and turning moments are all the result of forces too. This Revision Bite covers: What are forces? Weight, mass and gravity	5
A force can be a push or a pull. For example, when you push open a door you have to apply a force to the door. You also have to apply a force to pull open a drawer. You cannot see a force but often you can see what it does. Forces can change the speed of something, the direction it is moving in or its shape. For example, an elastic band gets longer if you pull it. Forces can be measured using a force meter. Force meters contain a spring connected to a metal hook. The spring stretches when a force is applied to the hook. The bigger the force applied, the longer the spring stretches and the bigger the reading. The unit of force is called the newton, and it has the symbol N. So 100 N is a bigger force than 5 N.	5
"People often confuse mass and weight. Remember that weight is a force, and is measured in newtons. Mass is measured in kilograms (kg). The mass of an object is the amount of matter or ""stuff"" it contains. The more matter an object contains, the greater its mass. An elephant contains more matter than a mouse, so it has a greater mass. Mass is measured in kilograms, kg, or grams, g. A 100 kg object has a greater mass than a 5 kg object. Remember an object's mass stays the same wherever it is. All objects have a force that attracts them towards each other. This is called gravity. Even you attract other objects to you because of gravity, but you have too little mass for the force to be very strong. Gravitational force increases when: Gravity only becomes noticeable when there is a really massive object like a moon, planet or star. We are pulled down towards the ground because of gravity. The gravitational force pulls in the direction towards the centre of the Earth. Weight is a force caused by gravity. The weight of an object is the gravitational force between the object and the Earth. The more mass the object has the greater its weight will be. Weight is a force, so it's measured in newtons. On the surface of the Earth an object with a mass of 1 kg has a weight of about 10 N. Remember that mass is measured in kilograms, kg, and weight is measured in newtons, N. The mass of an object stays the same wherever it is, but its weight can change. This happens if the object goes somewhere where gravity is stronger, or weaker, such as the Moon. The Moon has less mass than the Earth, so its gravity is less than the Earth's gravity. This means that objects weigh less on the Moon than they do on the Earth. The Moon's gravity is one sixth of the Earth's gravity. A 120 kg astronaut weighs 1200 N on Earth. On the Moon they would weigh only 200 N. The astronaut's mass is 120kg wherever they are. Remember: a mass of 1kg has a weight of about 10N on Earth."	5
You may get told off if you swing around on one leg of a chair instead of sitting properly. Apart from the risk that you will damage the chair or hurt yourself, the chair leg can damage the floor. This is because it puts too much pressure on the floor. To work out pressure, we need to know two things: the area over which the force or weight works. This is the equation for working out pressure: pressure = force Ã· area A force of 20 N acted over an area of 2 m2 (two square metres). What is the pressure? force Ã· area = pressure Notice that the unit of pressure here is N/m2 (newtons per square metre). Sometimes you will see another unit being used. This is called the pascal, Pa. 1 Pascal = 1 N/m2, so in the example above the pressure is 10 Pa. Drawing pins have a large round end for you to push. The round end has a large area, so it applies a low pressure to your thumb. The sharp end has a very small area. The same pushing force produces a high pressure there, so it pushes into the notice board. If you swing round on one leg of a chair, you put four times as much pressure on one point of the floor as you do if you sit properly. This is because four chair legs spread the pressure over four times more area than one chair leg can.	5
We can show the forces acting on an object using a force diagram. In a force diagram, each force is shown as a force arrow. An arrow shows: the size of the force (the longer the arrow, the bigger the force) the direction in which the force acts. The arrow is usually labelled with the name of the force and its size in newtons. Text books often show a force with a thick coloured arrow, but it is best if you just use a pencil and ruler to draw an arrow with a single line. When two forces acting on an object are equal in size but act in opposite directions, we say that they are balanced forces. If the forces on an object are balanced (or if there are no forces acting on it) this is what happens: So notice that an object can be moving even if there are no forces acting on it. Here are some examples of balanced forces. The forces on this hanging crate are equal in size but act in opposite directions. The weight pulls down and the tension in the rope pulls up. Objects float in water when their weight is balanced by the upthrust from the water. The object will sink until the weight of the water it pushes out of the way is the same as the weight of the object. When an object rests on a surface such as the ground, its weight is balanced by the reaction force from the ground. The ground pushes up against the object. The reaction force is what you feel in your feet as you stand still. Without this balancing force you would sink into the ground.	5
When two forces acting on an object are not equal in size, we say that they are unbalanced forces. If the forces on an object are unbalanced this is what happens: The size of the overall force acting on an object is called the resultant force. If the forces are balanced, this is zero. In the example above, the resultant force is the difference between the two forces, which is 100 - 60 = 40 N.	5
Whenever an object moves against another object, it feels frictional forces. These forces act in the opposite direction to the movement. Friction makes it harder for things to move. Friction can be useful: Frictional forces are much smaller on smooth surfaces than on rough surfaces, which is why we slide on ice. Friction can also be unhelpful. If you don't lubricate your bike regularly with oil, the friction in the chain and axles increases. Your bike will be noisy and difficult to pedal. When there is a lot of friction between moving parts, energy is lost to the surroundings as heat. Think of what happens when you rub your hands together quickly. The friction warms them up. Bikes, cars and other vehicles experience air resistance as they move. Air resistance is caused by the frictional forces of the air against the vehicle. The faster the vehicle moves, the bigger the air resistance becomes. The top speed of a vehicle is reached when the force from the cyclist or engine is balanced by air resistance. Racing cyclists crouch down low on their bikes to reduce the air resistance on them. This helps them to cycle faster. They also wear streamlined helmets. These have special, smooth shapes that allow the air to flow over the cyclist more easily. Modern cars are also streamlined. Their smooth shapes make the air resistance smaller, which allows them to travel further on the same amount of fuel.	5
Forces can make objects turn if there is a pivot. Think of a playground see-saw. The pivot is the thing in the middle of it. When no-one is on the see-saw it is level, but it tips up if someone gets onto one end. Turning forces around a pivot are called moments. It is possible to balance the see-saw again if someone else gets onto the other end and sits in the correct place. This is because the turning forces are balanced. We say the moments are equal and opposite. To work out a moment, we need to know two things: the distance from the pivot that the force is applied. This is the equation for working out a moment: Imagine that a force of 10 N acted on a see-saw 2 m from the pivot. This is how we would work out the moment: force Ã— distance = moment Notice that the unit of moment is Nm (newton metre). Don't get confused with a 'newton meter', which is another name for a forcemeter. Here is an example of balanced moments. 10N at 2m from the pivot is balancing 20N at 1m from the pivot. The objects create moments of 20Nm that are equal and opposite, so the see-saw is balanced. A see-saw will balance if the moments on each side of the pivot are equal. This is why you might have to adjust your position on a see-saw if you are a different weight from the person on the other end. If a nut is difficult to undo with a short spanner, a longer spanner will help. This is because there will be a bigger moment on the nut, when the same force is applied further from the pivot. Using the same principle you can increase the moment applied by a lever or a crowbar, and this can help you move heavy objects more easily.	5
How does electricity influence magnetism? It can make them more powerful.	5
Electric current can cause a magnetic field, which is how electromagnets work. Electric current can also heat things, and cause chemical reactions, like in electrolysis. This Revision Bite covers:	5
Before we look at electromagnets let's recap bar magnets. Bar magnets are permanent magnets. This means that their magnetism is there all the time and cannot be turned on or off. They have two poles: The north pole is normally shown as N and the south pole as S. Magnets are made from magnetic materials. These are metals that can be magnetised or will be attracted to a magnet. Most materials are not magnetic, but iron, cobalt and nickel are magnetic. Steel is mostly iron, so steel is magnetic too. If you bring two bar magnets together, there are two things that can happen: if you bring a north pole and a south pole together, they attract and the magnets may stick together if you bring two north poles together, or two south poles together, they repel and the magnets push each other away. We say that unlike poles attract, and like poles repel. How can you test if a piece of metal is a magnet. Seeing if it sticks to a magnet is not a good test, because unmagnetised iron, steel, cobalt and nickel objects will be attracted to either pole of a magnet. So you can't test for what it is attracted to. But you can test what it repels: Keyfact: You can only show that an object is a magnet if it repels a known magnet.	5
Before we look at electromagnets let's recap magnetic fields. Magnets create magnetic fields. These cannot be seen. They fill the space around a magnet where the magnetic forces work, where they can attract or repel magnetic materials. Although we cannot see magnetic fields, we can detect them using iron filings. The tiny pieces of iron line up in a magnetic field. It would be difficult to draw the results from the sort of experiment seen in the photograph, so we draw simple magnetic field lines instead. In the diagram, note that: The magnetic field is strongest at the poles, where the field lines are most concentrated.	5
When an electric current flows in a wire it creates a magnetic field around the wire. By winding the wire into a coil we can strengthen the magnetic field. Electromagnets are made from coils like this. We can make an electromagnet stronger by doing these things: increasing the current flowing through the coil. The magnetic field around an electromagnet is just the same as the one around a bar magnet. It can, however, be reversed by turning the battery around. Unlike bar magnets, which are permanent magnets, the magnetism of electromagnets can be turned on and off just by closing or opening the switch.	5
Many objects around you contain electromagnets. They are found in electric motors and loudspeakers. Very large and powerful electromagnets are used as lifting magnets in scrap yards to pick up, then drop, old cars and other scrap iron and steel. Electric bells like the ones used in most schools also contain an electromagnet. When the current flows through the circuit, the electromagnet makes a magnetic field. The electromagnet attracts the springy metal arm. The arm hits the gong, which makes a sound. The circuit is broken now the arm is out of position. The electromagnet is turned off and the springy metal arm moves back. The circuit is complete again. The cycle repeats as long as the switch is closed. Check your understanding of this with the animation.	5
Household wires and cables transfer electricity very efficiently. That means they donâ€™t lose much of the energy as heat on the way. The electricity flows freely from the plug and is transferred into other forms of energy in household appliances, like toasters, lights and CD players. The heating element in a toaster is made from a special wire different to wire in the power cables. The wire in the heating element transfers lots of its electrical energy into thermal energy and gets very hot. Exactly what you need to make toast or run an electric heater. In most uses of electricity we don't want to produce heat. Any heat that is produced is wasted energy. Appliances that transfer less of the electricity they use into wasted heat are more energy efficient. For example energy efficient light bulbs transfer less of their energy into heat. They also use less energy than normal bulbs to produce the same amount of light. So the energy efficient light bulb wastes less energy.	5
Electrical energy can cause chemical reactions. This happens in a chemical process called electrolysis. One use for electrolysis is to break down water (H20) into hydrogen (H2) and oxygen (02). Pieces of metal, called electrodes, are placed in the water. A little sulfuric acid is added to the water to make the process work. The electrodes are connected to a battery. The water completes the circuit between the electrodes and current flows. Where the electrodes come into contact with the water chemical changes take place, producing bubbles of gas. Oxygen at one electrode and hydrogen at the other one. This electrolysis produces twice as much hydrogen as oxygen. They are both useful gases used in many chemical processes in industry.	5

Fancy a bit of space exploration? Check out some solar system facts here.	5
The solar system contains planets, their satellites, asteroids and comets. The planets orbit the Sun and take different amounts of time to do this. We have night and day on Earth because the Earth spins on its axis. The tilt of the Earth's axis causes the seasons to change as we orbit the Sun in one Earth year. This Revision Bite covers:	5
The universe contains over 100 billion galaxies. A galaxy is a group of billions of stars. Our own galaxy is called the Milky Way, and it contains about 300 billion stars (300,000,000,000) and one of these is our Sun. Planets and other objects go round the Sun, and these make up the solar system, with the Sun at the centre. The solar system contains different types of objects including: a star - the Sun planets, which go around the Sun satellites, which go around planets There are eight planets in the solar system. Starting with Mercury, which is the closest to the Sun, the planets are: If you can't remember the correct order, try this sentence, or make one up of your own: Scientists have discovered other objects orbiting the Sun. These include comets, asteroids and dwarf planets, like Pluto and Eris. Pluto used to be considered the ninth planet in our solar system. But in 2006 scientists renamed it as a dwarf planet. So now we have 8 planets in the solar system. People used to think that the Earth was at the centre of the universe, with everything going around it. We now know that this is not correct. Scientific observations and space exploration show that the Sun is at the centre of our solar system. The Earth and other planets go around it. We say that the planets are in orbit around the Sun. This model is called the heliocentric model. (Helios is the ancient Greek word for Sun.)	5
All objects are attracted towards each other by a force called gravity. Gravity only becomes noticeable when there is a really massive object like a star, planet or moon. You can find out more about gravity in the Revision Bite called Forces. Gravitational forces between the Sun and planets keep the planets in orbit around the Sun. Without these forces, the planets would fly off into deep space. Their orbits are slightly squashed circles called ellipses. Diagrams often show the orbits as very squashed, but this is just to get a sense of perspective and to fit the diagrams onto the page. The planets furthest out are also the coldest because they receive the least heat energy from the Sun. Planets that are further from the Sun: For example, Mercury, the closest planet to the Sun, takes just 88 Earth days to complete an orbit. But Neptune, the furthest out, takes 164 Earth years to complete an orbit. The graph shows the distances of the planets from the Sun and the time it takes them to orbit once around it. The shape of the curve shows that the further out a planet is the longer it takes to orbit the Sun.	5
"The planets spin as they orbit the Sun. It takes the Earth 24 hours to make one complete turn on its axis, so an Earth day is 24 hours long. Different planets take different amounts of time to make one complete turn, so they have different lengths of day. The Sun lights up one half of the Earth, and the other half is in shadow. As the Earth spins we move from shadow to light and back to shadow and so on. It is daytime in the UK when our part of the planet is in the lit by the Sun. And it is night-time in the UK when our part of the planet is facing away from the Sun. During the day, the Sun appears to move through the sky. Remember that this happens because the Earth is spinning on its axis. In the UK if we look south and follow the path of Sun in the sky during the day, it looks like this: The Sun appears to move from east to west. That's because the Earth is spinning towards to the east, so we see the Sun first appear there at the start of the day. The Sun 'rises' in the east and 'sets' in the west. One way to remember which way the Earth turns is to remember ""w.e. spin"", which means the Earth spins from west to east. During the night, we cannot see the Sun. But the Earth is still spinning on its axis. This means that the stars appear to move from east to west in the sky, just as the Sun does in the day."	5
A planet's year is the time it takes to make one complete orbit around the Sun. The Earth goes once round the Sun in one Earth year. That's 365 Earth days. We've seen already that that different planets take different lengths of time to orbit the Sun. That means their years are different lengths. Mercury has a year of just 88 Earth days, and Neptune has a year of 164 Earth years. The Earth's axis is the imaginary line through the centre of the Earth between the South and North poles. This axis is tilted slightly compared to the way the Earth orbits the Sun. We get different seasons (winter, spring, summer and autumn) because the Earth is tilted. This is how it works: When the northern hemisphere is tilted towards the Sun it is summer in the UK. When the northern hemisphere is tilted away from the Sun it is winter in the UK. When it is summer in the northern hemisphere, it is winter in the southern hemisphere. Because of the tilt of the Earth's axis the Sun moves higher in the sky in summer, when we tilt towards it, than in winter.	5
The Moon orbits the Earth, so it is called a satellite of Earth. The Moon is a natural satellite. No-one built it or launched it into space. Gravitational forces between the Moon and the Earth keep the Moon in orbit. The Moon does not produce light. But it does reflect light from the Sun, which is how we are able to see it from Earth. (Only stars produce light and they are called luminous for that reason.) It takes the Moon 28 days to make a complete orbit of the Earth. As it orbits, we see the Moon lit from different angles. This is why we see phases of the Moon. Sometimes the Moon looks like a full circle. That is called a 'full Moon'. At other times we see a crescent shaped Moon, because we can only see the edge of the part that is lit by the Sun. Remember that we can only see the part of the Moon that reflects the Sun's light. How much of that we can see depends upon the position of the Moon in its orbit. This slideshow shows the phases of the Moon, as seen from the Earth. A common mistake is to think that the phases of the Moon happen because the Earth gets in the way, and casts its shadow onto the Moon. That is not how the phases are caused. However sometimes it does happen that the Earth's shadow falls on the Moon. Then we get an eclipse of the Moon. The whole Moon goes from full, to dark, and back again to full, in the course of a few hours.	5
Artificial satellites are built by people and launched by rockets into space, where they orbit around the Earth. These are some of the things that artificial satellites are used for: communications, including broadcasting television programmes and relaying telephone calls Global Positioning System (GPS) and Galileo satellites for navigation scientific surveys of the Earth's surface Some satellites are used to collect information about the planets and stars. The Hubble Space Telescope can see further into space than telescopes based on the ground. Its view is not blocked by clouds and it doesn't have to wait for night-time. However, it is difficult and expensive to launch and maintain. If anything goes wrong, only astronauts can fix it. Space probes do not orbit the Earth. Instead, they travel to other planets to collect scientific information. Some space probes go into orbit around other planets, some land on them, and some even journey out of the solar system. People have flown to the Moon and landed on it. But so far that is the furthest people have travelled from Earth. It takes years to travel to other planets, like Mars, and people have not done this yet.	5
What's happening to our environment? And how do creatures adapt to it?	5
This Revision Bite is about the relationships between organisms and the environments they live in. This Revision Bite covers:	5
Most habitats do not stay the same all the time. change from light and heat to dark and cold, as night falls change from a high water level to a low water level, as the tide changes change from lots of vegetation in the summer to bare trees and snow-covered ground in the winter Let's look at two examples of how organisms are adapted to such changes. If you have ever been to the seaside and looked for creatures in rock pools, you are likely to have seen lots of limpets on the rocks. When the tide is in, limpets move over sea-covered rocks, scraping off tiny bits of seaweed. When the tide goes out, limpets clamp themselves very tightly against the newly exposed rock. This makes it difficult for predators to pull them off the rock to eat them. It also stops the limpets losing water, or being washed away by waves. The snowshoe hare lives in Canada and other parts of North America. The snowshoe hare has brown fur during the summer, to help camouflage it amongst the earth and plants. Its fur is white during the winter, to help camouflage it in the snow. This adaptation makes it more difficult for predators to see the snowshoe hare, whatever the season.	5
A species becomes extinct when there are no more individuals of that species left. An extinct species has gone forever. Here are some of the things that can cause a species to become extinct: a change in the physical environment, such as a change in the long-term temperature or rainfall patterns competition from another species that is better adapted, including competition from humans For example, dinosaurs became extinct millions of years ago. This was probably due to changes in the environment. But many species have become extinct more recently because of competition from humans. The dodo was a flightless bird found on the island of Mauritius. It became extinct in the seventeenth century because of human activities. Humans disturbed the dodo's habitat and also brought new predators to the island, like pigs and dogs.	5
Humans are very successful living things. We compete with other organisms for many natural resources. These include: land (for farms, buildings and roads) water (for drinking, watering fields, and industry) The worldâ€™s population of humans is increasing all the time. In the year 1800 it was about 1 billion, and now it is more than 6 billion (that's 6,000,000,000). More people mean more use of natural resources, and bigger changes to the environment. The graph shows population growth over the last 200 years. Humans use machines to move large amounts of earth to make new roads and buildings. We straighten rivers and build walls to stop them flooding. In some countries, such as the Netherlands, land is reclaimed from the sea. Barriers are built and water is pumped out. New dry land forms for people to use. We also large areas of land for quarries. These are large holes in the ground where rocks containing useful metals are taken out. The environment is also changed when land is flooded to make reservoirs for drinking water or hydroelectric power schemes. The animals and plants that live in the forest or on the land lose their habitat. They may die out in that region as a result. Humans have been cutting down trees for thousands of years. We do this to clear land for farming and building, and for wood to use as a fuel or building material. Forestry is sustainable as long as forests are allowed to replace themselves, or are replanted after felling, but often this is not done. The result is that the worldâ€™s forests are steadily shrinking. The maps below show the loss of forest across the world over the last 10 thousand years. The world's forests 8000 BC	5
Living things produce waste materials, such as urine and faeces. Humans produce these, too, but they also produce other waste materials. These materials can pollute the environment. They include: Rubbish does not vanish when it is thrown away. A lot of it is buried in landfill sites. These may be disused quarries or rough ground that cannot be used for farming or housing. When landfill sites are full of rubbish, they are covered in soil and planted with trees and bushes. Recycling rubbish is important because fewer landfill sites are needed, and the materials in the rubbish are re-used. Fertilisers are chemicals used by farmers to help their crops grow well. Rain can wash fertilizers off the fields and into rivers. This causes water plants to overgrow and block out the light. Other plants die as a result. They use up oxygen as they rot away, and fish and other animals suffocate. This process is called eutrophication. Smoke from burning fuels makes buildings turn black. With other waste chemicals in the air, it can form smog. This makes the air hazy, especially over large towns and cities. The polluted air can make it difficult to breathe. Acidic gases such as sulfur dioxide are produced when fossil fuels like coal, oil and gas burn. Sulfur dioxide dissolves in the clouds and causes acid rain. This damages buildings, trees and harms life in rivers and lakes. It also causes chemical weathering of rocks to happen much faster than normal.	5
Some heat energy from the Earthâ€™s surface escapes into space. If too much heat energy escaped, the planet would be very cold. However some gases in the atmosphere can trap escaping heat energy, causing some of it to pass back to the surface. These are called greenhouse gases, and they keep our planet warm, which is a good thing. Carbon dioxide is an important greenhouse gas. Humans burn fossil fuels such as oil, coal and natural gas. The energy released is used to power cars and other machines, to generate electricity, and to keep buildings warm. The burning fuel releases waste gases, including carbon dioxide. As the human population increases, more fuel is used, and more carbon dioxide is released. The extra carbon dioxide increases the greenhouse effect. More heat is trapped by the atmosphere, causing the planet to become warmer than it would be naturally. The increase in global temperature this causes is called global warming. Global warming is beginning to cause big changes in the environment. These include: The extra heat energy is also beginning to cause large-scale changes in the weather. These changes in weather patterns around the world are called climate change.	5
Did you know rocks are all very different? Here, you can see how they are formed.	5
This Revision Bite looks at the three types of rock: sedimentary, igneous and metamorphic. It looks at how they are formed, the weathering of rocks and the way one form of rock turns into another, in the rock cycle. This Revision Bite covers: What are rocks?	5
Remember that there are three main types of rock: Sedimentary, for example chalk, limestone, sandstone and shale; Igneous, for example basalt and granite; Metamorphic, for example slate and marble The Earth's rocks do not stay the same forever. They are continually changing because of processes such as weathering and large earth movements. The rocks are gradually recycled over millions of years. This is called the rock cycle. For example sedimentary rocks can be changed into metamorphic rocks, and these can be weathered and the pieces transported away. These pieces could be deposited in lakes or seas and eventually form new sedimentary rock. Many routes through the rock cycle are possible. The processes in the rock cycle are shown in this diagram. Make sure that you understand how each type of rock forms, and be ready to give an example of each type of rock. Compaction and cementation presses the layers and sticks the particles together. This creates sedimentary rock. Rocks underground that get heated and put under pressure are changed into metamorphic rock. Rocks underground that get heated so much they melt turn into magma. Magma is liquid rock. Magma also comes from deeper inside the Earth, from an region called the mantle. Pressure can forces magma out of the ground. This creates a volcano. When the magma cools it turns into solid rock, called extrusive igneous rock. Magma that cools underground forms solid rock called intrusive igneous rock. Areas of rock can move slowly upwards, pushed up by pressure of the rocks forming underneath. This is called uplift. Weathering breaks down rocks on the surface of the Earth. There are three types of weathering - physical, chemical and biological. Wind and water move the broken rock particles away. This is called erosion. Rivers and streams transport rock particles to other places. Rock particles are deposited in lakes and seas, where they build up to form layers. This starts the process of sedimentation which will create sedimentary rock.	5
Rocks are made of grains that fit together. Each grain in the rock is made from a mineral, which is a chemical compound. The grains in a rock can be different colours, shapes and sizes. Some types of rock have interlocking grains that fit tightly together. Granite is a rock with interlocking grains. Other types of rock have rounded grains. Sandstone is a rock with rounded grains. Rocks with rounded grains are more likely to absorb water than rocks with interlocking grains. This is because the water can get into the gaps between the grains. Rocks that absorb water are called porous. Rocks with rounded grains are usually softer and more crumbly than rocks with interlocking grains. So porous rocks tend to be softer than non-porous rocks. Rocks with interlocking grains are more likely to be hard and non-porous	5
There are three main types of rock: sedimentary, igneous and metamorphic. A river carries, or transports, pieces of broken rock as it flows along. When the river reaches a lake or the sea, its load of transported rocks settles to the bottom. We say that the rocks are deposited. The deposited rocks build up in layers, called sediments. This process is called sedimentation. The weight of the sediments on top squashes the sediments at the bottom. This is called compaction. The water is squeezed out from between the pieces of rock and crystals of different salts form. The crystals form a sort of glue that sticks or cements the pieces of rock together. This process is called cementation. These processes eventually make a type of rock called sedimentary rock. It may take millions of years for sedimentary rocks to form. These are the different processes in order: The river transports bits of rock, and deposits them on the bottom of the river bed. Sedimentary rocks contain rounded grains in layers. Examples of sedimentary rock are: The oldest layers are at the bottom and the youngest layers are at the top. Sedimentary rocks may contain fossils of animals and plants trapped in the sediments as the rock was formed.	5
The second type of rock we'll look at is igneous rock. The inside of the Earth is very hot - hot enough to melt rocks. Molten (liquid) rock forms when rocks melt. The molten rock is called magma. When the magma cools and solidifies, a type of rock called igneous rock forms. Igneous rocks contain randomly arranged interlocking crystals. The size of the crystals depends on how quickly the molten magma solidified. The more slowly the magma cools, the bigger the crystals. You may have done an experiment at school with a substance called salol. If molten salol cools slowly, you get big crystals. If it cools quickly, you get small crystals. If the magma cools quickly, small crystals form in the rock. This can happen if the magma erupts from a volcano. Obsidian and basalt are examples of this type of rock. They are called extrusive igneous rocks because they form from eruptions of magma. If the magma cools slowly, large crystals form in the rock. This can happen if the magma cools deep underground. Granite and gabbro are examples of this type of rock. They are intrusive igneous rocks because they form from magma underground. Unlike sedimentary rocks, igneous rocks do not contain any fossils. This is because any fossils in the original rock will have melted when the magma formed.	5
Metamorphic rocks are the third type we'll look at. They formed from other rocks that are changed because of heat or pressure. Earth movements can cause rocks to be deeply buried or squeezed. As a result, the rocks are heated and put under great pressure. They do not melt, but the minerals they contain are changed chemically, forming metamorphic rocks. Sometimes, metamorphic rocks are formed when rocks are close to some molten magma, and so get heated up. Remember that metamorphic rocks are not made from melting rock. (Rocks that do melt form igneous rocks instead.) When a metamorphic rock is formed under pressure, its crystals become arranged in layers. Slate, which is formed from shale, is like this. Slate is useful for making roof tiles because its layers can be split into separate flat sheets. Marble is another example of a metamorphic rock. It is formed from limestone. Metamorphic rocks sometimes contain fossils if they were formed from a sedimentary rock, but the fossils are usually squashed out of shape. Metamorphic rocks can be formed from any other type of rock - sedimentary or igneous. Remember these two examples of common metamorhpic rocks and where they come from:	5
Rocks gradually wear away. This is called weathering. There are three types of weathering: Remember, when you answer questions about weathering, mention what is causing the weathering and what it does to the rock. Physical weathering is caused by physical changes such as changes in temperature, freezing and thawing, and the effects of wind, rain and waves. When a rock gets hot it expands a little, and when a rock gets cold it contracts a little. If a rock is heated and cooled many times, cracks form and pieces of rock fall away. This type of physical weathering happens a lot in deserts, because it is very hot during the day but very cold at night. Wind, rain and waves can all cause weathering. The wind can blow tiny grains of sand against a rock. These wear the rock away and weather it. Rain and waves can also wear away rock over long periods of time. Water expands slightly when it freezes into ice. This is why water pipes sometimes burst in the winter. You might have seen a demonstration of this sort of thing at school - a jar filled to the brim with water eventually shatters after it is put into a freezer. The formation of ice can also break rocks. If water gets into a crack in a rock and then freezes, it expands and pushes the crack further apart. When the ice melts later, water can get further into the crack. When the rock freezes again, it expands and makes the crack even bigger. This process of freezing and thawing can continue until the crack becomes so big that a piece of rock falls off.	5
Animals and plants can wear away rocks. This is called biological weathering. For example, burrowing animals such as rabbits can burrow into a crack in a rock, making it bigger and splitting the rock. You may have seen weeds growing through cracks in the pavement. If you have gone for a walk in the countryside, you may even have seen bushes or trees growing from cracks in rocks or disused buildings. This is because plant roots can grow in cracks. As they grow bigger, the roots push open the cracks and make them wider and deeper. Eventually pieces of rock may fall away. People can even cause biological weathering just by walking. Over time, paths in the countryside become damaged because of all the boots and shoes wearing them away.	5
The weathering of rocks by chemicals is called chemical weathering. Rainwater is naturally slightly acidic because carbon dioxide from the air dissolves in it. Minerals in rocks may react with the rainwater, causing the rock to be weathered. Some types of rock are easily weathered by chemicals. For example, limestone and chalk are made of a mineral called calcium carbonate. When acidic rainwater falls on limestone or chalk, a chemical reaction happens. New soluble substances are formed in the reaction. These are washed away and the rock is weathered. Chemical weathering can hollow out caves form and make cliffs fall away. Some types of rock are not easily weathered by chemicals. For example, granite and gabbro are hard rocks that are weathered only slowly. Still some of their minerals do react with the acids in rainwater to form new, weaker substances that crumble and fall away. When fossil fuels such as coal, oil and natural gas are burned, carbon dioxide and sulfur dioxide escape into the air. These dissolve in the water in the clouds and make the rainwater more acidic than normal. When this happens, we call the rain 'acid rain'. Acid rain makes chemical weathering happen more quickly. Buildings and statues made from rock are damaged as a result. This is worse when the rock is limestone rather than granite. Acid rain also kills trees and fish.	5
Weathering and erosion are often confused, so be careful when answering questions about them. Weathering is the wearing away of rocks. Erosion is the movement of the broken pieces away from the site of weathering. For example, a basalt cliff may be weathered by freeze-thaw, a type of physical weathering. This means that pieces of the cliff may break away. Erosion happens when these pieces of rock fall away down the cliff. In the photograph you can see a basalt cliff. At the bottom there are heaps of rocks, caused by weathering then erosion. Rivers and streams can move pieces of rock. This is called transport. Fast flowing rivers can transport large rocks, but slow moving rivers can only transport tiny pieces of rock. As the pieces of rock are carried along by the water, they bash against each other and the river bed. They gradually wear away because of this. They become smaller and more rounded.	5
Humans, animals and plants have similar life processes. But, the cell functions, reproductive patterns, food chains and behaviour are very different for each species.	5
What do you learn about when you observe the actions and reactions of animals? Behaviour.	5
There are several types of behaviour in humans and other animals that can be described and investigated by scientific research. This Revision Bite covers:	5
Here are two examples of instinctive behaviour in animals: Instincts are useful because they do not have to be learned and they can be complex, like the examples above. Instincts let animals form groups for protection, choose mates, fight to be in charge, and show many other behaviours. Reflexes are a type of instinct. They happen automatically because of a particular stimulus. For example, if your hand touches something hot by accident, it automatically and quickly moves away. You do not have to learn to do this. When the school bell rings at the end of break time, the students leave the playground and go to their lessons. People may say that the students are acting on instinct. But they would be wrong. An instinct is a behaviour that happens automatically without any learning needed. The students have learned that the bell is a signal to do something, so leaving the playground when the bell rings is not an instinct. It is learned behaviour.	5
Ducklings are able to walk almost immediately after hatching from the egg, and can even swim after a few days. They recognise their mother because of a behaviour type called imprinting. Ducklings will follow the first moving object they meet after hatching. They become socially attached to this object and treat it as their mother. Imprinting lets young animals recognise their mother from a young age. They can follow her for food and protection. Imprinting is useful if the first moving object they see really is their mother. But ducklings will imprint on people, balls and even cardboard boxes if these happen to be the first things they see. Geese, chicks, and other baby birds that can walk around shortly after hatching, also show imprinting behaviour. Konrad Lorenz (1903 to 1989) was an Austrian scientist who studied animal behaviour. He discovered that if he reared geese from when they hatched, they became imprinted on him. They followed him around and preferred to be near him even when they had grown into adult geese. Lorenz won the 1973 Nobel Prize for Physiology and Medicine because of his experiments on animal behaviour.	5
Conditioning is a type of behaviour involving a response to a stimulus that is different from the natural one. It's a type of learned behaviour. Ivan Pavlov (1849 to 1936) was a Russian scientist who investigated conditioning. He discovered that dogs produced extra saliva when they were offered food. This is a natural response to a stimulus - food makes a dog's mouth water. The saliva produced is needed to start digesting food and to make swallowing food easier. Pavlov noticed that they also did this when the person who fed them came into the room, even if the person had not brought any food. Pavlov went on to ring a bell at the start of feeding time, and eventually the dogs produced extra saliva when they heard the bell, before any food was brought in. A dog salivating when it hears a bell is not a natural response. They would not do this without being conditioned to do so. The behaviour has been learned. It's called a conditioned response. People and animals can be conditioned to avoid certain things. For example, grazing animals get an unpleasant electric shock when they touch an electric fence. They eventually avoid the fence, even when it is turned off.	5
Imitation is a type of behaviour where one animal copies another animal. Humans often imitate each other, often without realising it. When people talk to each other, they may stand or sit in a similar way, and copy each otherâ€™s movements. Scientists think that this happens so that the speakers feel more at ease with other. Imitation helps us to learn how to do new things. Your teachers often show you how to do something new, and then guide you as you try to repeat what they did. Some scientists think that humans are the only animals that copy each other. Other scientists have observed chimpanzees and other primates imitating each other. For example, chimpanzees can use sticks to spear juicy grubs to eat. Other chimpanzees copy this behaviour. In this way they learn new skills.	5
Humans show many of the same types of behaviour as other animals. But human behaviour is often more complex because we are more intelligent and aware of ourselves. Humans have instincts, but it is possible for us to overcome natural urges to follow a certain behaviour. For example, a hungry person might want to start eating immediately when they sit down at the dinner table, but they have learned that good manners mean they should wait until everyone is seated and ready to eat. People often imitate each other. This can help them learn something new and useful, such as new skill in lessons, sport or at work. It can also lead them to show less useful behaviour. For example, young people may start smoking, drinking alcohol or taking drugs as a result of copying each other to â€˜fit inâ€™. Conditioning can be used to change the behaviour of people. Advertisers are very skilled at this. They use pictures of their products which make the them look glamorous or exciting, often by using famous actors or sports people. By associating the product with attractive images the advertisers are trying to set up a conditioned response to their product. People will respond positively and buy the product.	5
Behaviour can be investigated in the â€˜fieldâ€™ or in the laboratory. It can be observed and measured, and experiments can be designed to test how it works. Human behaviour is affected by many variables. It can be more difficult to study than the behaviour of other animals. â€˜Fieldworkâ€™ does not always mean you have to work in a field. It means investigations that take place outside the laboratory. Some scientists spend many hours watching and studying the behaviour of animals. They may be interested in how the animals live alone, group into families or form large groups such as herds. Animals can signal to each other. For example, they may call to each other to warn of danger. Some scientists are interested in such signals. They record and study them to try to work out what the signals mean. Some animals migrate over large distances to find food or nesting sites. Animals can be â€˜taggedâ€™ by attaching tracking devices to them. Tagging lets scientists follow the journeys the animals make. The work of Lorentz and Pavlov has been mentioned in this Revision Bite. These scientists studied animal behaviour under controlled conditions. The behaviour of woodlice is often studied in schools. Several woodlice are put into a choice chamber with four different conditions: The woodlice are left on their own for a while, and then the number of animals in each quarter is counted. Woodlice prefer dark and damp conditions. The quarter of the choice chamber with these conditions contains most or all of the woodlice.	5
What do we all have in common? Cells. See how they are similar and how they differ between organisms.	5
"Animals and plants are made of cells. Cells form the basic ""building blocks"" for living things. Some cells have specialised functions. Tissues are made from cells of a similar type. Organs are made from tissues, and systems are made from several organs working together. This Revision Bite covers: Cells, tissues and organ systems"	5
Cells are very small. They are the basic building blocks of all animals and plants. These photographs show cells seen through a microscope. These are cheek cells, seen through a microscope: These are onion cells, seen through a microscope:	5
Animal cells usually have an irregular shape, and plant cells usually have a regular shape Cells are made up of different parts. It is easier to explain what these parts are by using diagrams like the ones below. Animal cells and plant cells both contain: cell membrane, cytoplasm, nucleus Plant cells also contain these parts, not found in animal cells: chloroplasts, vacuole, cell wall The table summarises the functions of these parts. Controls what happens inside the cell. Carries genetic information. In exams don't call the nucleus the 'brain' of the cell. That is not a good description and will not get you marks.	5
Humans are multi-cellular animals. That means we are made of lots of cells, not just one cell. The cells in many multi-cellular animals and plants are specialised, so that they can share out the processes of life. They work together like a team to support the different processes in an organism. You should be able to work out special features of a cell from a drawing, if you are told what the cell can do. The tables below show examples of some specialised animal and plant cells, with their functions and special features. Female reproductive cell (egg cell) To join with male cell, and then to provide food for the new cell that's been formed Male reproductive cell (sperm cell) To reach female cell, and join with it	5
Animal cells and plant cells can form tissues, like muscle tissue. A living tissue is made from a group of cells with a similar structure and function, which all work together to do a particular job. Here are some examples of tissues: phloem (tubes that carry dissolved sugar around a plant) root hair tissue (for plants to take up water and minerals from the soil) An organ is made from a group of different tissues, which all work together to do a particular job. Here are some examples of organs: An organ system is made from a group of different organs, which all work together to do a particular job. Here are some examples of organ systems:	5
Why is a balanced diet important? See how you can take care of your health.	5
A balanced diet contains the different nutrients in the correct amounts to keep us healthy. Certain foods are not necessarily 'bad' for us, but eating too much of them could be. We will look at what food types are needed, how they are digested. Drugs are substances that affect our bodies. They can be medicines or recreational drugs, legal or illegal. We will look at these in detail. This Revision Bite covers:	5
There are seven different nutrients: Some foods are particularly rich in certain nutrients. The table shows why we need each nutrient, and some good sources of each.	5
"If you have too little of a particular nutrient, we say that you have a deficiency in that nutrient. For example, fibre is needed to keep food moving through the intestines easily, and people who have a fibre deficiency in their diet may get constipation. People with iron deficiency may get anaemia and have too few red blood cells. People with iodine deficiency may get a swelling in the neck called a goitre (pronounced ""goy-ter""). Although we only need small amounts of the different vitamins in our diet, we become ill if we don't get enough. For example, vitamin A deficiency can cause blindness. Vitamin C deficiency causes scurvy, which makes the gums bleed, and vitamin D deficiency causes rickets, which makes the legs bow outwards in growing children. Food is a store of chemical energy. If you look on the side of food packets you will see the food's energy content. This is usually measured in kilojoules, kJ. If we eat too little food, we will use up our store of fat and become too thin. If we eat too much food, especially foods rich in sugar and fat, we will increase our store of fat and become too fat. It is important to balance the amount of food we eat with who we are and what we do. The amount of energy we need from our food depends on our age, our height and how much exercise we get. For example, a one-year old baby needs 3850 kJ each day to continue to grow, whereas an adult Olympic swimmer in training needs 15,600 kJ each day. Someone who sits at a desk all day will need less food than their twin who climbs ladders all day to wash windows."	5
"When you eat a piece of bread, you don't wake up next day to discover it growing out of your arm! The food we eat has to be broken down into other substances that our bodies can use. This is called digestion. Without digestion, we could not absorb food into our bodies and use it. Digestion happens in the digestive system, which begins at the mouth and ends at the anus. After we swallow, our food passes through these organs in turn: Food is digested in the mouth, stomach and small intestine. Digested food is absorbed into the bloodstream in the small intestine. Excess water is absorbed back into the body in the large intestine. Any undigested food passes out of the anus as faeces (pronounced ""fee-seez"") when we go to the toilet. The liver and the pancreas play important part in digestion. The liver produces bile, which helps the digestion of fat. The pancreas produces chemicals called digestive enzymes."	5
Our teeth break food down into small pieces when we chew. This is only a start to the process of digestion, as chewed pieces of food are still too large to be absorbed by the body. Food has to be broken down chemically into really small particles before it can be absorbed. Enzymes are needed so that this break-down happens quickly enough to be useful. Take care - enzymes are not living things. They are just special proteins that can break large molecules into small molecules. Different types of enzymes can break down different nutrients: lipase enzymes break down fats into fatty acids and glycerol. Carbohydrates are digested in the mouth, stomach and small intestine. Carbohydrase enzymes break down starch into sugars. The saliva in your mouth contains amylase, which is another starch digesting enzyme. If you chew a piece of bread for long enough, the starch it contains is digested to sugar, and it begins to taste sweet. Proteins are digested in the stomach and small intestine. Protease enzymes break down proteins into amino acids. Digestion of proteins in the stomach is helped by stomach acid, which is strong hydrochloric acid. This also kills harmful micro-organisms that may be in the food. Lipase enzymes break down fat into fatty acids and glycerol. Digestion of fat in the small intestine is helped by bile, made in the liver. Bile breaks the fat into small droplets that are easier for the lipase enzymes to work on. Minerals, vitamins and water are already small enough to be absorbed by the body without being broken down, so they are not digested. Digestive enzymes cannot break down fibre, which is why it cannot be absorbed by the body.	5
These are the processes that happen in the digestive system: We've already looked at how foods are broken down by enzymes in digestion. Now we will look at how the products of digestion are absorbed into the body. Digested food molecules are absorbed in the small intestine. This means that they pass through the wall of the small intestine and into our bloodstream. Once in the bloodstream, the digested food molecules are carried around the body to where they are needed. Only small, soluble substances can pass across the wall of the small intestine. Large insoluble substances cannot pass through. Study the slideshow to check your understanding of this. The inside wall of the small intestine needs to be thin, with a really big surface area. This allows absorption to happen quickly and efficiently. If the small intestine had a thick wall and a small surface area, a lot of digested food might pass out of the body before it had a chance to be absorbed. To get a big surface area, the inside wall of the small intestine is lined with tiny villi (one of them is called a villus). These stick out and give a big surface area. They also contain blood capillaries to carry away the absorbed food molecules. Excess water is absorbed back into the body in the large intestine. What is left then is undigested food. This is stored in the rectum, the lower part of the large intestine, until we are ready to go to the toilet. It then comes out of the rectum through the anus as faeces. This process is called egestion.	5
Smoking is very harmful to health. It causes around 80 per cent of deaths from lung cancer, bronchitis and emphysema in the UK, and almost a fifth of UK deaths from heart disease. Tobacco smoke contains many harmful substances. These include: A normal lung and a lung from a smoker: Tar causes cancer of the lungs, mouth and throat. It coats the surface of the breathing tubes and the alveoli. This causes coughing and damages the alveoli, making it more difficult for gas exchange to happen. Cells in the lining of the breathing tubes produce sticky mucus to trap dirt and microbes. Cells with tiny hair-like parts, called cilia, normally move the mucus out of the lungs. Hot smoke and tar from smoking damages the cilia. So smokers cough to move the mucus and are more likely to get bronchitis. Nicotine is addictive - it causes a smoker to want more cigarettes. Nicotine also increases the heart rate and blood pressure, and makes blood vessels narrower than normal. This can lead to heart disease. Carbon monoxide is a gas that takes the place of oxygen in red blood cells. This reduces the amount of oxygen that the blood can carry. This means that the circulatory system has to work harder, causing heart disease.	5
Drugs are substances that have effects on the body. Medicines are drugs that help people suffering from pain or disease. Recreational drugs are taken for pleasure. Some recreational drugs are legal, such as tobacco, alcohol and caffeine. Most other recreational drugs are illegal, such as cannabis, ecstasy and heroin. Recreational drugs can be classified as depressants or stimulants. Most recreational drugs can be addictive. All drugs can damage the liver, because it is the liver that breaks drugs down in the body. Any drug that is misused can cause damage to the body, as well as personal and social problems. Injecting any drug with a needle and syringe that someone else has used may lead to a number of diseases from infected blood, including HIV and hepatitis. Other depressants include cannabis, heroin and solvents (eg glue and aerosols). Here are some of the typical effects depressants have on the body: feelings of well-being a distorted view of the world, or hallucinations Some of the long-term effects of depressants on the body include damage to the liver, brain and heart. They can also have the following effects: cannabis causes loss of memory and concentration, as well as an increased risk of mental illness. Stimulants speed up messages in the brain and along the nerves. This makes you feel more alert. Caffeine is a stimulant and is found in cola drinks, coffee and tea. It makes you feel more energetic and alert, but it can also cause insomnia (difficulty in sleeping), headaches and nervousness. Cocaine, ecstasy and amphetamines are all illegal stimulants. They make you feel more energetic and confident, but they can damage the liver and heart. They can also cause loss of memory and concentration, and bring an increased risk of mental illness.	5
Want to know how diseases are caused? Or, maybe you want to know how to avoid them?	5
This Revision Bite is about disease - the microbes that cause it and what our bodies do to fight and prevent it. This Revision Bite covers: Microbes - useful or not?	5
Many living things are so small that they can only be seen through a microscope. These living things are called microorganisms or microbes. There are three main types of microbe: Mushrooms and toadstools are fungi, but these are made of lots of cells, so they are not microbes. Yeasts are single-celled fungi, so they are microbes. Fungi are usually the biggest type of microbe. If there is just one of them, we call it a fungus. Bacteria are usually smaller than fungi. If there is just one of them, we call it a bacterium. Bacteria have many different shapes. Some have 'tails' (called flagella) that let them swim. Viruses are the smallest type of microbe. As a virus can only reproduce inside a cell, some people are not convinced that viruses are really living things. The table shows some of the similarities and differences between the three types of microbe.	5
People often use the word germ instead of microbe, so you might think that microbes are all harmful. But some are useful to us. Yeast cells are useful to bakers and brewers. Yeast cells can change sugar into carbon dioxide gas and alcohol. This is useful to bakers because the gas helps the bread rise, and it is useful to brewers because it adds the alcohol needed for their drinks. Bacteria are also useful to us. For example, certain bacteria cause the changes needed in milk to make yogurt and cheese out of it. Many microbes can cause diseases. For example here are some diseases caused by fungi: athlete's foot tuberculosis, TB (affects the lungs) whooping cough (affects the lungs) chicken pox (affects skin and nerves) measles (affects skin and lungs) mumps (affects salivary glands) Microbes cause disease when they are able to reproduce in the body. They produce harmful substances called toxins, and damage tissues and organs. We say that someone who has harmful disease-causing microbes in them is infected.	5
Many harmful microbes can pass from one person to another. Diseases caused by such microbes are said to be infectious diseases. Here are some ways that harmful microbes can be spread: Droplets containing microbes fly into the air when people sneeze or cough. The microbes they contain get into other people if breathed in. Chicken pox, colds, flu, measles and tuberculosis are spread like this. Animals may carry harmful microbes. The microbes can get into a person who is scratched or bitten by such an animal. Malaria is a tropical disease spread by a tiny fly called a mosquito. Food can have harmful microbes in and on it. The microbes get into the body when the food is eaten, causing food poisoning. Thorough cooking kills most microbes, but they can survive under-cooking. Careless handling of food increases the risk from harmful microbes. Microbes can be passed from one person to another when people touch each other, or when they touch something an infected person has handled. Athlete's food is spread like this. Bacteria on the skin can be killed by antiseptics, and bacteria on surfaces can be killed by disinfectants. Washing your hands reduces the chance of spreading microbes. Water can have harmful microbes in it. The microbes get into the body when the water is swallowed. Cholera is a disease caused by a bacterium that spreads like this. Thorough boiling or adding chlorine to the water can reduce the chance of spreading microbes in this way.	5
The body has natural barriers to stop harmful microbes getting inside the body. Here are some of them: sticky mucus in the lungs traps microbes, and then cilia sweep it out of the lungs scabs form on the skin if you get a cut, stopping microbes from getting into your body The body has an immune system that kills microbes if they get past the natural barriers. White blood cells are very important in the immune system. There are different sorts of these cells, but they can do two main jobs. Some white blood cells can engulf microbes and kill them. Some white blood cells can make substances called antibodies that stick to microbes. Microbes have chemicals called antigens. Different microbes have different antigens. White blood cells have chemicals called antibodies. White blood cells can stick to microbes if they have the right antibody to match the antigen on the microbe. When this happens the microbes can be killed, or clumped together to make it easier for other white blood cells to kill them.	5
Antibiotics are medicines used by doctors when harmful microbes have made you ill. They are substances that harm bacteria. Some antibiotics stop the bacteria reproducing and others kill the bacteria directly. Antibiotics are helpful to treat diseases caused by bacteria, such as tuberculosis and food poisoning. They do not harm viruses, so antibiotics cannot treat diseases such as colds and flu, which are caused by viruses. Antibiotics only work against bacteria, not viruses When you are infected by a microbe, it takes time for your body to start fighting the infection. It does this by making enough white blood cells with the correct antibody. During this time, you continue to feel unwell. You begin to recover when enough antibodies have been produced. After the microbes have been killed, the amount of antibodies goes down again. But some of the white blood cells that produce the correct antibody remain in your blood. After a second infection by the same microbe, your body makes the correct antibodies much faster, because of the white blood cells that remain from when you had the first infection. The microbe doesn't get a chance to make you ill this time, and we say that you are immune to the microbe and the disease it causes. Check your understanding of this by studying the animation. Immunisation is a process that doctors use to make people immune from certain illnesses, even before they have been infected. It involves you receiving an injection containing a vaccine. Vaccines contain a dead or weak form of the disease-causing microbe, or some of its antigens. In response to the vaccine your immune system produces white blood cells with the correct antibody to kill the microbe, so you become immune without falling ill. You are likely to have been immunised against several microbes, viruses and bacteria, including the ones that cause diphtheria, whooping cough, polio, tetanus, meningitis, measles, mumps and tuberculosis. Girls are also immunised against rubella. Vaccination works against diseases caused by both bacteria and viruses.	5

In this Revision Bite we'll look at the feeding relationships between living things. These can be shown in food chains and food webs. All food chains start with green plants. Green plants use sunlight to produce the source of their energy. This energy is then passed along the food chain as one organism eats another. This Revision Bite covers: Getting carbon dioxide, light and water	5
Before we look at food chains we will go over the way green plants capture energy from the Sun to make food. This is the start of all the food chains we will look at. Animals eat food to get their energy. But green plants don't. Instead they make their own food, glucose, in a process called photosynthesis. We say that plants can photosynthesise. These are the things that plants need for photosynthesis: These are the things that plants make by photosynthesis: We can show photosynthesis in a word equation, where light energy is shown in brackets because it is not a substance: Plants get carbon dioxide from the air through their leaves, and water from the ground through their roots. Light energy comes from the sun. The oxygen produced is released into the air from the leaves. The glucose produced can be turned into other substances, such as starch, which is used as a store of energy. This energy can be released by respiration. Photosynthesis takes place inside plant cells in small things called chloroplasts. Chloroplasts contain a green substance called chlorophyll. This absorbs the light energy needed to make photosynthesis happen. Plants can only photosynthesise in the light.	5
Assessment objective 1 (AO1) is about recording your observations, experiences and ideas. Keep it in mind all through your course! If you're not sure what it means, this Revision Bite will help you. Assessment objective 1 (AO1) is about getting your ideas down in a work journal. Doing it well will give you a lot of help when covering the other three objectives. Remember - the more you record your work, the better you can choose what to put in your work journal [work journal: A book in which a daily record of things that have happened is kept. An alternative name for a sketchbook or log book. ].	6
You'll need to store the information you collect during your course. A work journal is a popular choice. You can put something in every few days to show the ideas you've had as you've thought about your topic. But you can store your work some other way if you like. A work journal shows what you've done through your course, shows your ideas, and shows you've covered the assessment objectives. Work journals should be easy to carry around - so not too big. But not too small either - or you'll get nothing in. An A3 size is about right. Work journals should also be strong enough to allow for a lot of drawing, painting and pasting, and to stay looking good. It should probably have a hard cover, and thick paper inside. You could have one work journal for each unit of coursework, and one for the exam.	6
A student's work journal with images and explanations Everything in your work journal should be there for a reason - not just to look pretty. Think about where to put pictures, sketches and annotations before you start. Aim for a logical layout, so people can see the links between things on a page. When sticking pictures into your work journal, use a small amount of glue - it'll stop things getting messy. Your work journal is a kind of visual journey, so do make it exciting. Try writing in different colours, or using different kinds of paper. For a good impact, use a wide variety of mediamedia: a collective name for images, video and audio - perhaps including annotations, sketches and photographs, as shown here. A student's work journal with a variety of media including painted images and written notes Use more than just a pencil when you're sketching.

Assessment objective 1 (AO1) is about recording your observations, experiences and ideas. Keep it in mind all through your course! If you're not sure what it means, this Revision Bite will help you. Assessment objective 1 (AO1) is about getting your ideas down in a work journal. Doing it well will give you a lot of help when covering the other three objectives. Remember - the more you record your work, the better you can choose what to put in your work journal [work journal: A book in which a daily record of things that have happened is kept. An alternative name for a sketchbook or log book. ]. You'll need to store the information you collect during your course. A work journal is a popular choice. You can put something in every few days to show the ideas you've had as you've thought about your topic. But you can store your work some other way if you like. A work journal shows what you've done through your course, shows your ideas, and shows you've covered the assessment objectives. Work journals should be easy to carry around - so not too big. But not too small either - or you'll get nothing in. An A3 size is about right. Work journals should also be strong enough to allow for a lot of drawing, painting and pasting, and to stay looking good. It should probably have a hard cover, and thick paper inside. You could have one work journal for each unit of coursework, and one for the exam. A student's work journal with images and explanations Everything in your work journal should be there for a reason - not just to look pretty. Think about where to put pictures, sketches and annotations before you start. Aim for a logical layout, so people can see the links between things on a page. When sticking pictures into your work journal, use a small amount of glue - it'll stop things getting messy. Your work journal is a kind of visual journey, so do make it exciting. Try writing in different colours, or using different kinds of paper. For a good impact, use a wide variety of mediamedia: a collective name for images, video and audio - perhaps including annotations, sketches and photographs, as shown here. A student's work journal with a variety of media including painted images and written notes Use more than just a pencil when you're sketching. Also experiment with chalks and charcoal (remember to use a fixative), or paints. This animation showing a mangosteen (it's a fruit) shows how different art materials create interesting effects. Pieces of fabrics in your work journal could be interesting - as in the example below. A student's work journal with swatches of fabric and images Do show your work journals to other students. See if they can follow the visual journey you are making. Sharing ideas helps everyone improve their work. Helen talks about her work journal, how she goes back to see what she's written in it, and how it helps her develop her ideas.

Artists and designers spend a lot to time looking closely at the things all around them - then showing what they see, with a sketch or a photo. They always first look carefully at the object they want to draw or photograph - to pick up on interesting tiny details. This is called first-hand observation. Primary sources are the things you see yourself, and sketch or photograph yourself. Try sketching some of the things that you see everyday. This will help your powers of observation. Artists always examine what they are going to draw first, so they see those tiny details that might be missed at first glance. The more you look at something, the more detail you will see. Alternatively, you might wish to take inspiration from somewhere that's not home. Take a trip to a different town or city, or maybe visit the countryside. If you are arranging your own subject to draw such as a still-life, then try to make it as visually interesting as possible. For instance when drawing from primary sources you may want to consider creating interesting compositions, drawing to scale, making your own viewfinder or drawing sections and close-ups. (You can read more about viewfinders later in this revision bite.)	6
A student's preparation sketch work using a viewfinder. Viewfinders are like small windows that allow you to observe a section (small part) of a bigger picture. Viewfinders can be used with paintings, drawings or photographs. When you use a viewfinder, you are concentrating on just one part of a picture that you can then sketch straight into your work journal. It is useful for developing your observational skills, for finding out about scale and to notice those all-important details. You can make your own viewfinder out of a thick piece of card. All you need to do is to cut a large enough hole in the card. Itâ€™s a good idea to put this viewfinder into your work journal. You can attach it to your work journal either by making two holes with a hole-puncher and then threading it into the spirals of the work journal, or just attaching it with a strip of cloth. It will then always be nearby when you need it and also becomes part of your record of work at the end. If you want to see greater detail in your drawing, then you could use a magnifying glass. Always make sure that you are using a free-standing magnifying glass because it's very difficult to hold a magnifying glass and draw at the same time.	6
A visit to any museum or art gallery will provide you with lots of opportunities to develop ideas and your knowledge and understanding of a subject. If you see something of interest, make some sketches in your work journal, include postcards from the museum shop or images from the museum or gallery website. If you are concentrating on one work of art [art: The expression of creativity or imagination or both. ], then you should make a note of the name of the artist, the title of the piece and the date it was created. The labels next to the work of art may also contain a lot of useful information such as biographical details on the artist, the social context of the work of art and influences on the artist. A student's sketch of an Egyptian artefact While you are in a museum, do not just look at the works of art you came to see. Take some time to look at the other artefacts on display. Artefacts often have interesting design features that might fit in with your coursework. For instance, if you are looking at a certain aspect of African sculpture then there might be some sculpture in the museum display from other parts of the world, or objects from ancient Egypt, that might be inspiring. While you are visiting a museum or gallery take note of how the artworks are grouped together. Artworks are not always grouped in a chronological date order. In some cases, artworks may be grouped by subject or by key art movements. Seeing how artworks can be grouped together should help you to think creatively, and explore different avenues of thought that you might not have considered previously. Georgie visits the Tate Modern Gallery in London to get ideas for her theme.	6
Brainstorming is an excellent way of exploring your ideas in a visual way. It also shows how your ideas are linked to each other. The best way of doing a brainstorm in your work journal is using what is sometimes called a spidergram or mind map. Spider diagrams (or 'spidergrams') are usually used at the start of a unit of coursework or exam assignment. They allow you to collect together your first thoughts and ideas about a subject so that you can easily see what your intentions are going to be and how you might progress. A student's spidergram drawn during a brainstorming session However, you can use spidergrams at any point in your work journal. This is a good way of showing how your experiences and ideas have developed as you go through your coursework.	6
Your work journal should include primary sources (your own work) and secondary sources (other people's material from books, magazines, the internet, etc). This Revision Bite will explain more about secondary sources, and show how to use them to make your work journal look good. Secondary sources are images that have already been created by someone else. They will help your observational skills, and develop your understanding of a theme, subject or artist. Secondary sources can include photographs and other images. Just like drawing from primary sources, drawing from secondary sources will develop your observational skills. However, this time it is about examining sources created by another person. No matter what your coursework or examination assignment is, there is a very good chance that other artists have already explored the same themes. Use their works of art to develop your observational skills, to deepen your knowledge and understanding and to create your own ideas. Don't forget that different artists will interpret the same theme in different ways. If your theme is landscapes, then there is a huge difference between the photographs of Ansel Adams and the paintings of the Impressionists. Look at as many examples as you can and make a note of the differences between them. Click on the image to see a bigger version.

The web is a huge resource for research material to include in your work journal. However, there is so much material on the internet that you could waste a lot of time looking for something that you can use in your work journal. Reema talks about how she conducted her secondary research on textile artist Rachel Howard. Before you go onto the web always be clear about exactly what you are looking for. That way you will be able to find it much faster and you can then use the time you have saved to work on other things. If you are going to include text from a website, do not just copy and paste. You should be using your own words to express your ideas and experiences. Read through the text on the website that you are looking at and make some notes of the most important points. Then you can write these main points in your work journal, in any way you like. Don't forget that if you just copy and paste from a website, you are not selecting the information you really need. On top of that, the examiner who looks at your work journal will want to see your work and notes. Copied text from websites is very easy to spot. You can also find vast collections of images on the web that you can include in your work journal. You can save these images by moving the cursor over the image you are interested in, clicking on the right button of the mouse and then scrolling down the menu to 'Save image as'. If you are using a Mac, then just hold the mouse button down until the menu appears. The images of artworks that you research on the internet cannot be included in your final artworks unless you get permission. There's more about copyright later in this Revision Bite: Secondary Sources: Copyright To find out more about how to search for copyright free images, which you can use in your artwork, visit Bitesize DiDA's Revision Bite: Web Research.	6
If you are photocopying images from a book, cutting out images from a magazine or using an image you have found online, think about whether you need the whole image or just one or more of the details in it. If you only want a few details, then you should crop the picture by cutting out those sections you want to include in your work journal. You can photocopy or print the image out and then cut out the details you want. If it's an online image you could use the cropping tool on any image-editing software, or print it out and then cut it up. For instance, in the photograph above there's a llama on a mountain over-looking Machu Picchu in Peru. You could crop this image to cut out the backdrop so you have the llama only, as shown. Don't fall into the trap of just collecting lots of images to include in your work journal because you can. Before you use any images think about why you need that particular image. Only include an image if there is a good reason for having it.	6
You should also try to make your work journal visually appealing, so you could use scissors with different cutting edges to create a variety of effects, make use of different coloured pens and so on. In this student's work journal Sharmin has used secondary images of models to model the clothes and patterns she has designed. Remember that the images you create (primary) or use (secondary) can be manipulated, overlaid, annotated and built upon. Don't use secondary images too much - it might look as though you are just trying to fill space. There must always be a reason why you have included something in your work journal. When making use of a secondary image don't forget to read the text that goes with the picture because it will certainly contain information that you can include in your work journal. If you are taking images from a newspaper, then read the news item that goes with the picture and make a note of the important points.	6
Artists and writers own the copyright for anything they have created. They are protected by copyright law - this prevents other people from copying it without their permission. Copyright law protects anything you can copy - whether it is images or text from books, magazines or the internet. You are allowed to copy images and text for your own private use as long as you do not plan to use it in your own artwork or make any money from it. If you are including secondary sources in your work journal then that's fine - but do acknowledge where you got them from whereever possible. If you are planning to use somebody else's work in your artwork, then you must get permission from whoever owns the copyright. The copyright details are usually included in books and magazines on the front page. For TV programmes you may need to contact the production company. Websites usually have copyright information at the bottom of the webpage. For example if you look at the bottom of the BBC Schools website there is a link that says Schools Copyright (bbc.co.uk/schools/copyright/). Even if you do not need copyright permission, it is always good practice to acknowledge where your images or text come from. It shows the range of sources you have used.	6

Assessment objective 2 (AO2) is about analysing (looking carefully) and evaluating (having opinions about) all sorts of images and objects made by other artists and designers. You'll need to think about why designed objects or artworks are so important in our lives. Assessment objective 2 (AO2) follows on from your work on AO1 [AO1: Assessment objective 1 - the part of the GCSE Art and Design course that is about recording observations, experiences and ideas. ] - recording and observing. Remember AO2 should be followed throughout your coursework. The best way to approach AO2 is by using the SEMI approach. This is explained in the next Revision Bite.	6
"The visual and tactile elements are the individual parts that make up a piece of art, craft or design. In this Revision Bite, we will look at the elements of art, craft and design in more detail. By understanding and using the visual and tactile elements both within your visual work and writing, you will be covering assessment objective 2. The visual and tactile elements are line, tone, colour, pattern, texture, shape and form, and harmony and balance. ""The essence of drawing is the line exploring space."" A line is a point moving in space. A line can vary in width, length, curvature, colour or direction. Take a look at how artists John Piper and Pablo Picasso make use of line in their artwork. Easton, Portland, Dorset: St George Reform, 1964, John Piper John Piper uses simple white lines on a black background to portray a simple town scene. Look at the detailed use of pattern in the foreground to add a sense of depth to the overall image to the left. Click on the images above and below to see a bigger version. (If you have Flash, click Magnify to see the detail - to remove the viewfinder just click Magnify again.) This is a study by Pablo Picasso for his 'Weeping Woman'. He has used simple lines and blocks of primary colours. Note how the eyes have been emphasised with darker, thicker lines. Have a go at creating a continuous line drawing. Place an object in front of you - consider a stem with leaves, a plant or a flower. Next, do a continuous line drawing using a black biro or fine line pen and don't take your pen off the paper. Don't worry about a few extra lines. James's continuous line drawing If you want to add shadow, use heavier pressure and cross hatch. Again, don't take your pen off the paper. The more you look at the object, the better this drawing will turn out. You could try creating a continuous line drawing with your mouse by visiting www.imokta.co.uk/scribbler.asp. You can even send your continuous line drawing to a friend."	6
Tone is shading, from dark to light. In the drawing on the right, John Piper has used strong tonal shading. She really stands out from the darkness. This is acheived by the contrasts in tones. Note how the artist has made the right side of the head darker than its background, while the left side is lighter than the background. Figure Drawing, 1941, John Piper Note how the artist has used a combination of dark watercolour wash in the background, with heavy black and white marks in the foreground Click on the images to see a bigger version. (If you have Flash, click Magnify to see the detail - to remove the viewfinder just click Magnify again.) In the picture below the artist has painted a group of glaciated rocks. The darker background contrasts with the lighter tones of the rocks. He has added black lines to emphasise the structure and to create a sense of depth and mood.

Red, blue and yellow are known as primary colours. In theory, all other colours can be mixed from these three colours. The secondary colours are created by mixing two primary colours. THe secondary colours are green, purple and orange. On a colour wheel harmonious colours are side by side. Complementary colours are opposite each other. The complemantary of any primary colour is made by mixing the other two primaries. Warm colours are based on red and include red, yellow and orange. Cool colours are based on blue and include blue, green and indigo. See how the colours on the colour wheel are grouped together below.	6
Red is often described as a hot, fiery, passionate colour. Blue is often described as cool and cold and spatial. Yellow and blue are sometimes referred to as dynamic and exciting. Browns and greens can be called natural, calm colours. Artists often use certain colours to evoke particular emotions or create a certain type of atmosphere in an artwork. For example the colour red is often used to convey energy, war, danger, anger, passion, desire and love. Think about how colours can be used to help convey an emotion in your artwork. Remember that the use of colour can evoke different emotions to different people - this is often due to cultural differences or personal experiences. Look at the animation below as a starting point that you can build upon. This website from the Walker Center of Art tries to help students understand the nature of art. Take a look at key question 6: 'Does art express emotions?' and try out the activity: schools.walkerart.org/swita/ Now you have learnt about how artists make use of colour to convey emotions in their artwork have a go at the activity below.

Swing Low, 1964, David Annesley Try to look at each artwork carefully and break it down into parts or ideas.	6
Intent is how artists work their purpose, ideas and intentions. This information can sometimes be found in interviews or museum guides. Try and look into the historical, economical and/or social impacts that the artist may have experienced to see if you can find out more about their intentions. Remember not all artists have an intention when they create their artwork but art will usually have an affect on the people who view it. Below are lists of descriptive words that will help you think about why something was created and how it might affect a person when they see it or use it.

""I decided on a reclining figure that seeks to tell no story at all... people should have to ponder about what it means"". Henry Moore In order to completely cover AO2, analysing and evaluating, you should try to find out why an artist created their artwork. We have already looked at ""The Shelter Drawings"" of Henry Moore, now take a look at the activity below."	6
When you think about the media of an artwork it can often be described by the materials it is made from. Remember in AO2 you need to provide evidence that you have evaluated and analysed an artwork. There are many methods and types of materials you can create an artwork from. Below are lists of words that you could use to describe the methods and materials when identifying the media. Materials - paint (oil, acrylic, water based), ink, tempera, gold leaf, canvas, cloth, vellum, glass, photos, cardboard, postcards, plastic, wood, metal Methods - coiling, carving, melting, firing, joining, sewing Materials - clay, glass, paper, silver, gold, wood, plastic, gemstones, feathers, silk, cotton, leather, tiles Methods - drawing, montage, illustrating, advertising, marketing, packaging, make up, hairstyles, tailoring Some artists use unconventional materials in their artwork, for example Chris Ofili included elephant dung in his artwork entitled 'She'. Visit the Main Gallery - Patterns to see his work. Other British artists who have used unconventional materials include Tracey Emin and Damien Hirst.	6

What is the subject matter of the art, craft or design work you are studying? How can it be described? The 'S' of SEMI stands for 'Subject'. Subject is the first element of the SEMI approach. The words you use to describe the subject matter of a piece of art, craft or design work will depend on the individual work. Figures - man, woman, child, groups of people, royalty, religious figures, families, people in love, people at war Scenes - everyday life, worship, at war, working, sleeping, posing, storytelling Animals - moving, static domestic pets, groups Objects - the still life, everyday objects, food and drink, plants, the landscape, personal belongings, religious artefacts, symbols and signs Abstract - colours, shapes, geometric, patterns, suggestive, mood, emotion, dark, light, powerful, subtle Organic shapes - flowers, stems, petals, flowing, curving, interlocking, curved Design - lettering, text, signs and symbols Purpose - clothes, shoes, hats, jewellery, furniture, houses and buildings, bridges, fabric, wallpaper, designs for print, logos, posters Organic shapes - anatomical, flowers, stems, petals, flowing, curving, interlocking, curved Design - lettering, text, blocks, patterns Human experience - memories, stories, myths and legends, religious, everyday Site-specific - environmental, practical, scientific, aesthetic Now that you have looked through the lists of words that help identify the subjects in art, craft and design have a go at this activity.

The SEMI approach will help you get your ideas straight about all kinds of art, craft and design work - it's just what you need for your assessment objective 2 (AO2). The SEMI approach will help you get good marks for AO2. All art, craft and design work can be described using three or four of these headings. Here's an example of how it works. Here is Duncan Grant's painting 'Garden Path in Spring'. Here is a SEMI analysis of the painting. Now you've got the idea, we'll look at each of the headings in detail in the next four Revision Bites. Follow these links, or find the list on the index page.	6
If you are using oil paint [oil paint: A powdered pigment that is held together with linseed oil. ], you can experiment with thick and thin areas to create textures. You might want a shiny or matt surface. By adding turpentine to the mix, you can make the paint thinner, more transparent and have a more matt finish. By adding oil (such as linseed or poppy oil) you make the paint thinner, more transparent and give it a more glossy finish. Adding wax will give a soft matt finish and make the paint thicker too. Acrylic paint can be mixed with anything water based, such as water, soap, PVA glue and other water based paint. It can be applied thin or thick. You can try mixing in an acrylic medium to make the paint more transparent. This is useful for glazing effects and more subtle colouring. Water colour and gouache paints are both water based, so like acrylic they can be mixed with anything water based. You should experiment with the surface you are painting on. Try wood, paper, card, glass or metal. Create a collage, cut into the surface, or tear the paper and rejoin it in a different way. Surfaces can be changed in a variety of ways, scratched, roughened, made uneven or smoothed. Try using sandpaper to remove some of the paint from previous painting and then paint onto it some more. Try painting onto a wet surface, and a dry surface. Try painting over old painting once it's dry. You can be surprised how good the results can be. Make use of a palette knife to discover new textures, or draw into the paint with the wrong end of your paintbrush. Try adding things such as glue, rice or sand onto, or into, the paint to build up or create a variety of interesting textures. Try different sizes and shapes of brushes. Decorating brushes are a cheap alternative to large artist quality brushes. Try painting without brushes, using pieces of wood or plastic as scrapers, or bits of rag to apply the paint. When you are experimenting have an idea in mind of what you want to achieve, and then see what techniques give you the most success. Research the work of other painters to get some ideas of what you can do. You could also research the medium, so to continue with the previous example you could find out about oil paints. Information about -	6
You can explore a range of materials on which to draw, such as different thicknesses, types and textures of paper. Experiment to see the difference it makes what type of marks you use to draw the same subject. Try making marks that are all the same all over. Then try to get a wide range of different marks into the same drawing. Use wet and dry mediamedia: a collective name for images, video and audio. Try drawing with wet media like watercolours, ink or watered-down acrylic paint. Try different mark-making materials from pencils to pastels, inks, pens, charcoal, sticks, matches. Try fine aquarelle pencils for subtle colour blending, or make a delicate wash by brushing over them with water. Try using different types of eraser. Try using erasers to make marks and remove parts of the drawing. Putty rubbers are very soft and can be used to lighten shadows, to give delicate shading, by rubbing gently at areas you've already shaded. Try rubbing out an area and then drawing back into the mess that is left behind. Adrian, Helen and Marian explain why they enjoy drawing with different materials.	6
When creating a collage [collage: A collage is an image that is made up of a mixture of materials, such as newspaper, magazine cuttings, string and so on. ] try to experiment with a variety of materials - paper, string, plastics, bits of wood, plaster, tissues - in fact almost anything. Then try to have fun with the materials you've chosen. You could photocopy photos, official documents, letters, certificates, newspapers, magazines or use the real ones. Consider tearing the papers, layering them, scrunching them up into balls, folding them to create ridges or bending them to create waves. Look at artists such as Robert Rauschenberg (shown here), Henri Matisse, Pablo Picasso, Kurt Schwitters, Eva Hesse, or Jasper Johns for inspiration. Karimah experimented with lots of different media and techniques. See her work in this Revision Bite: Developing ideas. Try out the Museum of Modern Art's interactive online activity 'Remix - an interactive collage': http://redstudio.moma.org/interactives/remix/index_f.html	6
If you are working in 3D, you might use materials you can model, carve or construct. These could be plaster of Paris, modroc (plaster bandage), wire, chicken wire, wood, cardboard, or clay. You need to consider the reason for choosing a particular material, what it might be used for, and how you would use it. You'll also need to think about the finish - will it be glazed or covered with papier-mÃ¢chÃ©? It might be that you are casting from your hand or foot, or you want to create a piece based on the body. Before you make it full size, try out a few experiments. Mix the plaster and pour into a plastic ice cream tub. When it is cool and solid, take it out - it's now ready to carve. Plaster of Paris is relatively soft and so itâ€™s easy to carve with a knife or metal clay tools. You can also use shaping/smoothing tools such as a surform. Experiment with images and plaster of Paris by putting things such as photos or text in the bottom of something shallow. For example, take a plastic glue top/lid, mix the plaster and pour over the photo. When it sets, take the solid plaster out of the lid. Casts can be made by using plaster bandage or by pouring plaster into a mould, or over your hand/foot. Remember that you need to cover your hand with petroleum jelly (vaseline) to stop the plaster sticking to you! You also need to build a wall around the area that is to be cast, to stop the plaster running away. Look at the different ways in which artists such as Rachel Whiteread, George Segal, Rose Garrard, and Henry Moore have used plaster of Paris. See Rachel Whiteread, George Segal and Henry Moore artworks in the Main Gallery - Sculpture.	6
Still Life, 1914, Pablo Picasso Click on the images below to see a bigger version. (If you have Flash, click Magnify to see the detail - to remove the viewfinder just click Magnify again.) Â© Artist, Photo Courtesy of MuHKA - Belgium Self Portrait, 1982, Tony Cragg In his 'Self Portrait' piece (shown here) you can see he has used bits of plastic including a spatula, a flip flop and felt tips pens. Try collecting different materials and experiment with them in different ways to see what you can do. For example, try organising them by texture, shape, colour or symbolism. Find out more about Shape and Form in the Revision Bite: Visual and tactile elements.	6
Hew Locke uses materials like thick card and coloured plastics to construct his pieces. He cuts, twists, tears and sticks the pieces together to construct sculptures or hangings. Laura Ford starts with a metal armature [armature: A framework used to give a rigid support to a sculpture. It is often made from metal or wire and can be padded with paper or wood. ]. She talks us through her creative process. Tom Hill uses his initial sketches to create objects such as chickens, fish and birds in wire.	6
Chicken wire or wire mesh can be used to shape and form. It can be shaped over a tailor's dummy, for example, to make a body or torso structure. This can then be covered with papier mÃ¢chÃ©, fabrics, or plaster. Experiment with small pieces of wire mesh, then cover it with photocopies, fabrics, papier mÃ¢chÃ© or any other material you fancy using. Watch these video clips showing how Jenni Dutton makes dresses using chicken wire and decorates shoes with various materials like broken glass. Jenni talks about the creative process involved in making dresses. In this clip she showcases 'Holly Dress' and 'Hair Dress'. In this clip Jenni talks about the 'Mackerel Corset' and why she chose to use mackerel skins. Apart from dresses and corsets, Jenni also creates shoes. Here she talks about the 'Queen of Sheba's Shoe'. Watch more video clips in Artists explanations and SEMI Gallery - Video clips.	6
You can decorate by drawing into or onto the surface with tools such as needles or knives. Textures can be made by pressing the clay onto a textured surface such as a rubber car mat or a brick wall. Consider the colour and final look of the piece. You might want to paint areas or make patterns with coloured slips. Experiment with glaze/colour tests before deciding what to put onto your work. Remember that you can spoil a beautiful piece of work with the wrong type of glaze. The colour, whether matt or shiny, needs to be planned and well thought out. Kate Malone uses very particular glazes for her work. She has spent years developing her knowledge and understanding. Look at the Revision Bite: Developing ideas to see how our student Shreya has used layers of pattern and colour on her Mehendi [Mehendi: A temporary henna tattoo artistically and skillfully applied onto the body. Traditionally this is applied onto hands, forearms, lower legs and feet. ] hand piece. She painted each layer separately and fired it more than six times. Remember glazes are a form of liquid glass. They can be mixed with water from dry ingredients or they might come in liquid form and be stored in small containers. The finished effect from using a glaze can be transparent, opaque, shiny or matt. Glazes can enhance your work or ruin it. So it is really important that you try to learn how to use them to their best advantage. This takes trial and error and some research. Ask your teacher for guidance. Keep notes of your experiments, so that if you have a good or interesting result you can re-use it.	6
In this Revision Bite you'll find some more ideas and examples to help you experiment with media, and to write up your results for AO3. The reason you need to experiment with media is to see what's most suitable for your ideas - and you won't know until you've tried it! Karman experimented with a variety of media. Her experiments with print led to her drawings/sketches, where she planned her thoughts and compositional arrangements. She made a few textile samples to test her ideas and the colours that she might use before she made her final pieces. See Karman's experimentation in her work journal. Lindsay was having difficulties with his theme. It wasn't until he changed the materials and techniques that he was using and began to paint, that his work began to go in a direction that interested him, stimulated new ideas and resulted in a good standard of work. Lindsay's background notes and sketches Tom Hill, a wire sculptor, talks about the stages of his idea development, from drawing to sculpting. Grayson Perry, ceramicist, talks about how he draws ideas from emotional events to incorporate into the themes for his vases. Faisal Abdu'allah talks us through his appreciation for Renaissance paintings and how he uses this inspiration to create works like 'Madonna and Child' as shown here. Jenni Dutton, textile artist, talks about how myths and legends inspire her. She also explains how initially she was interested in forms of wrapping before moving on to creating dresses out of unusual materials.	6
Lots of different things can trigger ideas - especially the work of other artists. Experimenting with ideas - using as many different materials and processes as come to mind - is an important part of making art. This Revision Bite shows you how a whole range of different artists and designers have experimented in their work - can they help you with your ideas? Fiona Rae works on many pieces of art at the same time. This allows her to reflect on her decisions, make amendments or remove ideas from her work. Paula Rego talks about her decisions on who will become the focus in the painting she is creating. Find out more about Fiona Rae and Paula Rego in the Artist Explanations and SEMI Gallery.	6
Artists, designers, and craftspeople have always experimented with media and techniques. You can get ideas from watching them making something, or read about their ways of working. There are lots artists who use many kinds of materials and media and include found objects in their work:Tracey Emin, Rebecca Horn, Cornelia Parker, Jasper Johns, Tony Cragg, Chris Ofili, Natasha Kerr, Michael Brennand-Wood, Damian Hirst and Annie Turner Jenni Dutton talks about how she was interested in the theme of wrapping and how she developed that idea to create dresses and shoes from unusual materials such as mackerel skins and love letters. Looking at other artists can help you to develop your ideas and experiments. Take a look at the Main Gallery to see works by Chris Ofili, Rebecca Horn and Tony Cragg.

We have split Gamze's work journal into two halves, so you can see her research development and then the final ceramic pieces she created. See Gamze's preparation studies. She started work by studying things from the sea from first-hand experience. She looked at shells, coral, fish, sea creatures, seaweed etc, and used water colours, pen and pencil. One of Gamze's preparation studies Gamze looked at pictures of sea life in books, and at artwork by different artists. She planned to work in ceramics and so she also looked at the work of ceramicists like Kate Malone. Gamze also developed her ideas by looking at work from different times and places in the British Museum and the Victoria and Albert Museum in London.

An example of work from Karimah's journal In the extract from Karimah's work journal, shown below, you will see how she has explained her work to others. This was a statement she included with her exhibition of coursework. Along with her other notes and explanations, she was able to help others understand how she had developed her ideas and work. It's an important part of AO3 to develop and explore your ideas, like Karimah has done. Write your progress in your work journal, so the examiner knows how your work has progressed. My art exhibition shows a series of artwork that I have created which all deal with my journey from Nigeria to England. During the term, I have created a series of art pieces that concentrate on the theme of 'Identity'. In the art pieces, I explore the journey that I have made from Nigeria to live in England. The reason that I have focused on this subject under the title of 'Identity' is because, the journey I have made was a life changing journey and it is a significant part of my identity. I first started exploring this journey by creating self portraits, this was to develop my skills and ideas in art to help me to become more advanced. I then planned and created a collage of Africa. This collage shows the journey that I made to England from Nigeria, through symbols, colours and pictures used to represent the contrasting countries. The main elements that I included in my collage work is that England has a cool calm atmosphere and climate whilst Nigeria is hot and roars with excitement and noise. Nigeria has a beautiful collection of exotic animals that run wild and free, whilst in England the animals are locked up in a zoo. The environment in England is clean and fresh but in Nigeria, it is dirty and humid. I chose to show my journey this way because it is an effective way of showing the striking difference between England and Nigeria. After the first collage I realised that collage is my strongest point in art and I began to produce a series of mixed media pieces that featured collage. 'Tree of Life' is a piece where I used a symbol of a tree to represent my life growing out of a symbol of Africa. In 'The first self portrait collage' I used maps to show the physical part of my journey. 'The second self portrait collage', is a piece where I used the different flags of England and Nigeria to show my journey and the comparison between England and Nigeria. I have linked my theme of 'Identity', with numerous artists because they have all been exploring a similar theme to me. Gerard Quenum is an African artist who uses dolls to symbolise identity, Richard Long, an artist who expresses his journeys through photographs, Louise Bourgeois who deals with her identity by using memories of her childhood, Frida Khalo a Mexican artist who uses powerful images to show her identity and Henri Matisse who uses his knowledge of African art and refines it into a simpler form in his pieces of art. I have been to the National Gallery, the Tate Modern, the October Gallery, the Century City exhibition and the library to learn about artists that may have connections with my theme. I have been exploring my cultural and family background through family photographs. This is because the photographs prompt ideas for units of work and they tell different stories through the atmosphere or pose in the picture. The journey in the art pieces is presented in mixed styles of aboriginal art and African art. I do this to experiment with the different ways of presenting my journey to viewers and to give a variation in the techniques and arts styles that I use. My progress whilst creating units of artwork has improved dramatically compared to the beginning of term where I was unable to develop and explore ideas. Overall, I am pleased with the way that I have managed to link all my units of artwork together all under the topic of 'Identity'. I have improved my art skills from the beginning of the term, when I had very little art skills. I am glad that I can now expand and explore ideas, compared to when I first started art and I could not develop an idea because of lack of experience and knowledge of art.	6
Shreya used a variety of materials to develop her ideas for Mehendi [Mehendi: A temporary henna tattoo artistically and skillfully applied onto the body.

Look through Shreya's ideas and theme development in the work journal above. See how she developed her thinking from the theme 'Identity' and her Indian heritage through to her Mehendi hand-inspired bowl. She also experimented with glazes and shapes before deciding on her final idea. Shreya's final piece Artists occasionally use their own experiences of life (or sometimes of others), refer to their cultural background or include something they found in their work.

Gerard Quenum is an African artist who uses dolls to symbolise identity, Richard Long, an artist who expresses his journeys through photographs, Louise Bourgeois who deals with her identity by using memories of her childhood, Frida Khalo a Mexican artist who uses powerful images to show her identity and Henri Matisse who uses his knowledge of African art and refines it into a simpler form in his pieces of art. I have been to the National Gallery, the Tate Modern, the October Gallery, the Century City exhibition and the library to learn about artists that may have connections with my theme. I have been exploring my cultural and family background through family photographs. This is because the photographs prompt ideas for units of work and they tell different stories through the atmosphere or pose in the picture. The journey in the art pieces is presented in mixed styles of aboriginal art and African art. I do this to experiment with the different ways of presenting my journey to viewers and to give a variation in the techniques and arts styles that I use. My progress whilst creating units of artwork has improved dramatically compared to the beginning of term where I was unable to develop and explore ideas. Overall, I am pleased with the way that I have managed to link all my units of artwork together all under the topic of 'Identity'. I have improved my art skills from the beginning of the term, when I had very little art skills. I am glad that I can now expand and explore ideas, compared to when I first started art and I could not develop an idea because of lack of experience and knowledge of art. Shreya used a variety of materials to develop her ideas for Mehendi [Mehendi: A temporary henna tattoo artistically and skillfully applied onto the body. Traditionally this is applied onto hands, forearms, lower legs and feet. ]-inspired bowl. She made links to her own culture and developed her ideas by studying art from India. Look through Shreya's ideas and theme development in the work journal above. See how she developed her thinking from the theme 'Identity' and her Indian heritage through to her Mehendi hand-inspired bowl. She also experimented with glazes and shapes before deciding on her final idea. Shreya's final piece Artists occasionally use their own experiences of life (or sometimes of others), refer to their cultural background or include something they found in their work. Take a look at Backa Carin's 'Corridor' and find out more about the personal experience that inspired her in the Artist Explanations and SEMI Gallery. Watch the video clips about Annie Turner as she explains how she gets her inspiration from the local environment and the objects she finds in Other Artist explanations and Video Clips.	6
The more you experiment, the more your work will stand out. Take risks with the media you are using, to really show off your creativity. As you experiment, you'll find you have more success, and the more your confidence will grow. You can then start to break the rules or make up your own rules. Try using materials in unusual ways and combining different papers and cards with pencils, chalk, inks or paint. You can also use things such as sponges, straws or various types of brushes to get different effects with paint. For example this picture below was created by drawing onto sandpaper with wax crayon and then ironing this onto a clean sheet of cartridge paper to create an impressionist effect. These effects were created using ink and tea streaked onto paper. Experiment with other unusual materials and try layering them on top of one another.	6
Creating a mixed media artwork involves overlaying materials, colours or tones. They can be both 2D and 3D. Take a look at Picasso's work below. He has used painted wood and upholstery fringe.

Still Life, 1914, Pablo Picasso Other great artists, such as Leonardo da Vinci, Gustav Klimt, Edgar Degas and George Braque, also used mixed media techniques. Can you find out what materials they used? For example, here's some information about how Leonardo Da Vinci experimented with new materials for his fresco 'The Last Supper': http://arthistory.about.com/cs/leonardo/a/last_supper.htm	6
Hew Locke is a mixed media artist. The materials he makes use of are brightly coloured and glittery - toothpics, sequins, feather boas and so on. You can find out more about Hew Lock here: http://www.hewlocke.net Barr Lewis is a Canadian artist who creates mixed media artworks. Her site: www.colorandpassion.com includes information about the materials she uses. The artist has also included an art project page which details how you can create a mixed media miniature figurative relief: www.syzygyartgallery.com	6
Have a look at work by different photographers who use different styles and subject matters. Look at those who have worked in different historic times, or in unusual places. Developing on from this idea, you could study photo journalists, and work out how they might structure a story. Martin Parr talks about why he enjoys photography, and takes us through his creative process. Take a look at some of the artists we have featured in our Main Gallery - Photography page. Find out more about Martin Parr in the Artist Explanations and SEMI Gallery.	6
AO3 is all about experimenting - but you can't start on that until you've found a theme that inspires you. This Revision Bite should help you find subjects you can really go to town on. You can get lots of ideas by making a spidergram, mindmap or flowchart. Don't stop until there's nothing left to write, however strange the connections you make! Write the theme your teacher has given you in the middle of a piece of paper. Then just see what that theme makes you think about. Whatever it is, write it down, and then see what that makes you think about next. Just let each idea connect in some way with the next. Let your ideas flow. Don't worry that they might seem silly. Have a look at Shreya and Kathy's spidergrams below for examples of the start of a spidergram - click on them to see a bigger version.

An example of Kathy's preparation studies See more of Kathy's work journal. It's good to visit museums or galleries and look for artists who might have worked on themes like yours. Visit the Main Gallery and the Artist Explanations and SEMI Gallery for more ideas. Georgie and Helen discuss the artists that inspired their working methods. Georgie visits a gallery to get artistic inspiration. Georgie discusses the artists that inspire her and Max discusses the everyday objects that inspire him.	6
Ideas need to be developed and refined. Making notes about how you've changed and improved your ideas can help both you and the examiner understand your work. Watch the video clips featuring Fiona Rae and Paula Rego as they talk about this below. Paula Rego talks about her decisions on who will become the focus in the painting she is creating. Fiona Rae works on many pieces of art at the same time. This allows her to reflect on her decisions, make amendments or remove ideas from her work. Watch the video clips below of the students that we featured in the Bitesize Art and Design programme as they talk about how they review and refine their ideas. Helen talks about how she wrote her experiments and evaluations into her journal and how these notes were useful when she created her final piece. Reema, Georgie and Helen talk about how they used the information thay had recorded in their journals to modify and refine their ideas for their final piece.	6
The way your work looks is very important for your final grade. You'll need to explain the ideas you've had while exploring a particular theme. Can you show how these have inspired you, as you've worked towards your final piece? Remember, whether you choose a work journal [work journal: A book in which a daily record of things that have happened is kept. An alternative name for a sketchbook or log book. If you divide your preparation work up, it will be easier to make sure you're doing everything you need to do. For example you could use one display board, or three or four pages of a sketchbook, for each assessment objective. Don't forget you'll need to do this for each piece of work you submit. If you're using work journals, we'd suggest that you have one for each piece of coursework.	6
"Think about how you show others your work. These layout tips can be used in your displays as well as your work journals. Space your work out evenly and don't be afraid to leave some white space. Make use of imaginary vertical and horizontals lines to make the layout look tidy. You can overlay images if you want, but be careful not to let your work become too cluttered. Sample layout using a ""washing line"" Use the ""washing line"" idea. Hang your work from an imaginary horizontal line. This also works with a strong vertical line. Sample layout with a ""horizon"" Create a ""horizon"" in the display . Make sure that all your work goes above and below the imaginary horizontal line. This will also works with a vertical line. Don't display your work at angles without being sure that's right. It usually isn't. It can make your work look untidy and doesn't help the viewer when they are trying to see your work development."	6
As part of each project, you have to describe your art or design work. This is where you explain your ideas, and show you've done all your coursework. it needs to be clear that you kept assessing what you were doing while you were doing it, to show how your ideas moved along. Make rough notes when you do work of any kind. You need to show evidence of what you have learned. It's easier to record things while you are working than at the end of your project. Here are some questions to help you with your written comments - plus some phrases you could use for your answers. Explain how your theme has changed or developed. What new ideas have you had? Helen's theme is 'Overhead and Underneath'. She talks about how she experimented with different techniques before choosing one to use in her final piece.	6
"Use words such as inspired, interested, fascinated, provoked, shocked, disturbed, discovered and explored, to show that the artist's or craftsperson's work has really helped you to create your own artwork. These kinds of words are good because they sound personal and express what you mean. Page about Frida Kahlo from a student's work journal This student writes about how she was disturbed by Frida Kahlo's ""scary"" self portraits. Frida Kahlo had to go through a lot surgery after a pole pierced through her body in a bus accident. The student has seen photos of Frida Kahlo, and thinks she was pretty but must have thought of herself as ugly after the accident. After studying these portraits in detail, the student had re-occuring dreams, which influenced the work she later created. For example, if you make a comment about an artist's use of colour, have a go at mixing those colours in paint yourself and stick them alongside your written comment. These colours might then be used later on in your own work. This student has drawn the throat of sheep in an aboriginal style. Using earthy colours and lines he explains how this result reminds him of ""a zebra because of its striping pattern""."	6
Don't just look at the obvious. Broaden your research to include craftworkers, designers, contemporary art and art forms from across the world. The artwork that you look at can come from a wide range of sources. For example, looking at your next-door neighbour's paintings is just as valid as looking at the work of a famous artist from the Tate Modern gallery in London. What's important is what you learn and how an artist helps you to develop your ideas and make connections. Take a look at the Artist Explanations and SEMI Gallery, the BBC's Art website, bbc.co.uk/arts, for more information or try an online search. It's very important to look at other artists' work to get ideas, but you must not copy their artwork and use it as your own final piece. You need to show evidence that looking at artists' work has helped you to develop your ideas and inspired you in some way to create your final piece of work.	6
You might choose to use a colour range inspired by an artist's use of colour in a painting or sculpture. You may choose to create a painting using the same brush strokes as your chosen artist. You could show your study skills by experimenting with different art periods as shown in the activity above. Your choice may reflect an artist's composition. For example, a magnified view, an oddly shaped paper or a similarly structured sculpture. An artist may specialise in a particular subject. For example, natural forms, mechanical forms, the body, portraiture, fruit, flowers, animals, landscape or still life. You may also choose to specialise. Try to identify what the artist you have been inspired is passionate about. Here are some ideas: recycling, women's issues, emotions, scale, using found objects, the banality of everyday life, violence, unusual lighting or viewpoints and so on. For example, you might choose to do a still life with similar objects used by the artist you are inspired by. A theme that creates the opposite effect to that of your artist.	6
You have to show what you can achieve within the 10 hour exam. This needs to be work done from scratch and completed under exam conditions - starting with a blank sheet of paper, blank canvas, lump of clay, etc. Think about what media you can prepare before the day of the exam. You should do as much as possible to make those 10 hours run as smoothly as possible. If you are going to use any unusual materials, check in advance that they can be brought in for you, otherwise you'll need to bring them in yourself. Also double check that there'll be enough equipment to go around. For more preparation tips read Revision Bite: The final exam - Preparing for the timed test	6
Once you know your theme for any unit of coursework or for your final exam, you need to think about the four assessment objectives (AO1, AO2, AO3 and AO4). As you follow the assessment objectives, you'll be brainstorming, researching and experimenting with ideas (AO1, AO2, AO3). You'll be recording all this in your work journal, and preparing to make your final art work or object for AO4. In each unit you do for GCSE Art and Design, you need to combine the four 'assessment objectives' together to form one large volume of work. Here's how to approach them. Start with some ideas about your theme. Choose your theme and group as many ideas about it as you can - perhaps in a spidergram. Try bouncing ideas off your friends or looking up word associations in a thesaurus or subject associations in an encyclopedia. These ideas will help you with the next stage. For fuller details, see the main Assessment Objectives units.	6

For your GCSE Art and Design coursework you can follow the 'endorsed' or 'unendorsed' course. They're both marked in the same way. If you're doing a full GCSE in Art and Design, whether endorsed or unendorsed, you'll do two, three or four units of coursework - it will depend on the exam board. Your teacher will decide the unit topics - they could be something like 'Natural forms', or 'Me, myself'. Your 'controlled test', or final exam, comes at the end of the course. It takes ten hours, and you'll do it over two or more days. You get between four and eight weeks to prepare for this, depending on your exam board. This is a broad-based course, so you work in two or more areas of study. You need to produce coursework that covers at least two of the areas of study listed below. This is a specialised course, so you work in only one area of study for the whole course. You need to produce coursework that covers just one area listed below. If you choose to do two endorsements, you'll get two GCSEs!	6
Coursework + final exam = GCSE! Remember to find out which examination board you're following - your teacher will tell you. The number of coursework units you need to do, and the amount of time you get to prepare in before your final exam, depends on your board. Coursework can give you up to 60 per cent of your marks. A coursework unit should include all the work you did while preparing your final piece or pieces. The controlled test can give you 40 per cent of your marks. You will need to respond to one starting point, or title.	6
The coursework you do in the build-up towards the final exam is very important - it can count for 60 per cent of your GCSE mark! So remember to label your coursework carefully, and to keep it safe. Coursework is made up from all the work you do in your two-year GCSE course. It will include your work journals, sketchbooks, or log books, plus your supporting studies, developmental pieces, written notes and final pieces of work. It does not include the final exam. Remember coursework is worth 60 per cent of your final overall GCSE mark, and the final exam is worth 40 per cent. If you don't know which exam board you're following - ask your teacher. Your teacher will give you the starting point or title for each unit of coursework you're doing. Each unit is made up of a body of work that must cover and link all four assessment objectives together. Here's a reminder of what they are. AO1 - Record and observe AO2 - Analyse and evaluate AO3 - Develop and explore your ideas AO4 - Personal response	6
Everything you do in art is assessed. At the end of the course you may want to leave out some of your work, but only do this if your teacher agrees - it might be more useful than you think. Even unfinished or unsuccessful pieces can be very useful to show that you tried something. Failed experiments are good evidence of your research. So don't throw away any work, however embarrassing you think it is, before asking your teacher's advice. Remember your coursework mark is made up of the sum of all your units of work, and is worth 60 per cent of your final GCSE grade. Anyone who has never made a mistake has never tried anything new. Half of art is accident, but there is no accident without free experiment. The best place to store all your artwork is probably in your art drawer at school, or you could put it in a large folder to keep it safe. If you think you might do a higher course in art and design, then an A1 portfolio would be worth buying. Keep three-dimensional work on a high shelf or in a storeroom. If in doubt, ask your art teacher. You need to be extra careful with ceramic work, because this is very fragile. Make sure you always take photographs of your ceramic work before and after it's put in the kiln. Write your name on the back of your work. Everything - written notes, your work journals, little pieces of paper and photographs - should be neatly and clearly labelled. Three-dimensional work also needs careful labelling. Put small stickers on the underside, or carefully write your name in pencil.	6
The work you do as you prepare to make your art, craft or design object needs to be recorded in a work journal, log or sketchbook. This work is called your preparation studies. It's more important than your final pieces, because it shows the examiners that all the assessment objectives have been met. This Revision Bite will help you get it right. Whatever you call it (we've called it a work journal), preparation studies are worth around 75 per cent of your overall GCSE mark. Your preparation work for the assessment objectives is more important than your final piece. So do look at Assessment objectives in your course. Preparation studies support each of your units of work, and should show that all the assessment objectives have been met. The size of your work journal is up to you and your art teacher. You could have several work journals if you wanted. In some schools you do all the preparation work on large sheets of paper, and bind them together at the end.	6
Have a look at the page from a student's work journal shown below. It's important to pay attention to detail. Try to make the pages in your work journal really interesting!.

Each exam board calls the final exam a different name - terminal exam, external examination or controlled test. The exam is worth 40 per cent of your GCSE mark. Make sure you know which exam board you're following, so you know what the chosen theme is, and how many weeks you've got to prepare in. The final exam is a ten-hour exam, and it's worth 40 per cent of your total GCSE marks. You'll have between four and eight weeks preparation time before it - depending on your exam board. If you don't know which exam board you're following - ask your teacher! You must respond to one starting point - your exam board sets the exam titles. You choose one starting point in your chosen option - there are separate papers for each option. Now is not the time to try something new. If you've never done ceramics before - then don't do it now! Remember this is the final exam, a chance to gain 40 per cent of your overall GCSE marks. Be confident and ambitious - but stick with what you've done in your preparation studies.	6
Kate's brainstorm. Once you know your theme, get going with your preparation studies - as you do this, make sure you cover all four assessment objectives. All this should be done in the weeks before you make your final examination piece. Once it's finished, you'll show final outcome(s) and connect your work to the work of others. Remember - you'll have ten hours to create your final examination piece. Visit Your coursework and final exam to see how many preparation weeks your exam board gives you.	6

Alan Davie is a prominent Scottish artist well known for his work in a range of mediums including drawing, painting, and screenprinting. He was born in 1920 and graduated from the Edinburgh Royal College of Art in 1940. After serving in World War II he began teaching in Edinburgh and in 1947 became a professional jazz musician. In 1948 he took up a travelling art scholarship from the college and travelled throughout Europe in 1948-9. In Venice he met Peggy Guggenheim, an influential art collector, who introduced him to American abstract expressionism. Whilst exhibiting in New York in 1956 he befriended other artists including Jackson Pollock, Willem De Kooning and Mark Rothko. His work continues to be widely exhibited across the USA and Europe. Much of Alan's work is colourful, vibrant, on a large scale and reflects the artist's love of jazz music, non-western cultural symbols, ancient religious and ethnic influences. My ideas are intuitive and most ideas come from my thoughts. The art I create is no way expressive or impressionist, it just comes from an artist drive I have to keep on creating. The work of art seems to be something thrown off, a by-product of the process of being and working. Art just happens, like falling in love. When I am working, I am aware of a striving, a yearning, the making of many impossible attempts at a kind of transmutation â€“ a searching for a formula for the magical conjuring of the unknowable. Many times the end seems just within reach, only to fly to pieces before me as I reach for it. I paint because I have nothing, or I paint because I am full of ideas ... or I paint because after I last painted, something appeared miraculously out of it. The titles are not necessarily directly linked to the image, they are more often terms I have to use to catalogue the artwork I have created. Inside is a place of magic; resounding, surrounding, where big hanging works in progress are constantly being transformed and re-worked, making a shifting environment of developing moods, spaces, colours, forms, poetry fragments, script, signs and symbols, laughing, singing.	6

Backa Carin was born in 1973 in Uppsala, Sweden. She graduated from Stockholm University College of Arts, Craft and Design in 2000 with a master's degree in fine art and has since worked as a professional artist. Her works have been exhibited internationally and in main galleries in Sweden. She creates installation pieces in porcelain and stoneware that often blur dreams and reality. The symbolic signs of dreams are astonishingly general. A lot of people recognise their own dreams when they see my work. She views her role as an artist as being similar to that of a set designer in that she engages the viewer to enter the artwork and become part of it. The installations are often on a large scale and incorporate movement, noise and light. My desire is to give the viewer an impression of life; the encounter between what is beautiful and horrible, the beauty and destructiveness of love, and the fact that we are immortal until we die. When I was about to start working on my Master of Fine Art project I had an intense dream. In this dream I was looking at the exhibition of all the MFA students' art projects. The artwork that was most interesting was a long corridor covered with tentacles. The impression of walking through it was pleasant and at the same time disgusting as the tentacles reached out almost touching your body. When I woke up I realized that the corridor should become my MFA artwork. The feeling of it, the size, material colour and expression was so real and clear in the dream all that was left for me to do was to make it. When creating the corridor artwork I tried to stay as close to the dream as possible. So the shape of the tiles had to be organic and skin like. The corridor bent round in my dream so I built walls to reflect this, the corridor had to be the same scale and shape as what I had seen in my dream. Since the material of the tentacles was porcelain in the dream I made several moulds of plaster and then poured porcelain clay in to them. I made around 400 tentacle tiles to create this installation. The greatest source of inspiration for me is just to keep working. One project leads to another like a chain of happenings. One artwork inspires me to a new one. My two children give me inspiration in the way that they help me see the building stones in life and how people develop from the very beginning. To see a little person explore life is very interesting and you learn a lot about yourself and humanity. Other sources of inspiration are my friends around me and the long discussions about everything. Love and death are also really important. Other artists that have influenced me in no particular order include Eva Hesse, Louise Borgouise, Gerhard Richter, Matthew Barney, Damien Hirst, Paul McCarthy, Mona Hatoum, among others. For me it is really simple: I can't do anything else. If I could do something else I would choose that. I think that to be an artist, living off what you create, you have to be a special kind of a person. It is not enough that you are talented. You have to be really intense in the creating process. The wish to create has to be stronger than all other wishes.	6

Born in 1950, Caroline graduated from the Leicester School of Art in 1969 and the Central School of Art and Design, London in 1972. Although Caroline trained as a jeweller she soon diversified into textiles and sculptural installations incorporating clothing as pieces of art which are not intended to be worn. Caroline uses garments to explore ideas about personal identity and the portrayal of hidden feelings and emotions. Her recent work concentrates not only on clothing and textiles but on the space around garments on the body and shadows. She has been exhibited widely throughout the world. Caroline was the winner of the Jerwood Prize for Applied Arts: Textiles in 1997. 'Dress with Holes' is part of a body of work I made using shadows as an integral part. Previous work had used the dress as a metaphor for a person, but with these works, I was using the play between object and image to refer to substantial and insubstantial elements. Shadows of people are both part of them and separate, perhaps the outermost visual boundary of someone, giving a likeness but more usually a distortion. There are many stories, like Peter Schlemihl or Peter Pan, about people trading their shadows with the devil or otherwise becoming separated and the subsequent struggle to reunite with it. My intention was to give the shadow equal attention to the dress. The silk of the dress was dyed a mid grey and was a lightweight, transparent fabric. Because the silk was so fine the shadow carried the details of overlaps, seams, creases. In the shadow, I painted the inside spaces of the dress on the wall behind, like the neck, cuffs and the hem, so it looks like there might be a lining to the shadow, give a sense of three-dimensions. I was also interested in the process of completing a work in the space it would be exhibited. These pieces depend on the theatrical nature of traditional art galleries - smooth white walls, controlled lighting. I always started with the light source and worked by placing the dress to get the right shadow.	6

"Kate has been a ceramicist for over 30 years. She remains fascinated with the creative process and likens the way clay can be transformed to a spirited, colourful and glazed vessel through firing to the growth of a tree from a seed. Her passion for ceramics was strengthened at high school, and experimentation with other art mediums strengthened her conviction that pottery was her natural vocation. The work Kate creates ranges in size from intricate palm-sized pieces to exuberant, bold pots large enough for children to sit in. She also creates a variety of work from public fountains to gallery installation pieces. Kate has become well known for her use of distinctive crystalline glazes on her work. The crystalline glazes produce crystal growth on the surface (as seen on 'Queen Pineapple'). The glazes can almost be bad taste as they are so glitzy and clever, like 80s disco wallpaper or jazzy wrapping paper. I myself enjoy kitsch and aim to sometimes offset crystal bad taste with kitsch â€“ thus marrying form and surface. At other times crystals can be gentle and extraordinarily delicate making them a fabulously versatile friend to have in the often difficult glaze department. Key influences on Kate's work are the natural world, fertility and the magic of growth, which she refers to as the ""life force"". Positive symbolism, fun and humour are also key to her work. Although most of Kate's pieces are based on natural forms, such as fruit and vegetables, she cites fashion designers Zandra Rhodes and Jean Muir as inspirations for the way she ""dresses up"" her pots. I prepare my clay very soft. I use T Material which usually arrives pretty hard, so I slice up a bag, make rows of wells in each slice, fill those with water, wait a few days and then wedge. I roll coils using both hands. I concentrate by closing my eyes and feeling the coil and reacting to it through touch alone. When I meet students who admit to not being able to roll a prefect coil I tell them to do it blindfold and get good reports back. You can not really see anything below your hands so you do really have to rely on touch alone to roll a coil. I adore rolling perfect soft long coils. I mix [glaze] very thick. I apply using a variety of brushes. I try to create forms that will work with the fluidity of the glaze, create pools for crystals to grow in, and shoulders and round rims and gulleys and valleys for them to slide off and show their trail of movement. I often use three to six different glazes on one surface and blob and layer them together in a series of patches. These overlap in areas and create other effects. I keep a record of the order in which I apply the different recipes as effects change if the order changes."	6

Maxine explains why she enjoys creating textile art and how her approach is different from other contemporary artists. Maxine Bristow is a textile artist. Born and educated in Lancashire, she studied textiles at Manchester Metropolitan University and now teaches at the University of Chester. Maxine's work is intricate, rooted in traditional needlecraft and demonstrates a high level of expertise. Much of her work is minimalist and on first glance the pieces evoke images of warmth and homeliness but on closer inspection the repetitiveness of the needlework becomes suffocating. Creativity is often seen as being intuitive and expressive, it's adventurous, it's exciting. The way I work is very laborious, very boring. Art doesn't have to be splashing paint around. There can be a lot of meaning, emotion and expression through things that are very ordered. You can express a lot through things that are quiet, are very still and are well made and thought through.

'Holly Dress' and 'Human Hair Dress'. 'Empty Dress' and 'Mackerel Corset'. 'Queen of Sheba's Shoes'. Jenni is a conceptual clothing artist who trained at St Martin's and the Byam Shaw School of Art in London. Using clothing, Jenni constructs pieces around body forms which can then be torn, burnt or bleached and then rebuilt. Jenni used to use to create suspended human figures made from wire and paper, but became more interested in the actual wrapping and so moved on to creating dresses and shoes. The reason I chose dresses is because it's such a strong symbol for women. The most unusual material Jenni has used for her art is mackerel skins, with these she created a mackerel skin corset. In the video clips below Jenni talks about the creation of the 'Holly Dress', 'Human Hair Dress', 'Empty Dress', 'Mackerel Corset' and the 'Queen of Sheba's Shoe'.	6
"Laura Ford talks about the creation of the 'Chintz Girls' and how she wanted to create movement in the pieces. ""For 'Head Thinkers' I made lots of drawings. I don't often draw out ideas as trying to make something from a drawing can be very frustrating."" Laura studied at the Bath School of Art and the Chelsea School of Art. She is well known for her surreal sculptures and prints. Laura Ford's work makes use of fantastical creatures, they are familiar and endearing: ""something you would want to cuddle."" The surrealist movement has influenced my work. When normal things transmute in a very dreamlike way they become something else."	6
Tom Hill talks about the stages of his idea development, from drawing to sculpting. Born in 1971 in Essex, Tom studied jewellery at Middlesex University. In Tom's work he uses steel wire to create 3-d sketches of wildlife, using steel wire in the same way as pen markings. Tom recreates the natural movement of wildlife in his pieces through reliance on carefully observed sketches. My interest in animals stems from me growing up in East Anglia. Drawing is important for all artists really or certainly should be. It's just the best way of processing visual information. Form is described by line, and so with drawing you're immediately looking at an object and transcribing it as a line on a page. I do view what I do as a kind of job. It's not a self indulgent thing of just sitting here and being really creative. You have to view it as a job, but on the other hand it's a really good job.	6
After sketching ideas into a book Rachel photocopies the ones she likes best, reorganises the elements and then photocopies the final composition onto acetate ready to be sewn onto fabric. Rachel Howard studied embroidery at the Royal College of Art and produces screen prints, embroidered wall hangings, and interior and fashion accessories. She draws inspiration from the ritual events of everyday life such as cooking, eating and household chores. Most of my fabrics I collect from charity shops because I can fill a whole bin bag full of stuff and it'll be very cheap. Also at these places I can often find quite horrific fabrics which I quite like. You can find unusual prints. The machine stitch is another way to create liveliness and texture. I use the sewing machine a bit like a pen. I select the different coloured threads and machine round the figure. I think of myself as a crafts person, a designer and an artist. I think I've got all three in my work. The artist is the drawing, the designer is the composition and the craftsperson is the making of it.	6
Justin Mortimer talks about what he thinks is a good portrait and why he enjoys using paints. He also talks about how he developed his portrait painting style. Here Justin paints a portrait of TV presenter Mik Scarlet. He talks about how he has interpreted the presenter's personality and put it onto the canvas. Justin is an acclaimed portrait painter. He was born in 1970 and studied at the Slade School of Art in London. He was the winner of BP Portrait Award and his subjects include HM The Queen and David Bowie. I think a really good portrait is a picture that reveals something about the person that is being painted, which not everybody knows, which even the person you're painting might not know. You'll have to express your own feelings about the sitter.	6
Susie MacMurray is a sculptor and installation artist. Her work makes use of diverse and unusual materials such as human hair, balloons, bird feathers and latex gloves. After a successful career as an orchestral musician, Susie graduated from Manchester Metropolitan University with a BA in sculpture in 2000 and an MA in Fine Art in 2001. Her work has been widely exhibited internationally. She combines university teaching and educational work at Manchester Art Galleries with time in her studio. Recent awards include the Abbey Harris Mural Fund Award in 2006 and the Research and Development Award from The Arts Council England in 2004. 'The Coil' was made in parallel with 'Maidenhair' which is human hair, french knitted in the same way. I was exploring scale and the extreme physical limits of my own body's ability to make work using an identical process. At one end of the scale [for 'The Coil'], I was using the thickest rope I could source. Scaffolding a giant wheel with pegs in it and having to go to the gym to build up enough upper body strength for the coil pieces. For 'Maidenhair', I was french-knitting in the same way but using a tiny bobbin, the smallest crochet hook and working so finely that I could hardly see what I was doing.	6

To understand a work of art or a beautiful object, you need to think about how the artist or the designer made it. This Revision Bite describes how some of the world's greatest artists and designers set about their work. Do you ever wonder about what an artist wants to say with his/her work? It often depends on how they approach it. Sometimes they'll work directly with their subject, at other times they'll jot down their ideas, or make sketches, before getting started. This preparation work is called a study. Da Vinci used a sketchbook [sketchbook: Evidence of the working process, the preparatory studies, the ideas and thinking behind them. Can be a book, loose pages, or information gathered in a box. ] to record his ideas. They contained detailed anatomical [anatomical: The structure of living things such as plants, people, animals. ] pictures of the human body. He based them on what he found when he dissected human and animal bodies, to help him understand how muscles and bones formed their shape. He also went to the country to study plants and the landscape [landscape: An expanse of natural scenery, trees, hills, lakes etc. ]. Some of his most famous works are based on the careful, delicate studies he drew in his sketchbooks. Click on the images below to see bigger versions of two of Leonardo's studies.

"You'll need some practical skills, like drawing, to do this course - and this Revision Bite gives you some tips to help you get started. Once you've gathered all your art materials - pencils (see next page to decide what you need), paints, cartridge paper, sturdy work journal - what happens next? ""Drawing is putting a line around an idea. - Henri Matisse"" Most projects start with collecting information from first-hand experience, and this means drawing! Draw objects, people and places around you. Or you could take your own photographs, and work from these. The starting point for a project could focus on your house or garden, the journey to school or the local park. You could start by looking at manufactured or natural forms. Look at objects gathered in the school art room or at home. Maybe look at metal car parts, springs and cogs, glass bottles, china plates and vases, flowers, shells, twisted pieces of bark - anything that's interesting. Then draw it. Look in a mirror. Draw yourself or your family and friends. If possible, try to visit museums, galleries and sites of special interest to gather inspiration and ideas. Experiment with lighting, angles and different viewpoints. Self-portrait by Mariko Zervos"	6
Place an object in front of you - consider a teapot, a vase of simple flowers or a detailed shell. Now try to draw a carefully observed study using the hand you don't usually use. (If you are right-handed then use your left, and if you're left handed, use your right). Work slowly and draw your object. Look really carefully and concentrate on the object, not the paper. You should end up with a detailed drawing that doesn't look exactly like your usual style. James's non-dominant hand drawing	6
Try doing a continuous line drawing of an object in front of you. Use a soft pencil such as a 2B pencil, or a fine line pen or biro (so you can't rub out). Draw carefully without ever taking your pen or pencil off the paper. You will have to go across your drawing or over the same line several times. Don't worry about 'messing it up'. It will all add to the special quality of the finished drawing. How accurate is the final drawing? That depends how accurately you worked. Do you like the results of the continuous line technique? It may be spider-like and a little shaky, but overall it can have a delicate feel. James's continuous line drawing Try drawing a continuous line drawing using your mouse at www.imokta.co.uk - you can even send your drawings to a friend.	6
To understand a work of art or a beautiful object, you need to know about its basic visual elements The visual elements [visual elements: The individual parts or elements that make up a piece of art, craft or design such as: line; tone; colour; shape; form; pattern; space; and texture. ] include line [line: A visual element. Line can be an outline, sketch, doodle or hatching. ], tone [tone: The mood or manner of a text or part of a text. The author's 'tone of voice' or way in which they expect to be understood. The emotional load carried by a text. ], colour [colour: A visual element. Red, blue and yellow are the primary colours from which all other colours can be made. Black and white aren't strictly considered to be colours. ], shape [shape: A visual element. Shape is the visual appearance of something. ], formform: A style of poem, with a particular pattern of rhythm, rhyme pattern or regular line length (eg sonnet, couplets or ballad)., pattern [pattern: A visual element. Pattern is a repeating artistic or decorative design. ], space [space: A visual element. Depth and distance helps create the idea of space. ] and texture [texture: A visual element. Texture is the way surfaces look and feel. ]. All art and design work will use several of these basic elements. In this activity you have to identify the visual elements. It'll get you thinking along the right lines when you look at the work of the artists in the next Revision Bite.	6
The UK economy is made up of many types of organisations which have different aims and perform different functions. This Revision Bite will help you understand the aims and activities of the private sector in the UK economy. The UK economy is a mixed economy [Mixed economy: An economy with both a public and private sector. ]. This means that it has a public sector [Public sector: Organisations controlled by the Government on behalf of the general population. ], and a private sector [Private sector: Businesses in this sector are owned by shareholders, individuals, sole traders or partnerships. ]. The aim of a business in the private sector is to survive by making a profit. This may be a sole-trader working alone, like a newsagent, or thousands of shareholders in a large Public Limited Company. Businesses gain a larger market-share [Market-share: Percentage of overall sales in an industry. ] by increasing the sales of their products against competitors. This may involve reducing prices. To win the loyalty of customers and encourage repeat sales [Repeat sales/business: Customers returning to buy from the same business. ], businesses need to be reliable and provide a quality service to their customers.	6
The activities of industry can be divided into stages - primary, secondary and tertiary production. These stages form the chain of production and provide consumers with the finished goods. This involves acquiring raw materials. For example, metals and coal have to be mined; oil drilled from the ground; rubber tapped from trees; foodstuffs farmed, and fish trawled. This is sometimes known as extractive production [Extractive production: Another term for primary production - farming, mining, fishing etc. ]. Is the manufacturing and assembly process. This involves converting raw materials into components, eg making plastics from oil, and assembling the product, eg building houses, bridges and roads. This refers to the commercial services [Commercial service: Support services for industry, eg banking. ] that support the production and distribution process, eg insurance, transport, advertising, warehousing and retail, teaching and health care.	6
Most exam questions will bebased on a case study, which provides a setting for business theory. If you are asked a question about business aims, look carefully at the information you are given about the business and the individuals involved. Jill and Chris decide to go into partnership together, and set up their own furniture making business. They don't have much business experience, but Jill is very good at designing and making furniture, and Chris has studied accounts. Explain what you think their main aims should be and give your reasons. When you have finished take a look at the sample answers on the next page.	6
Alex wrote: They are just starting out in business, so I think they should just try to survive. Maybe they can try to make a profit and expand later, when they have more money. Examiner's note Alex has given a basic answer to this question. He has shown that he understands the basic principles, but he has not gone into enough detail. This answer would probably get an 'E' grade. Jesse wrote: I think they should try to survive first, because they probably don't have much money. They should make sure their furniture is good, so customers come back. If they make a profit, they can then try to expand their business. Examiner's note Jesse has answered the question quite well, and given good reasons. She has shown that she understands the subject. She could however, give better explanations, and use more business terms to get a higher grade. This answer would probably get a 'C' grade.

They should also make sure they produce quality products, so that they get repeat sales, and a good reputation. If they start to make a profit, and sales go well, they might want to employ someone to help increase output. Then they might try to increase their market-share. Examiner's note Sanjay has given an excellent answer. He has shown that he knows the facts and understands the subject. He has also given good reasons, and used business terms like repeat sales and market-share. This answer would probably get an 'A' grade.	6

There are two types of limited companies in the UK: private and public. This Revision Bite will help you understand the features, advantages and disadvantages of each. All limited companies are incorporated [Incorporated: A firm with a separate legal existence. ], which means they can sue or own assets in their own right. Their owners are not personally liable for the firm's debts (limited liability [Limited liability: Owners are not personally liable for debts. Their losses are limited to the amount they invested in the business. ]). The ownership of a limited company is divided up into equal parts called shares. Whoever owns one or more of these is called a shareholder [Shareholder: An individual investor who own part of a limited company. ]. A public limited company (PLC) can sell its shares on the Stock Market, while a private limited company (Ltd) cannot. Unlike a sole trader or a partnership, the owners of a limited company are not involved in the running of the business, unless they have been elected to the Board of Directors. To become a limited company, applicants have to submit a Memorandum of Association which states the business' name, address and main purpose. It also describes the liability and amount of capital [Capital: Money (or assets). ] invested. The internal workings of the company including the number of directors, how they are elected and what their roles are described in The Articles. This also describes how profits will be divided. When the Memorandum of Association have been submitted the Registrar of Companies issues a Certificate of Incorporation which allows a limited company to begin trading. A public limited company first has to raise sufficient capital, through selling its shares to the public. It has to produce a prospectus, which explains how the business is run, and what it intends to do in the future. Once all this has been done, the Registrar issues a Trading Certificate, which allows the newly formed PLC to start trading.	6
In general, both types of company must audit [Audit: An independent check on the accounts of a company. ] their accounts, and have them available for inspection. There are, however, exceptions to this rule for smaller private limited companies. Both types of company must indicate their status in their name, usually by using the abbreviation PLC or Ltd. This lets traders know that their liability is limited and that debts cannot be recovered from the personal funds of the company shareholders [Shareholders: Individual investors who own part of a limited company. ]. The exam will give you an opportunity to show your understanding of real-life businesssituations. The examiner will want to see you using business terms correctly in your answers.	6
Spencer wrote: A PLC has far more money than a private limited company. Because it is a larger organisation, it will be able to buy in bulk, and specialise. This should reduce costs. Examiner's note Spencer showed that he had a basic knowledge of limited companies, but he had given little detail and no reasons. This answer would probably get an 'E' grade. Carol wrote: A PLC has far more power to raise large amounts of capital, through selling its shares to the public. This means it can develop the business more easily than a private limited company.

This Revision Bite will help you understand the advantages and disadvantages of operating as a sole trader and a partnership. Barber's shops usually operate as sole traders A sole trader describes any business that is owned and controlled by one person, although they may employ workers, eg a newsagent's shop. Individuals who provide a specialist service like hairdressers, plumbers or photographers, are also sole traders. Sole traders do not have a separate legal existence from their owner. As a result, the owners are personally liable for the firm's debts, and may have to pay them out of their own pocket. This is called unlimited liability [Unlimited liability: Owners are personally liable for all debts. ].	6
Partnerships are businesses owned by two or more people. A contract called a deed of partnership is normally drawn up. This states the type of partnership it is, how much capital each party has contributed, and how profits and losses will be shared. Doctors, dentists and solicitors are typical examples of professionals who may go into partnership together. They can benefit from shared expertise, but like the sole trader, have unlimited liability. A partnership can also have a sleeping partner [Sleeping partner: Someone who invests capital into a business, but plays no part in the running of it. ] who invests in the business but does not have dealings in the day to day running of the enterprise.	6
Marie Bell is a recently qualified hairdresser and wants to open her own salon. She doesn't feel she knows enough about the business world to set up on her own. Her friend Simon Hartley is an experienced accountant, and has money that he would like to invest in a business venture. She is considering asking him to go into partnership with her. What would the advantages and disadvantages be for Marie? When you have finished take a look at the sample responses on the next page.	6

The state rather than shareholders own public corporations. The government establishes policy, and ensures they perform their functions properly. Much of the financing comes from the Treasury [Treasury: Government department responsible for finance. ], through taxation or grants. The government imposes tight controls. The relevant Government Minister can influence the choice of a corporation's Board and Chairperson. If serious problems arise, the Minister is questioned in Parliament, and is ultimately responsible. Parliamentary Select Committees and Consultative Committees are set up to monitor and investigate any irregularities or complaints about public corporations. Despite all this, corporations have a separate legal identity and their Board controls the every day running of the organisation.	6
Lisa wrote: The main reasons for privatising an industry are to increase efficiency and to reduce the cost. Nationalised industries are often uncompetitive, which means that if they make a loss, the cost has to be covered by the state. By privatising a nationalised industry, the government will no longer be responsible for financing it. Examiner's note Lisa's answer showed that she had a basic knowledge of nationalised industries. However, she hasn't given much detail, or supported her views very well. This answer would probably get an 'E' grade. Mike wrote: The main reasons for privatising an industry are to increase efficiency and to reduce the cost to the state.

Examiner's note Mike's answer showed that he understood the subject, and his explanations were good. He could have been more thorough and used business terms. This answer would probably get a 'C' grade. Natalie wrote: The main reasons for privatising an industry are to increase efficiency and to reduce the cost to the Treasury [Treasury: Government department responsible for finance. ] and the taxpayer. Nationalised industries can suffer from diseconomies of scale such as too much bureaucracy, a slow decision making process and poor labour relations. They also often have a monopoly, and so don't have to be competitive, which may mean staff are unmotivated. If these industries are inefficient, and make a loss, the cost has to be covered by the state, which means higher taxes for everyone. By privatising a nationalised industry, the government will no longer be responsible for financing it, and will hope that putting it back into a competitive market will improve efficiency. Examiner's note Natalie's answer was very good indeed, and showed that she understood the topic thoroughly. She was also able to use and apply the correct business terms, such as monopoly and diseconomies of scale. This answer would probably get an 'A' grade.	6
A firm may want to expand for a number of reasons. The main one is that it can benefit from economies of scale. A bigger firm will probably have a larger market share and a wider range of products than if it remains small. A large firm can borrow more cheaply. Its chances of survival are increased, as is its ability to make a profit. The larger it becomes, the more power and status it will have. This gives it a good negotiating position, if it wishes to expand still further. The most powerful companies may want to diversify [Diversify: Moving into another area of business. ] and take control of other companies. If they buy the majority of shares in another company (at least 51 % of them), this is called a takeover [Takeover: A company may buy 51% or more of another company's shares and then take it over. ], with the board of directors of the smaller firm unable to prevent it. If two companies agree to merge, it usually means a complete restructuring of the combined companies. This is called a merger [Merger: When two businesses join together to form one larger business. ]. The advantages of these forms of integration are that they can expand more quickly, and diversify into other areas of production. This increases the chances of growth, and reduces the risks. A firm's size can be measured in different ways: through its turnover [Turnover: Total revenue or income from sales ie all the money a business receives from selling goods or services. ], net profit [Net profit: Gross profit minus expenses (eg wages, rent, rates, advertising etc) leaves net profit. ], and number of employees.	6
The structure of business organisations depends on the nature of their activities. A manufacturing firm may have a different structure from one providing a service. A manufacturing firm may divide its operations up by product, as it probably produces a range of products. Most large companies have departments or functions as their basis for internal structure, for example: Production, Finance, Marketing and Personnel. The head of each area is called a director. The chain of command is the formal line of communication that starts with the Board of Directors and the Managing Director, who make the firm's decisions. Below them are the department managers, then the section heads and finally to the shop floor or office staff. This is a hierarchical [Hierarchical: The order or levels in a structure are based on each level being more important than the one below it. ] structure. The chain of command is a typical pyramid shape. At each stage in the chain, one person has a number of workers directly under them, within their span of control. This person directly responsible for a group of workers is called their line manager.	6
Production: Department in manufacturing firms responsible for turning raw materials into finished goods. Marketing: The function of this department includes consumer and market research, selling, advertising and distribution. Finance: This department deals with the accounting, recording, controlling and analysing of the firm's funds. Personnel: This department is responsible for employing and dismissing staff; salaries, assessment and training. Examiner's note The question makes it clear that you must describe the activities of a manufacturing company in your answer. The question asks you to write about four departments and you must write about all four to get full marks and give a general explanation of their function.	6
The Government has set up organisations that force businesses to take notice of the Consumer Protection Acts. If you buy a faulty product and the shop will not accept responsibility by giving you a replacement or your money back, you can go to your local Trading Standards Office. They will investigate and try to resolve the situation. Trading Standards have the power to prosecute traders who break consumer protection laws. The Director General of the Office of Fair Trading has an overall power to investigate business practices and ban them if they are against the consumer's interests. The idea for an Ombudsman came from Sweden and the name denotes a person who looks into public complaints in an industry. This organisation is not government run and aims to improve the standards of goods and services in the UK by carrying out tests on consumer products which are reported in their magazine 'Which? '. Business sector organisations which have been set up independently from the government. Both of these have voluntary codes of conduct [Voluntary codes: The set of rules and standards that a business in a trade association has to comply with. ] so are not covered by legislation [Legislation: The law. ]. ABTA was set up by travel agents to establish a code of conduct in dealing with customers. Any holidaymaker who books through an ABTA registered travel agent can be reassured that in the event of a bankruptcy other member agents would ensure their safe return home. The ASA deals with complaints about advertising in non-broadcast media. Advertisers have to ensure their advertisements meet the ASA's guidelines. All advertisements should be 'legal, decent, honest and truthful'.	6
Business forms part of a local community whose interests need to be considered. This Revision Bite looks at the development of superstores and their impact on local business. Goods in superstores are cheaper than small town centre shops as they can buy in bulk. This is what is known as economies of scaleeconomies of scale: Economy of scale means that big companies can produce things cheaper than smaller companies. There are two reasons for this. First, they can buy in bulk, so can negotiate with suppliers to pay less. Second, the more a company produces the lower the average cost per product will be of overheads (fixed costs, such as buildings). Where similar companies locate together as an industry they can also experience economies of scale. They share the costs of building the necessary infrastructure (eg roads, telecommunications) and the cost of educating the workforce, between them. Also the combined demand from all these companies should mean that supplies are cheaper., eg a pack of six tins of beans is cheaper than six individual ones. If one superstore orders a million tins of beans while another orders ten thousand, the superstore that orders the larger amount will buy the beans at a cheaper cost per tin. The saving is then passed on to the customers. If a superstore is built where other stores are located it will gain external economies of scale [External economies of scale: Costs are reduced when businesses are concentrated in one area eg Transport costs may be reduced. These may mean products can be made more cheaply. ]. Money will be saved because roads to reach the site and car parks have already been built.	6
A new 'out of town' superstore can face opposition from the local community. This could come from those who run small shops in the town, local residents or environmentalists. A pressure group may be formed to stop a superstore from being built. Pressure groups campaign by contacting their Member of Parliament/local councillors, writing letters to newspapers and magazines, holding public meetings, demonstrations and handing out leaflets to the public. This could also involve using direct action, such as occupying the field where the superstore is to be built. Businesses listen to pressure groups because they are afraid of bad publicity.	6
If people have valued skills which are in short supply, their pay or salary will be good and should rise throughout their working life. This is because there is a greater demand for these skills than can be supplied. The reverse is true for workers whose skills are not in demand. The Government takes about a third of most workers' pay, through income tax and National Insurance contributions. The basic rate of income tax is currently 20% for those earning a salary less than Â£34,800 a year. Tax cuts are popular, but remember tax pays for school, roads and many other public services. There are four main types of taxation [Taxation: The amount of money taken from people by the government to spend on public services. Income tax is taken off an employee's salary. This results in less money to spend in the shops. VAT is added to goods and services. The standard rate is 17.5%. A rise in VAT increases prices. This is a tax on company profits. A rise in this tax means companies keep less of their profits leading to less company investment and the possible loss of jobs. These are payments made by both the employee and the employer which pay for the cost of a state pension and the National Health Service. If this increases a company's costs will be higher and could result in redundancies.	6
Twenty years ago, the British pound was worth almost twice as much. For example, in 1989 a Mars Bar cost about 25p while today it costs around 45p. This rise in price is due to inflation [Inflation: A rise in general prices usually measured over a year. ]. An increase in pay that takes into account inflation is described as being 'in real terms'. For example, if pay increased by 5% last year but inflation was 2%, the pay increase would be: 5% - 2% = 3% 'in real terms'. You want to buy an MP3 player that costs Â£100. You can borrow Â£100 agreeing to pay 15% interest over the year. This means the total cost of the MP3 player will be Â£115. Another solution is to save for a year until you have the required amount. Taking inflation of 3% into account which is the better solution for you? If you borrow Â£100 at 15% you will have paid Â£115 for something which costs Â£100 at the time of purchase. With inflation at 3% the MP3 player would not normally cost Â£115 until 5 years later. If you had put Â£100 in the bank with a 10% interest rate you would have ended up with Â£110 after a year. Due to inflation of 3% the MP3 player will now cost Â£103 and you will have made a profit of Â£7 but at the expense of not having an MP3 player for a year. If it is possible to not use an MP3 player for a year then this would be the best solution. Exporters lose out from inflation. If prices rise faster in Britain than in other countries our goods will be too expensive for buyers abroad.	6
You would like your parents/guardians to buy you a new computer. Whether they can afford one depends on their employment status, savings, income and the amount of tax they have to pay. Give three reasons why they may not be able to buy a new computer. (3 marks) In the exam you would be expected to consider where the money would come from (do your parents/guardians work or are they facing redundancy? ), how much they are paid after tax and National Insurance and the value of their savings.	6
All businesses should keep proper accounts. This Revision Bite will help you to understand why accounting is important, an accountant's responsibilities and how it is carried out. The core aim of any business is to survive. After this, if it is in the private sector it will want to make a profit. If it is in the public sector it may want to improve or expand the services it provides. Either way, it will need to control its finances. By collecting all the available financial information and recording it in various accounts a business can assess how well it is performing. This is important both for a business internally as well as externally. Internally, managers want to know how much they are selling, the level of their costs and the amount of profit they are making. From this information they can set budgets and performance targets to plan for the next trading year. An accountant can show managers where financial problems might be occurring within their company. Externally, all businesses are legally required to keep records of their finances. A firm has to make its accounts available to HMRC [HMRC: Formed during 2005 following the merger of Inland Revenue and HM Customs and Excise Departments. ] (Her Majesty's Revenue & Customs). The larger the business, the stricter the rules on what accounts it has to prepare. Limited companies also have to publish an annual report and final accounts because they have a separate legal identity. These accounts have to be checked by an independent person - an auditor [Auditor: An independent person who checks the accounts. ] - to ensure that they give a 'true and fair view' of what has happened to the business during the previous year. Potential investors or shareholders, for example, will want to know if a business is worth investing in. Potential creditors will also want to know whether the company will be able to repay any loans or credit they give them. These assessments are based on two key accounting concepts: liquidity [Liquidity: A firm's ability to meet short-term debts. Assets of a firm which are cash or can be turned into cash very quickly are the most liquid. ] and profitability [profitability: A firm's income relative to expenditure. ]. Make sure you understand why accounting is important, what records are kept and what the law requires. This is a favourite topic with examiners.	6
An accountant has three main responsibilities. Once all the individual departments' financial records have been collected, the accountant can construct the company's accounts. This body of accounts is often known as a ledger and includes a sales ledger [Sales Ledger: Contains records of customer accounts. ], bought ledger [Bought ledger: Contains records about purchases. ] and cash book [Cash Book: Contains record of a firm's cash and bank accounts. ] amongst others. The accountant then analyses the information using various accounting ratios and formulae. The purpose of this is to identify any trends by comparing the results with previous results. Any trend, whether positive or negative, could affect the planning for the next year. Accountancy is a specialist area with its own technical language. As a result, the accountant will have to interpret his/her findings into a meaningful format. Other managers can then understand the information and will then be able to work together to plan and set budgets for the next year.	6

This Revision Bite will help you construct simple accounts and understand how they are used. At the end of every trading year a business prepares final accounts. These provide a financial summary of all their trading activity during the year. The trading account shows the gross profit [Gross profit: The difference between sales revenue and the cost price of these sales. ] (or loss) that the company has made. Profit is the money made by the business and equals income minus expenses. The profit and loss account shows the net profit [Net profit: Gross profit minus expenses (eg wages, rent, rates, advertising etc) leaves net profit. ] (or loss) made. The trading account and profit and loss account are often combined as one trading and profit and loss account so that both the gross and net profit can be displayed in the same set of accounts.	6
You may be given questions on the accounts of a company like Go Faster Sports, a high-street retail outlet. The first part of the accounts is the trading account. Turnover [Turnover: Total revenue or income from sales ie all the money a business receives from selling goods or services. ] shows the amount of revenue earned by the firm through the sale of goods at the marked up price [Marked up price: The price after the company has added its own profit margin on top of the cost of producing the goods. ]. Cost of sales shows how much they have spent on buying the goods at cost price before the firm has added its own profit margin. The opening stock and purchases are added together and then the closing stock is subtracted to give the cost of sales total of Â£100,000. This amount is then subtracted from the turnover of Â£200,000 to give a gross profit of Â£100,000. The account then continues with the profit and loss account. It shows the rest of the annual expenditure which is the normal cost of running a business, plus depreciation [Depreciation: Loss of value through wear and tear. ] and bad debts [Bad debts: Amount owed to a firm by a customer that won't be recovered. ]. These are deducted from the gross profit to give the true profit: the net profit [Net profit: Gross profit minus expenses (eg wages, rent, rates, advertising etc) leaves net profit. ]. Depreciation is an estimate of the loss in value of major assets [Assets: Everything a firm owns. ] like vehicles, furniture and machinery through wear and tear. This is useful to know for resale purposes. Bad debts represent the amount of money written off through goods sold on credit which will never be paid for.	6
This Revision Bite will help you understand why businesses need to budget and be aware of cash flow. A firm's managers need to be aware of the inflow and outflow of cash to plan future finances. The firm has various costs and different sources of income [Income: Money from sales, or revenue coming into the firm. ]. To keep the business profitable and avoid running into financial difficulties, accountants ensure the firm has enough working capital [Working capital: The difference between current assets less current liabilities - the difference between a firm's cash and its short-term debts - the money it has to play with. ] to pay any short-term debts when they fall due. The firm's accountants monitor and record the actual financial performance of the firm against the budget, so that its likely financial performance can be forecast. When the two are compared there will usually be a difference. Adjustments will be made for the next budget or forecast. Now look at both in detail and try to remember three ways of raising finance from each source.	6
A firm needs to know how much cash is coming in and going out. Drawing up a cash flow forecast [Cash flow forecast: Predicting the cash income and cash payments to be coming into and going out of a business at a given point in the future. ] shows whether there is enough cash available to pay salaries and settle debts on time. It calculates the firm's reserves [Reserves: Unused cash that a firm has available. ], which could be invested in expansion projects or new equipment. Accountants identify when shortfalls are likely to happen, and surplus funds are likely to become available. This helps them plan for when the firm might need an overdraft, or be able to reinvest its reserves into the business. You may get a question on a cash flow budget based on a case study. You will need to be able to calculate the cash balance as well as spot monthly trends.	6
The cash balances you have just calculated are only monthly results. To assess the cash available to the business, you have to add existing profits or deficits to the cash balance of the following month. This amount is the cash balance to carry forward, and in the next month's results is referred to as the cash balance brought forward. You will see that they are the same amount. For example, in January, the cash balance to carry forward was Â£2,150, the same figure as the cash balance brought forward for February. Similarly, you can tell that the cash balance to carry forward for the previous December was Â£1,650. This type of record helps managers to spot trends, and to plan the following months.	6
Using the cash flow budget for Go Faster Sports, answer the following questions. Which month produced the highest income from sales? Which month produced the best net cash surplus, and why? The total expenditure was considerably lower, because this was the only month that a significant amount wasn't spent on Equipment and Fittings. What is the amount of the cash balance brought forward for April? The same amount as the cash balance carried forward for March.	6
Now look at Go Faster Sports' Trading and Profit and Loss accounts. It gives information for the year ending 31 July. Try to work out the Return on Capital Employed before checking the answer. Remember that ROCE =net profit / capital employed Ã— 100 30.77% This represents a good investment. The amount being earned per pound (Â£0.31 rounded up) is much higher than most alternative investments would offer, like a building society savings account. Buying shares can be risky, as the value can fall as well as rise. A savings account earns an investor far less, but is safer. Either way, would-be investors will make a comparison with other investment opportunities. Calculate Go Faster Sports' gross profit margin. 50% Calculate Go Faster Sports' net profit margin. 10% Remember that the results in themselves, however, mean little, unless they are compared with previous company results or those of their competitors.	6
Another measure of a company's liquidity is the acid test/liquid assets ratio [Acid test/liquid assets ratio: The ability to meet short-term debts without selling stock. ]. This deducts the value of currently held stock to find the company's ability to meet its liabilities immediately. Stock is the least liquid current asset so it is deducted to give a more realistic view of the company's liquidity. Learn this equation. You may be asked to calculate the acid test ratio in an exam. Acid test / liquid assets = current assets - closing stock / current liabilities Now look at Go Faster Sport's balance sheet and calculate the acid test / liquid assets ratio. This shows us that Go Faster can afford to pay their short-term debts three times over immediately without selling any stock.	6
The Public Sector operates both at national level and locally. Responsibility, and therefore funding, lies with central government or local authorities. Although the main function of public corporations and local authority undertakings is to provide a service for everyone, they may also make a profit. If this is the case, then the surplus cash is reinvested in the business as retained profits, to develop or improve the service. Otherwise, funding comes from the Treasury or the local authority, either in the form of grants funded by taxation, or loans. The Public Sector Net Cash Requirement (PSNCR) is the money required by the public sector of the economy for expenditure on items that are not financed by income.	6
Exam questions in this subject are often based on case studies. Read the following case study and think of how you would answer the question. Top Sounds is a dance club that wants to keep up to date by installing video monitors throughout the premises. They are not sure which monitors they should buy because technology is advancing so quickly. At the moment, they only have one projector and a large projection screen. Both are old-fashioned. Business has been quiet lately so they don't have much working capital. Give one possible internal source of finance and one possible external source of finance that Top Sounds could use, explaining your reasons. When you have finished take a look at the sample answers on the next page. Remember you will gain extra marks if you show you can use business terms correctly in your answers.	6
Conrad wrote: One internal source of finance that Top Sounds is to sell the projector and screen. As an external source of finance they could lease the video monitors. Examiner's note Conrad's answer was very basic. He has made good decisions but has given no reasons. This answer would probably get an 'E' grade. Nona wrote: Top Sounds have to make sure they do not use up all their working capital. One internal source of finance that they could use is to sell some assets. The projector and screen are going to be replaced by the video monitors, so could be sold. As they don't have much cash they may also need external financing to get the video monitors. Leasing [Leasing: Renting equipment through financing. ] them would be a cheaper option at the moment than buying them for cash. Examiner's note Nona's answer showed she understood the subject and her explanations were good. She could have given more detail and used business terms. This answer would probably get a 'C' grade. Pete wrote: Top Sounds have to make sure they have liquidity by not using up all their working capital. One internal source of finance that they could use is to sell some assets. The projector and screen are old-fashioned and are going to be replaced by the video monitors so will not be needed anymore and could be sold. One external source of finance they could use is leasing the video monitors. This would be a cheaper short-term option than buying them for cash and safer as they are not sure which monitors they should get. It would be easier to change them if they were not happy with them and to update them when new models come along.Another alternative might be to use hire purchase [Hire purchase: Buying equipment through financing. ] which would mean initially smaller expenditure but in the long term will cost more than the original price. Examiner's note Pete's answer was very detailed, and gave good explanations. He showed that he understood the subject very well and used the correct business terms like working capital and assets. This answer would probably get an 'A' grade.	6
This Revision Bite will help you to use simple calculations to assess how a business is performing. The aim of businesses in the private sector is to make a profit. A firm produces accounts to calculate its assets and liabilities. The purposes of the Trading account and the Profit and Loss account are to calculate and show the gross profit [Gross profit: The difference between sales revenue and the cost price of these sales. ] and net profit [Net profit: Gross profit minus expenses (eg wages, rent, rates, advertising etc) leaves net profit. ]. You may be expected to answer questions in the exam about information given in a Trading and Profit and Loss account, like Go Faster Sports below. You may have to provide information about the average stock [Average stock: The value of stock held on average. ] held by the firm, or show the examiner an indication of how well trading is going, by calculating the rate of stock turnover [Rate of stock turnover: How often the average stock is sold. ]. A company's published accounts provide investors with indicators about the business' profitability and managers with information about its efficiency. This will influence their future decisions.	6
An indication of how well trading is going is to calculate the rate of stock turnover. This shows us how quickly or slowly a business is selling its stock. First of all, you have to find the average stock held. Look at the firm's Trading and Profit and Loss Account for the year ending 31 July and calculate the average stock held by Go Faster Sports. This shows that Go Faster sell their average stock ten times a year. If the rate of stock turnover was very low, it could indicate that they were holding too much stock on average, or that trading was very slow.	6

This Revision Bite will help you understand why branding and packaging is an important part of marketing. The basic function of packaging has always been to protect and contain a product. In a competitive market, branding and packaging are important and have become an integral part of the product. We instantly recognise products by the size, shape and colour of packaging. The marketing department give a product a unique look and decide on the package design. This will incorporate the brand name [Brand name: Name of a product or service. ] and will differentiate the product from competitors.This is known as a unique selling point [Unique selling point: The unique thing about the product that makes consumers buy it. This can be branding, packaging or a feature of the product. ]. The shape, size and colour are important factors when packaging a product. The marketing department will want to make the packaging attractive and distinctive. Coke's packaging is dominated by red. This helps consumers to recognise a product instantly, when they are in a shop. The same applies to the shape of the packaging. Deodorants and shampoos, for example, come in all shapes and sizes. Remember that the actual product is inside the container, so the packaging and advertising are all that will attract us to try a product in the first place. Large manufacturers understand the importance of their brand name. Kellogg's, Adidas and Microsoft are all household names which we associate with quality. As a result, we are likely to buy one of their products when we go shopping rather than an untried or unknown one even if it is say, a supermarket's own brand [Own brand: A company, say a supermarket, produces its own brand of a well known product eg Cola. ]. This is why it is important for their brand name or a striking logologo: a basic computer programming language used to program the direction of a turtle (small robot) to be prominent on packaging. The main aim of product differentiation [Product differentiation: Giving the product a unique selling point. ] is to give a product a distinctive image which will differentiate it from similar products. An expensive perfume or aftershave might be sold in an elegantly designed bottle. This sort of packaging suggests quality and would be targeted at a person with taste. Even if the product itself was not very good, the packaging alone could give the impression that it was.	6
The success of a product through branding can lead to brand loyalty [Brand loyalty: Choosing and continuing to buy your favourite brand. ]. A positive buying experience results in repeat sales. Consumers tend to stick to a product if we like it. This in turn can lead to a trust in other products under the same brand name. There are so many products on the market, many of them similar to each other, that the decision to make a first time purchase can be a difficult process. If we don't know about the product already, we take advice from people who do or we read the magazine reports about it. Without personal recommendation, we rely on advertising and the product's packaging to help us make a buying decision. In a highly competitive market, the marketing department try to make their products stand out against the rest. A supermarket is a good example of this, with shelves full of almost identical products to choose from. The challenge facing the package designer is how to grab our attention so we make an impulse buy [Impulse buy: A spontaneous decision to buy. ].	6
Surj wrote: Fizz should make sure their name is clearly shown on the packaging. Anyone who has tried their products before and liked them would be likely to buy this new one. As they want to sell to schoolchildren it would be a good idea to use bright colours on the packaging. Examiner's note Surj's answer shows that he only understands the basics of packaging. There is very little detail, and he has also only given one reason. This answer would probably get an 'E' grade. Saf wrote: Fizz should make sure their name is clearly shown on the packaging to make sure their product stands out.

Examiner's note Saf's answer shows that she understands packaging quite well as she gives good reasons. She could, however, have been a little more detailed and used business terms. This answer would probably get a 'C' grade. Marlon's answer: Fizz should make sure their brand name and logo are clearly shown on the packaging to help the consumer recognise their brand and to differentiate the product. This would allow Fizz to take advantage of brand loyalty. Anyone who has tried their products before and liked them would be likely to buy this new one as opposed to another similar product. As their target market is schoolchildren it could also be a good idea to use bright colours on their packaging and perhaps even a cartoon character, as these have been very successful ways of attracting children in the past. Examiner's note Marlon's answer is very thorough. He gives good reasons for his suggestions and uses the correct business terms, like 'brand loyalty' and 'differentiate the product'. This answer would probably get an 'A' grade.	6

Anyone who has tried their products before and liked them would be likely to buy this new one. As they want to sell to schoolchildren it would be a good idea to use bright colours on the packaging. Examiner's note Surj's answer shows that he only understands the basics of packaging. There is very little detail, and he has also only given one reason. This answer would probably get an 'E' grade. Saf wrote: Fizz should make sure their name is clearly shown on the packaging to make sure their product stands out. Anyone who has tried their products before and liked them would be likely to buy this new one as opposed to another similar product. As they want to sell to schoolchildren it could also be a good idea to use bright colours on their packaging as this has been a very successful way of attracting children in the past. Examiner's note Saf's answer shows that she understands packaging quite well as she gives good reasons. She could, however, have been a little more detailed and used business terms. This answer would probably get a 'C' grade. Marlon's answer: Fizz should make sure their brand name and logo are clearly shown on the packaging to help the consumer recognise their brand and to differentiate the product. This would allow Fizz to take advantage of brand loyalty. Anyone who has tried their products before and liked them would be likely to buy this new one as opposed to another similar product. As their target market is schoolchildren it could also be a good idea to use bright colours on their packaging and perhaps even a cartoon character, as these have been very successful ways of attracting children in the past. Examiner's note Marlon's answer is very thorough. He gives good reasons for his suggestions and uses the correct business terms, like 'brand loyalty' and 'differentiate the product'. This answer would probably get an 'A' grade.	6
This Revision Bite will help you understand how a company can meet their consumers' needs effectively. The 4Ps are the ideas to consider when marketing a product. They form the basis of the marketing mix. Getting this mix right is critical in order to successfully market a product. If market research is carried out effectively, a company can plan a promotion for the right product, at the right price, and to get it to their chosen market, in the right place. Now look at the 4Ps in more detail. A product can be either a good or a service [Goods or services: Goods are usually products that you can see whilst services are those things which are done for the consumer like retailing, hairdressing and cleaning. ] that is sold either to a commercial customer [Commercial customer: A business which is itself a consumer. ] or an end consumer [End consumer: The final consumer of a good or a service. ]. A customer buys a product, and a consumer uses it. Sometimes these are one and the same, as an industrial firm can also be a customer and a consumer. For example, British Airways might buy aeroplanes from British Aerospace, so it is a customer. It won't sell on the planes to another buyer, as BA needs the planes to provide its service, so it is also a consumer. Sometimes a wide product range [Product range: The range of goods that a firm produces. ] covers both (Mercedes produce lorries for haulage companies, and cars for domestic use). More commonly, there will be a number of sellers forming a chain of distribution [Chain of distribution: The route a product takes from the primary sector through the secondary sector to the tertiary sector and the consumer. ]. For example, a gold mine may sell gold to a jewellery manufacturer, who in turn will sell on rings to wholesalers and retailers, before we get to buy them in the high street. Each is a customer, but only the final user is the end consumer. A marketing manager will identify who his/her target market [target market: the end-user or consumer group to whom the manufacturer aims to sell ] is, what they want, and sell it to them at each stage in the chain. No matter how good the product is, it is unlikely to succeed unless the price is right. This does not just mean being cheaper than competitors. Most people associate a higher price with quality, so you would expect to pay more for a Rolls Royce than for a Lada. On the other hand, is one cola worth more than another, and if so, how much? As a rule, a producer of luxury or medical products will use skim pricing or premium pricing [Skim pricing or premium pricing: A high price is set to maximise profit. ] initially, in order to maximize its profits. This is useful, as it helps them to recover expensive research and development costs quickly. For fast moving consumable goods (fmcg's) like colas, penetration pricing [Penetration pricing: A low price is set to improve its market share. ] is usually used. The firm will want a large share of the market, so will settle for a small profit on each item. In the long term, they hope that the turnover, and therefore their profits, will be high. The simplest method of all is cost plus pricing [Cost-plus pricing: A method of pricing where each product's unit price has a mark-up added, say 5% of the purchase price or the manufacturing cost and this then becomes the selling price. ], where a firm adds a profit mark-up [Mark-up: The profit added to the cost by resellers. ] to the unit cost. The main aims of promotion are to persuade, inform and make people more aware of a brand, as well as improving sales figures. Advertising is the most widely used form of promotion, and can be through the media of TV, radio, journals, cinema or outdoors (billboards, posters). The specific sections of society (market segments) being targeted will affect the types of media chosen, as will the cost. If you were a toy manufacturer, you might want an advertising spot during children's TV. If you ran a local restaurant, you might choose a local paper or radio. A small or local business would not usually advertise on TV, because it is very expensive. Sales promotion is designed to encourage new and repeat sales [Repeat sales/business: Customers returning to buy from the same business. ]. Loyalty cards, free gifts, competitions and voucher schemes are the most popular. Companies use sponsorship and public relations to improve their image, notably through financing sports, the arts and public information services. Distribution channels are the key to this area. A firm has to find the most cost-effective way to get the product to the consumer. Direct marketing [Direct marketing: Where sellers contact potential buyers directly without having middlemen buying their goods and then selling them on to consumers. ] through catalogues, via a TV shopping channel and through the Internet have become popular, because the consumer can shop from home. For the firm, they can cut out the middleman in the process, and can therefore make more profit. Going through wholesalers and high-street retailers, however, is the most popular form of distribution, as that is still where most people shop. The most important thing about marketing is to identify what the consumers' needs are, and then try to meet them. This is called consumer-orientation. To find out what these needs are, a firm's marketing department or a specialist research organisation carry out extensive market research.	6
Teresa wrote: I would advertise in the local newspaper, and on the radio. It would be cheap, and most of the consumers would be local. I would also use sales promotion. Examiner's note Teresa has the right idea, but the question asks for two examples, and requires two reasons. She has given two examples but only given one set of reasons and this will lose her marks. She also needs to give far more explanation, eg why she would use a sales promotion. Exam questions are usually based on case studies. The examiner will want to see that you understand the principles of marketing, and can apply them to a real-life situation. Gary wrote: I would advertise in the local newspaper, as it is cheaper than other forms of advertising, and most of the market would live locally. I would also use a discount voucher scheme as sales promotion to increase the sales of our boot and other products. Examiner's note Gary has answered the question quite well, and given good reasons. He would get a much better grade, however, if he gave more detail, and used business terms (see Gillian's answer). Exam questions are usually based on case studies.

I would also use a discount voucher scheme as a form of sales promotion. It would give a 10% discount to our customers on any future purchases of our products. This should lead to increased sales of the rest of our product range, as well as making our boot more attractive to consumers in terms of value for money. Examiner's note Gillian's answer would probably get an A grade.

From this, it will identify who its market is, and then put together a marketing plan based on the findings. The marketing mix will be central to this, and finding the right balance in each of the 4Ps is very important. The firm can then review and adapt their plan when they need to. Kendal Footwear is a small manufacturing company situated near the Lake District in Cumbria. They are launching a new, good quality walking boot to add to their product range. As their marketing manager, what two promotional activities might you use? Explain your reasons. When you have finished take a look at the sample answers on the next page.

Marketing departments need to have information so they can get their marketing mix [Marketing mix: The mix of the 4Ps (product, price, place, promotion). ] right. For example, they will want to know what similar products already exist and how much they cost. They will also want to know whether consumers will want to buy their new product, and what they think about it. Now have a look at the process in more detail. Make sure you know what you are trying to find out, and how it will help you. This is something that people sometimes forget. There is an endless amount of information available, so it is important to be focused. You have to decide which are going to be the best ways to gather this information. Choose the most appropriate reports and journals. Depending on how much time you have, choose what field research you can do. Designing questionnaires and testing products on consumers can take a long time. You also have to decide whether you have the necessary skills, or whether you need to use a specialist research organisation. This is a more expensive option. You would usually do desk research first, because it is cheaper and quicker. Then supplement this with field research, so that you don't duplicate your findings. Designing the questionnaires and conducting the surveys takes place during this phase. Now that you have the findings, you have to work out what they are telling you. If you identified your objectives before you started, this should not be too difficult. You must look for trends [trends: Shared views or patterns of behaviour. ] and patterns. Then you should see how this affects your marketing mix. For example, if you were thinking of setting a price for your product of Â£10 per unit, and 70% of the sample group [sample group: The group of people being questioned by primary or field research. ] think this is too high, then you may need to consider reducing the price. If you don't, you may find that few consumers will buy it. But remember: no survey is perfect. There is always a margin of error.	6
Dionne wrote: Desk research is finding information that already exists, and field research is finding new information. Journals are one type of desk research, and questionnaires are one type of field research. Examiner's note Dionne's answer was basically correct, but lacked detail. It also looks as if she didn't read the question properly as she only gave one example of each type of research. If the question asks for two reasons then you will have to give two to get full marks. Garth wrote: Desk research is finding information from sources that already exist, such as journals and reports. Field research is finding out new information that you specifically need. This could be through questionnaires or consumers trying out your product. Examiner's note Garth's answer showed he understood the terms, and his examples were appropriate. He could have included more detail, and would have gained more marks by using business terms in his answer (see Heather's answer). Heather wrote: Desk research is getting data from existing secondary sources, such as journals and reports. Field research is finding out new information about your consumer's needs. This could be through a survey using questionnaires, or getting them to try out your products and recording their opinions. Examiner's note Heather's answer was very detailed, and she used the correct business terms. She showed that she understood the subject very well. She would get a very good mark.	6
Marketing departments use segmentation so they can target their products more accurately. If the product is effectively segmented a company will be able to promote the right product, at the right price and use the right distribution to reach the place where the consumers are. Now look at the way the 4Ps are used in market segmentation. Firms have a range of products that will be targeted at different groups or segments. For example, a car manufacturer will often have a range that includes a family model, an executive [Executive: High-level businessman or woman. ] model and a sports model. Lifestyle segmentation will be used to develop their product line and to target their products. Price and quality are obviously linked but not everyone can afford to buy the most expensive goods. There is a large range of televisions on the market, for example, each with slightly different features. Within this range of products, there will also be a range of prices to cater for varying disposable incomes. Studying how a product is advertised can reveal its target market [target market: the end-user or consumer group to whom the manufacturer aims to sell ]. A mobile phone company recently used advertising campaigns that varied for men and women. The male phone was pictured in black and white, and all its features and business applications described. The female phone was in bright colours, and was pictured as a matching accessory to go with a woman's lipstick and handbag. You may not agree with this stereotyping, but it is a good example of gender segmentation. A firm needs to know where its target market is. For example, a producer of Kosher food needs to identify areas where Jewish people live. The firm would have to consider how best to get its product to these areas. This is an example of cultural segmentation.	6
Exam questions are usually based on case studies. Look carefully at your case study to see if there is any information on market segmentation. The examiner will want to see that you understand the principles of market segmentation. Mandy wrote: Planet Airlines would want to sell their First Class seats to rich people. Business Class would probably be sold to business people and Economy Class to poorer people. Examiner's note Mandy's answer was very basic. She has shown some understanding of the subject, but should have given far more detailed reasons. This answer would probably get an 'E' grade. Jamie wrote: Planet Airlines would want to sell their First Class seats to rich people, because they can afford to spend more money. Business Class would probably be sold to business people, because they need more space to work on the plane. Economy Class would probably be aimed at people who cannot afford expensive tickets, for example, a family. Examiner's note Jamie's answer showed he understood the subject, and his explanations were good. He could have included more detail and used business terms. This answer would probably get a 'C' grade. Craig wrote: Planet Airlines would want to sell their First Class seats to people in the highest socio-economic groups. Many of these will be in high managerial jobs with a large disposable income, and can afford to spend more money on luxuries. Business Class would probably be targeted at business people, because they need space to work on the plane, as well as being fresh for meetings on arrival. Economy Class would probably be aimed at tourists and people who cannot afford expensive seats, for example, an average family, belonging to soci-economic groups C1 or C2, white collar (office) and blue collar (factory) workers. These are examples of income and lifestyle segmentation. Examiner's note Craig's answer was very detailed, and he used the correct business terms like 'disposable income' and 'lifestyle segmentation'. He showed that he understood the subject very well indeed. This answer would probably get an 'A' grade.	6
All products have a limited life both for the consumer and the producer. This Revision Bite will help you understand what the product life-cycle is and why it is important in marketing. When we buy a product we need to know how long it will last. Perishable goods, like fruit and vegetables, have a short lifespan. Durables like a car have a longer lifespan. The product life-cycle The product is tested and developed before it is launched. Initial sales will be low until the consumer starts buying. At this point, production costs are much higher than the revenue from sales. As sales increase production becomes more profitable. The early development costs can be recovered. The success of the product can lead to brand loyalty [Brand loyalty: Choosing and continuing to buy your favourite brand. ] and repeat sales [Repeat sales/business: Customers returning to buy from the same business. ]. The product reaches its peak of sale and is at its most profitable point for the company. Competitors have now entered the market which may reach saturation point [Saturation point: When the market is full of similar products it becomes difficult for a product to make additional profits. ]. As new models and designs come out, or fashions change, a product may become obsolete [Obsolete: A product that is outdated or one which has been replaced by another. ]. Sales fall, as does revenue. It is no longer profitable to produce it.	6
Marketing teams watch for changes in the business environment and react to them. They respond to consumer needs, the actions of competitors or government and use the following strategies during each stage of the product life cycle. To make the target market aware of the new product it is important to heavily promote [promote: use advertising and publicity to increase the sales of a product ] it. A special introductory price [Introductory price: This is usually a one-off price which is used as a promotionary tactic to gain customers attention and so to increase sales. Later the price will rise. ] may help push the product. As sales and profitability increase, the selling price may be reduced to make the product more attractive. Continued advertising around the brand name will help to sustain sales. The marketing team may consider expanding its distribution, to reach more consumers. Competitors will usually have entered the market at this stage. If their products are as good but cheaper the company may lose some of its market share. The pricing strategy must be reviewed. Marketers may also put added value [Added value: Extras making a product more attractive. ] onto their product, by offering accessories or insurance, for example. Marketing cannot save a product at this stage, but targeting a different and smaller segment can prolong its life.	6
Hard PC, a computer engineering company, has developed a new processor that is ten times more powerful than existing ones. Their product has sold very well, but is now passing from its growth stage into its maturity stage. Competitors have already entered the market. As a member of their marketing team, suggest two promotional activities Hard PC might use. Give your reasons. When you have finished take a look at the sample answers on the next page.	6
Most exam questions in this subject are based on a case study that provides a setting for business theory. Look carefully at your case study to see what information is given about the product life-cycle. Think about the different stages and the marketing strategies that can be used. Jill wrote: We need to promote our product. I would suggest that we offer free accessories to increase sales. We could also try advertising our new promotion. Examiner's note Jill's answer shows the right kind of promotional activities for this situation but not the reasons for them. This kind of promotion would not necessarily be used to 'increase sales'. She has also only given one reason. This answer would probably get an 'E' grade. Luke wrote: There is a lot of competition so we need to promote our product.

A report is a formal document from somebody who has carried out an investigation. It should be written in a formal style and should always finish by recommending a course of action. Terms of reference is a statement of exactly what is being investigated and who the report is being prepared for. The Procedure section describes what has been done or how information has been obtained. The findings gives the details of what has been found out.Using the wine bar example there may be a list of things which need to be done.These would be costed out and the most suitable source of funding then listed alongside. The conclusion is a general statement of what has been found out. The recomendation section would contain the best course of action. There will be a signature block at the bottom to say who drew up the report.	6
This Revision Bite is about how people communicate with each other in a business setting. It will help you understand why communication is such an important issue and examines various methods of getting a message across in different situations. Communicating means passing on information, or receiving it from somebody else. Imagine the problems that could occur if this is not done carefully. Some methods of passing on information involve writing it down. Other methods use the spoken word (sometimes known as oral methods). Read through this example of a memo written about a change of venue for a meeting.

Dear Mr Bullock, E: ORDER 6673-4 FOR 12 BRASS DOORKNOBS Yours sincerely, Always read through your letters when you have finished to check for mistakes in grammar or spelling. Be careful if you use a spellchecker on your computer as it cannot always tell which version of a word is appropriate in the context you have chosen, eg their and there. Add any unfamiliar names to the spellchecker's dictionary. A report is a formal document from somebody who has carried out an investigation. It should be written in a formal style and should always finish by recommending a course of action. Terms of reference is a statement of exactly what is being investigated and who the report is being prepared for. The Procedure section describes what has been done or how information has been obtained. The findings gives the details of what has been found out.Using the wine bar example there may be a list of things which need to be done.These would be costed out and the most suitable source of funding then listed alongside. The conclusion is a general statement of what has been found out. The recomendation section would contain the best course of action. There will be a signature block at the bottom to say who drew up the report.	6
In recent years modern information and communication technology has changed the way people go about their business. Developments in information and communication technology (ICT) have changed the way people work. Today's employees have much more information at their fingertips and can communicate information quickly and effectively. The use of computers to process information has meant many jobs have been lost in industries such as banking, where there used to be a need for a large number of clerical staff. In manufacturing there has also been a change in the way things are done. Many routine jobs can now be done by robots, eg paint spraying new car bodies. Changes in ICT can often lead to increased productivity. This means businesses can be competitive. Some employees can now work away from the office. This is called teleworking. A teleworker is able to work at home and is connected to work via a computer and modem. This can make the job more flexible, which is an advantage for some parents who have to combine paid employment with childcare responsibilities.	6
"Your body can betray what your feelings are at an interview. Different candidates will give different impressions to the interview panel by the way they behave in an interview. A person who sits with their arms and legs crossed and their head down.

Money, and the way it is paid, can affect motivation to work. In your exam, you may be asked to calculate wages and bonuses or to compare one type of payment scheme to another. Paying extra money for jobs with difficult hours will usually encourage people to apply for the work. A loyalty bonus can be used to persuade workers to stay with their employer for a long period of time. Employees may not want to work longer than their contracted hours but they can often be persuaded to do so by receiving a higher rate of pay. A perk is a payment in kind. It is often cheaper for the employer to provide goods rather than the money to buy them with. A good perk will make an employee reluctant to leave the business.	6
In your exam, you may be asked to calculate wages and bonuses or to compare one type of payment scheme to another. Charlotte works as a care assistant at a privately run care home for the elderly. Here are details of her pay and perks. What is her basic pay per week? She earns Â£140 basic pay. How much does she earn in total in a typical week? She earns Â£175.75. How much overtime does she do in an average week? She works 3 hours overtime. What does she earn annually? She earns Â£9,499 in a typical year.	6
This Revision Bite will help you understand why vacancies arise and the role the Human Resources department plays in recruitment. It explains the process of recruitment from the vacancy occurring to the appointment of a new member of staff. The Human Resources department [Human Resources department: Sometimes referred to as HR or the Personnel department - responsible for recruitment and training. ] is usually responsible for recruiting new staff and for training them to do their job. When job vacancies arise, it draws up documents for specific purposes, organises and runs interviews. The Human Resources department has to follow certain procedures before a job can be advertised. This page will explain these different stages in detail.	6
Above the breakeven [Breakeven: Where no profit or loss is made ie where total revenue = total costs. ] point is when a firm begins to make a profit. It will make a loss if it produces and sells output below this level. The breakeven point for a firm is when total costs equals total revenue. Expenditure and income are the same and the firm makes neither a profit or a loss. If the firm can sell at production levels above this point, it will be making a profit. If sales fall below this point, it will be making a loss. Establishing the breakeven point helps a firm to plan the levels of production it needs to be profitable. Before you can calculate the breakeven point, you need to identify the firm's costs. Renting an office block is part of a company's fixed costs Fixed costs [Fixed costs: These do not change as output changes, eg rent. ] are constant and do not change however many goods are produced. They include rent and insurance. Wages paid to employees are part of a company's variable costs The firm's variable costs [Variable costs: These change according to output eg raw materials. ] include raw materials and wages. You need to calculate the variable costs per unit. These costs increase in direct proportion to the number of units produced. By adding the firm's variable costs and fixed costs you can work out the total costs [Total costs: Fixed costs plus variable costs make total costs. ]. The firm's variable costs are added to the fixed costs and these make the total costs. You need to establish how many units are to be produced. You need to know the selling price of the units. Once you have the above information, you can begin to calculate the breakeven point. You do this either by using a chart or an equation. Breakeven analysis uses fixed costs [Fixed costs: These do not change as output changes, eg rent. ] and variable costs [Variable costs: These change according to output eg raw materials. ] to calculate the breakeven point. You may find it helpful to work through the production costs Revision Bite before starting this one.	6
This Revision Bite will help you understand why a company must have a good location and be able to distribute its products effectively. When choosing a good location for a business, there are six important points to consider. An area that is rich in raw materials attracts industry. For instance, the steel industry was located in Yorkshire due to the rich sources of coal with which to smelt the nearby iron. Canals were the quickest way of moving bulky material around until railways were built. Now a network of motorways makes it easy to transport goods. Some industries still need to be close to transport links, so produce can be moved to market quickly and cheaply, eg newspaper printers and distributors. It used to be a problem to find enough people to make up the workforce but with high levels of unemployment this is no longer an issue. However, workers with specialist skills are often needed. Many engineering and technology firms locate near universities, where people with the right skills are often available. Getting produce to market is no longer a problem because of the extensive transport and communications links in the UK. It can be an advantage being located near a densely populated market like Greater London, but the land costs are usually higher. Supermarkets and restaurants locate near their markets, or customers. In some areas, a whole industry has developed, like the car industry in the West Midlands. This concentration means that firms there can share expertise and training. They may even work on new research together. This can lead to shared economies of scale, such as cheaper prices for components through reduced delivery costs. Central government sometimes offers incentives to any firms who are prepared to move to a targeted area. These might be areas of high unemployment or where the local economy needs stimulating. New towns like Telford and Milton Keynes and economic development areas [Economic development areas: Regions to which government is trying to attract firms, often by offering incentives. ] or enterprise zones [Enterprise zones: Financial incentives are offered to firms setting up in designated locations. ] like London's Docklands have grown up in this way. Firms need easy access to their source of raw materials and good transport links to the marketplace. They require a workforce with the right skills and want to benefit from external economies of scale [External economies of scale: Costs are reduced when businesses are concentrated in one area eg Transport costs may be reduced. These may mean products can be made more cheaply. ]. Footloose industries can locate anywhere in the world and are not limited by any of these location factors. Examples include IT companies and call centres which both use telephone lines to transmit information The most important thing about location is to deliver the product as quickly and as cheaply as possible to the consumer. This maximises profit.	6
Explain the purpose of economic development areas. Phil wrote: Where there is an area of high unemployment, the government sometimes creates an economic development area. They do this to attract new industry to the area. Examiner's note Phil's answer shows that he knows what an economic development area is, but not much more. He also hasn't really given any reasons. This answer would probably get an 'E' grade. Mandy wrote: Where there is an area of high unemployment, or local industry is depressed, the government sometimes creates an economic development area. They do this by offering financial incentives, to attract new industry to the area, and create new jobs. Examiner's note Mandy has answered the question quite well and given good explanations. She has shown that she understands the topic, but could have given more detail. This answer would probably get a 'C' grade. Farzan wrote: Where there is an area of high unemployment or local industry is depressed, the government sometimes creates an economic development area or enterprise zone. They do this by offering financial incentives such as low cost or free site rental and tax discounts. The reason for this is to attract new industry to the area and to stimulate the local economy, which should create new jobs and generate more wealth. Examiner's note	6
This Revision Bite will help you understand the main methods of production and the impact of new technology. The types of goods and size of potential orders will affect the method of production used. This method is used when a customer makes an order for something to be made to his or her own specifications, for example a made-to-measure wedding dress, a personally designed house, a motorway or a passenger cruiser. This method is used when the size of the market for a product is not clear, and where there is a range within a product line [Product line: A product's range of sizes, designs or models. ]. A certain number of the same goods will be produced to make a up a batch or run, for example clothes (where a batch of size 12 clothes in blue might be made, then a batch of size 10 in red), or carpets. This method involves using estimates. Large-scale production benefits from economies of scale, such as division of labour and specialisation. This method is used when there is a mass market for a large number of identical products, for example, cars, computers, chocolate bars or toasters. The product passes from one stage of production to another along a production line [Production line: A stage by stage manufacturing process. ].	6
Production methods are constantly evolving in the attempt to cut costs and raise profits. Automation [Automation: Computer controlled machines or robots highly involved in production - replacing workers but also require highly skilled staff to set-up and maintain them. ] has been used for many years in production to perform specific tasks in mass production. The draw back with this method is that computer-controlled machinery replaces workers leading to large-scale redundancies. This has happened in the motor industry. This sort of machinery is very expensive, so a company will be taking a risk as a product may not be successful. On the other hand, production levels and quality improve, which leads to less wastage and therefore lower costs. CAD allows designers, engineers and architects to manipulate a 3D image. An image can be altered on-screen so the effects of any changes are seen instantly. This represents a huge saving in time and costs as a prototype need not be built at each stage. Customers can even design their own products and email them to the business. The products can then go straight into production. The most important application of CAM in production is the use of robots. These can be programmed to copy the physical movements of workers. They are particularly useful for repetitive tasks, or for those dangerous to health, for example, working with poisonous gases or radioactivity. The advantage of robots over humans is that they don't get tired or ill but they do need to be maintained.	6

The purchasing department of a firm handles stock control. Large companies are able to benefit from economies of scale and bulk buying at a discounted price. However, this can lead to a number of problems like increased storage costs and a greater risk of theft or deterioration. If stock levels are kept low, there is the risk of running out of stock. Production may have to be slowed down or even stopped. Wages and machinery must still be paid for, whether the firm is producing anything or not. For smaller firms, cash flow [Cash flow: Having capital available to use. ] can be a problem. If too much capital [Capital: Money (or assets). ] is tied up in stock the financial flexibility of their operations can be affected. To achieve a correct balance in stock levels firms set maximum and minimum stock levels. The Economic Order Quantity (EOQ) is the size of a reorder, and is calculated by comparing the relative costs of storage with the savings from bulk-buying discounts.	6
Kylie wrote: The production department is responsible for the actual manufacture of goods. This means that it has to plan how long the process will take, and when stock will need to be reordered. This is necessary to ensure that production is not slowed down. Examiner's note Kylie's answer shows that she understands some of the basics of what production planning is but she has not 'explained' the reasons in enough detail. This answer would probably get an 'E' grade. Jerry wrote: The production department is responsible for the actual manufacture of goods. This means that it has to plan when manufacturing can start, how long the process will take, and when stock will need to be reordered. This is necessary to ensure that production is not slowed down or halted, because stock hasn't been ordered in time. Machines and workers may not be able to produce anything, but they would still have to be paid for, which would cause the firm unnecessary costs. Examiner's note Jerry has answered the question well and given good explanations. He has shown that he understands the topic. However, more detail and the use of business terms would have given him a higher grade. This answer would probably get a 'C' grade. Lynne wrote: The production department is responsible for the actual manufacture of goods. This means that the engineering and technical function has to be co-ordinated with stock control. In order to do this efficiently, the production department has to decide when manufacturing can start, how long process will take, and when components or raw materials will need to be reordered. This is necessary to ensure that production is not slowed down or halted, because physical resources or labour aren't being used properly. If components or raw materials have not been ordered in time, for example, machines and workers may not be able to produce anything, but they would still have to paid for. This would cause the firm unnecessary costs, which could have been avoided through good production planning. Examiner's note Lynne has given an excellent answer. She has shown that she understands the topic well, and has given good detailed explanations. She has also shown that she can used business terms like stock control or components correctly. This answer would probably get an 'A' grade.	6
Martin and Ashley started their window cleaning business with Â£1,500 they borrowed from Ashley's dad, and a Â£550 bank loan. They used the money to buy a second hand van and cleaning equipment. Ashley's dad doesn't charge any interest. They pay him back Â£50 a month. They also have to pay the bank Â£50 a month over two years. They don't get many bookings in winter when the weather is bad. Martin and Ashley aim to pay themselves Â£50 a month each. What costs do Martin and Ashley have to meet even when they have no customers? (10 marks) When you have finished take a look at the sample answers on the next page.	6
Jamie wrote: They have got to pay back the money they borrowed. Examiner's note Jamie needs to give far more explanation. He should use business terms and show he understands what fixed costs are. Morag wrote: They have to pay Ashley's father each month, as well as the loan from the bank. They may have other costs, like the cleaning materials they buy to run their business. Examiner's note Morag started her answer quite well, mentioning both loans which, as fixed costs, have to be repaid. The cleaning materials, however, form part of the variable, rather than the fixed costs. Rani wrote: Costs which have to be paid, regardless of the level of output, are called fixed costs. Martin and Ashley have the fixed costs of repaying Ashley's dad Â£50 a month, and they probably pay bank interest on the loan. Their pay is a fixed cost. They might want to consider paying themselves piece rate, to help their business survive. The road tax and insurance on the van are fixed costs they have to pay. They have already bought the van, so this is a sunk cost, and no longer a fixed cost they have to pay. Examiner's note Rani's answer would probably get a A grade. She has answered the question well, and has shown she can use business terms like fixed costs. She has thought about the pay they only receive when they have the business, and correctly counted it as a fixed cost.	6
You need to be able to calculate values such as power [power: The rate at which energy is transferred or work is done, measured in 'W'. Power = work done Ã· time taken. ], resistance [resistance: The opposition in an electrical component to the flow of electricity through it. Resistance is measured in ohms. ], circuit outputoutput: the term denoting either an exit or changes which exit a system and which activate/modify a process, and current gain [gain: the amount of amplification of the input voltage - ie how much bigger the output voltage is compared to the input voltage ]. There are a number of formulae to help you with these calculations, and you need to be familiar with these. You don't necessarily need to learn them, as you will usually be given a formula sheet in your exam. Power is the rate of energy output, or work done by a component or device. A resistor has a current of 0.025A flowing through it when it has a voltage of 9V placed across its ends. Determine whether a resistor with a 0.125W power rating will be able to handle the current value. P=V x I = 9 x 0.025 = 0.225W A resistor of 0.125 Watts would therefore be too low to handle the 0.025A current.	6
These are used to determine the time constant [time constant: in a resistance/capacitance circuit, the time constant is the time taken to charge the capacitor, through the resistor, to 63% of its full charge - or to discharge it to 37% of its initial voltage. ] for a resistor and capacitor in series. The time constant can be used to calculate time delays. The formula is T = C x R A capacitor and a resistor are connected in series. Determine the time constant for capacitance charging if the capacitor has a value of 100 micro-farads [micro-farads: units of capacitance equal to 1 millionth of a farad ] and the resistor value is 100 kilo-ohms [kilo-ohms: units of resistance equal to 1000 ohms ]>. Note that the capacitance has been changed to whole farads (ie divided by 1,000,000) and the resistance has been changed to ohms (ie multiplied by 1,000). T = C x R = 100/1,000,000 x (100 x 1000) = 10 seconds	6
Counter circuits record the number of times an event takes place. The counter circuit you are most likely to come across is the 4017 decade counter IC, which can be set to count to any value between one and 10 , over and over again. The 4017 is a complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) integrated circuit. A decade counter has ten outputs. When it is turned on, the counter switches from one output to the next. The speed at which each output turns on or 'goes high' is determined by a timer connected to an input. The counter is switched on and off using either a manual switch or with an astable 555 timer (using pin 3 on the 555 as the output). Below is a pin-out diagram showing the arrangement of pins in a 4017 counter chip, and a guide to what each pin does. Pin-out diagram for a 4017 decade counter The circuit below shows a decade counter being used as a random number generator or electronic dice. The input 14 can be connected to a 555 timer to operate the dice. A switch has been connected to pin 13, which will stop the dice when pressed.	6
Digital circuits are made up of digital switches called gates. Logic gateslogic gatecircuit component which takes several inputs, compares them with each other, and provides a single output based on a logical function such as AND, OR or NOT. control outputs depending on whether the switches are on or off. A logic gate's behaviour can be described using the terms AND, OR and NOT - or combinations of these. Programmable interface controllers (PICs) are automated logic gates - digital control devices which can be programmed to behave in preset ways given certain inputs. Logic gates are at the heart of digital electronics. A single digital signal can be either ON or OFF, but if there is more than one signal, there are more than two possible states. For example, if there are two signals present there are four possible combinations - ON/ON, ON/OFF, OFF/ON and OFF/OFF - and each combination will produce a different outcome. This is a logic gate. The graphic shows an AND gate with 2 inputs, both of which can be either ON (represented by 1) or OFF (represented by 0). Because this is an AND gate, both inputs must be ON for there to be an output. The table on the right shows all the possible combinations of inputs and outputs (with the output ON state represented by a 1). Now look at an OR gate with the same inputs. An OR gate allows the output to be ON as long as either A or B are ON. The table on the right - called a truth table - shows all the possible inputs and outputs There are six types of primitive (basic) logic gates that are used in the design of logic systems. The activity allows you to select input states for different logic gates. The truth table shows the possible outcomes for each gate.	6
Logic gates are used to build up complex logic systems, such as burglar alarms and combination locks. The diagram below shows a complex logic gate combining three simple gates. Altogether there are three inputs and eight possible outcomes. To complete a truth table do a whole column before moving to the next column. To solve the table below first find D, then E and finally Z. D depends only on A, E depends on B And C, and X depends on E Or D.	6
A well-designed and manufactured product starts with good planning and documentation including a design brief [design brief: a set of instructions given to a designer by a client. ] and specification [specification: a statement that tells the designer exactly what the product has to do and what the design requirements are. ]. Circuits are first modelled using a prototype board, before being assembled into a PCB [PCB: Printed Circuit Board ]. Evaluation and testing needs to be built in at critical control points [critical control points: the predefined points in a manufacture system where quality control checks take place. ] such as initial design, breadboard and PCB phases, and at the manufacturing stage. And you need to be familiar with the ways that CAD[an error occurred while processing this directive] is used in the electronics design process. A design procedure is a series of steps which guide you through any electronic design-and-make process. Sticking to the procedure will help deliver a first-class product. Once you have defined the purpose of your project, there are two important documents you need to write. The specification for an electronic product should include electronic factors such as component details, maximum working voltages, maximum currents, and temperature or frequency ranges. The factors which make a product efficient, safe and comfortable to use are called ergonomics. Considerations of style - the things which make a product look and feel good - are called aesthetics. You need to consider both ergonomic and aesthetic factors when planning your designs. When designing circuits, for example, ensure that switches and other control components are placed so that they can be easily reached, and that output components such as LEDs can be easily seen. A product's style is a more subjective matter, as different people may have different ideas of what looks good. Think about contemporary style, about what is currently fashionable, when designing your product. You may not want to follow the fashion - but you still need to know what it is!	6
There are many advantages to using computers in electronics design. They speed up the design process, enabling changes to be made very quickly. They enable circuits and products to be modelled before manufacture. And they make it easy and cheap to store and edit design specifications, and then download them onto machines for manufacturing. Computer software specially written to facilitate product design is called CAD[an error occurred while processing this directive] software. Several different CAD packages can be used to build up and test circuits on screen, so that you can try out a circuit before making it, or design a PCB [PCB: Printed Circuit Board ] or vero-board. Crocodile Clips, Livewire, and PCB Wizard are three common circuit-modelling packages. Designers also use CAD to make accurate 2D and 3D drawings of circuits and products, and for solid modelling [solid modelling: use of digital drawings based on geometric shapes, used for solid objects such as car components. ] to show how products will look when finished. Different colours and textures can be added to the model and the product can be rotated to show different views. Computers are often used to design electronic logic gates for PIC circuits [PIC circuits: circuits controlled by a PIC (Programmable Interface Controller) - a device which can be programmed by a computer to control complex circuits ]. PIC programs are usually built up from a computerised flow chart [flow chart: a graphic outline of the sequence of operations needed to complete a task ], and then be burnt or downloaded onto a PIC chip.	6
Designers have a responsibility for the effects of the products they design, and need to think about their potential impact on the environment. They also need to be very safety-conscious, as there are a number of potential hazards [hazards: anything likely to cause harm and/or damage ] involved in the design and making of electronic products. Electronic product designers should seek to use technology in a responsible way, which means (among other things) taking into account the impact a product is likely to have on the environment. For this reason, designers should have an awareness of key environmental issues, and know about the main regulations on environmental protection, recycling etc. There are various ways that design can impact on the environment these include:-. A renewable resource is one which can be renewed in a relatively short time. Timber from managed softwood forests is renewable, because these trees can be re-grown in a few years. Hardwood timber is non-renewable, as these trees take hundreds of years to be replaced and the forests where they grow are disappearing. By-products: Office Waste Most manufacturing processes produce various kinds of waste as a by-product. Sometimes these by-products contain toxic substances which are harmful to people or the environment. Biodegradability: Plastic cutlery Biodegradable materials decompose relatively quickly into naturally-occuring substances - as opposed to non-biodegradable ones (eg most plastics) that take many years to decompose. This is an especially important factor when considering packaging materials, which are usually thrown way without any further use. Recyclable materials are ones which can be easily and cheaply reprocessed to fulfill another use. Examples of recycled materials include card and paper, metals and thermoplastics. Manufactured boards should be made from reconstituted and recycled timber. Apart from thinking about any harmful by-products, designers should avoid using materials in their products which may be harmful to people and animals. Components in toys which are small enough to swallow, or a model finished with a paint containing lead are both examples. Such materials may seem innocent enough during the design stage - only becoming obvious as hazards when a child chokes on the component or is poisoned by the lead.	6
Some of the equipment you use in electronics will be connected to the mains voltage supply, at 240 volts. It is therefore really important that you always adopt a safety-conscious approach when building and testing electronic circuits. Be particularly careful with equipment such as soldering irons, signal generators [signal generators: devices for generating repeated electronic signals ], oscilloscopes [oscilloscopes: devices which gives a visual display of voltage, current or power in the form of a graph or waveform ] and power supplies. Make sure that plugs are secure, wires are not frayed and that they are used correctly. If there are any doubts about the safety or reliability of any piece of equipment please do not use it and inform a member of staff as soon as is possible. Ideally, before starting your project work you should complete a risk assessment [Risk Assessment: process of working out the likelihood of harm or damage being caused, by hazards which have been identified. ] to help prevent any health and safety problems occurring during your practical work.	6
Designers have a responsibility for the effects of the products they design, and need to think about their potential impact on the environment. They also need to be very safety-conscious, as there are a number of potential hazards [hazards: anything likely to cause harm and/or damage ] involved in the design and making of electronic products. Electronic product designers should seek to use technology in a responsible way, which means (among other things) taking into account the impact a product is likely to have on the environment. For this reason, designers should have an awareness of key environmental issues, and know about the main regulations on environmental protection, recycling etc. There are various ways that design can impact on the environment these include:-. A renewable resource is one which can be renewed in a relatively short time. Timber from managed softwood forests is renewable, because these trees can be re-grown in a few years.

Electronics began with the development of the transistor in the 1950s. Transistors are essentially tiny semiconductor amplifiers and/or switches, several thousands of which can be put on a 1mm2 piece of silicon. Transistors have three leads: the emitter, collector and base. The base lead controls the transistor: applying an electrical current to the base lead switches the transistor on. When the transistor is on, current flows from the collector to the emitter - but when it is off no current will flow. Transistors are easily damaged, so it is important not to mix up the three leads. To help identify the leads some transistors have a dot near the collector, and/or a tab near the emitter. Each type of transistor is identified by a code printed on the side. Some transistors can take a very low current flowing in the base and amplify it to give a much higher current in the collector (called gain [gain: the amount of amplification of the input voltage - ie how much bigger the output voltage is compared to the input voltage ]). Other transistors can output a large current at the collector - but without very much gain. Single transistors cannot have both high gain and high collector current. To overcome this problem, a high-gain transistor is paired up with a high-current transistor in what is called a Darlington pair. The combined transistors allows both a higher gain and a larger amount of current to flow than would be possible with a single transistor. Darlington pairs are often used to drive motors. Transistors are often used as interface devices - that is, devices which ensure that the right amount of current is supplied to power another device, such as an output component. Examples of output components that might require transistors are direct current motors, solenoids and meters.	6
Potential dividers are used for dividing up the voltage, so that a part or parts of a circuit only receive the voltage they require. Potential dividers consist of two or more components (usually resistors [resistors: components which resists or 'slows down' the current in a circuit by acting against the flow of electrons. Resistance is measured in ohms. ]) arranged in series [in series: connected to a circuit in such a way that the same current flows through each component in turn. Opposite of in parallel ] across a power supply. The circuit diagrams below show three common types of potential divider: two fixed resistors [fixed resistors: type of resistor whose resistance remains constant. Opposite of a variable resistor ] in series, a fixed resistor and LDR [LDR: Light Dependent Resistor, or LDR, is a type of resistor which is affected by changes in light levels. A cadmium sulphide layer causes a decrease in resistance in the light and increase in the dark. ] in series, and a thermistor [thermistor: type of resistor that changes resistance with temperature - also called a Temperature-Dependent Resistor. Usually the resistance decreases with an increase in temperature (and vice versa) ] and variable resistor [variable resistor: type of resistor whose resistance can be varied to change the amount of current flowing through it. Opposite of a fixed resistor ] in series. (Note that the resistors are usually drawn vertically on a circuit diagram.) A circuit diagram, a Thermistor and variable resistor Potential dividers are important in both transistor-switching circuits and op-amp comparator circuits [comparator circuits: circuit with a comparator - a component which compares two voltages or currents, amplifies the difference between them, and changes its output depending on the result of the comparison ]. The diagram shows a darkness sensor circuit with a transistor [transistor: components which do not conduct electricity unless they are turned on by a (different) electrical current. This means they can be used as switches, amplifiers and in other ways. ] used as a switch. When the LDR senses a drop in light, the LED is switched on. When the LDR has light falling on it, its resistance is low - usually around 400 Ohms. When the LDR is covered up the resistance increases, (often to many kilo-Ohms). When the resistance of the LDR is small its share of the voltage supply is small too, so Vout from the voltage divider is small, and the transistor is switched off. In the dark the large resistance of the LDR takes a large share of the voltage supply, so Vout is large and the transistor and LED both switch on.	6
An electronics product can be thought of as a system with inputs, processes and outputs. The most common method of manufacturing electronic products is the batch method - though one-off production and continuous-flow production are also important. ICT is used extensively in electronics manufacturing. The use of machines that are controlled by computers is called computer-aided manufacture or CAM. Electronics systems diagrams are used to show how the parts of a product work together. Many electronic products are made up of a number of standard system circuits (circuits that are common to many different products), such as sensors, amplifiers, timers, counters and output devices. System diagrams usually take the form of a block diagram in which each part of the electronic system is represented by an input, a process or an output. The block diagrams below shows two types of system. Close-loop system and a closed-loop system	6
There are four basic types of production system used in electronics - each one using different types of machine and with different levels of automation. Which system is used depends generally on how many identical products are to be produced, and how continuous the production is to be. This is used to produce very small amounts or specialised electronic products. This might mean producing a single piece of switch gear for a factory machine. Workers in this type of industry need to be highly skilled in a range of different areas and able to work on a number of aspects of the project. This is the most common type of production in the electronics industry. It involves making a set number of exactly the same product. Some batches will be small, others could be thousands. Batch production might be used to make PCBs for aircraft controls, for example, or control panels for central-heating boilers.In batch production the operation is sub-divided into a number of separate stages, with each stage being completed by different (often computer-controlled) machines. This is used when very many identical products are required, such as electronic circuits for cars, washing machines and fridges. The products are assembled as they flow along a production line. The operators tend to be semi-skilled. In-line production plants are very expensive to set up and thousands of products have to be sold to off-set the capital costs. Production is often difficult to plan and breakdowns are costly. This is where production is heavily automated and runs 24 hours per day. Continuous-flow production is used in oil refining and chemical processing. A considerable amount of electronic control is used in the running and monitoring of these plants.	6

Some of the advantages of using computer-aided manufacturing are that When computers are used to carry out bespoke precision tasks, such as soldering circuit boards, this is called computer numerical control or CNC. CNC machines can be programmed and operated from computers or other microprocessor systems - either directly using a keyboard or keypad, or indirectly by means of disks, smart cards or other removable media. In electronics CNC machines are used - among other applications - to 'populate' PCBs and solder the components in place.	6
Switches, relays and transducers are mechanical or electrical devices which are used to connect and disconnect circuits (switches and relays) or to produce an output from a circuit by changing one form of energy into another (transducers). Switches are devices for connecting and disconnecting circuits. Different types of switches have different numbers of poles [poles: output terminals or contacts in a switch ] and throws [throws: circuits or conducting positions controlled by each pole of a switch ]. There are four main types of mechanical switches used in circuits. The description given to these depends on the function of the switch. The single throw switches are either open or closed. Double pole single throw switches are often used to switch between two outputs. The double throw switches are used to change from one part of a circuit to another. The double pole double throw can be used to reverse the direction of a motor. The dotted lines on the symbols indicate that both sides move together. Switches are available in a wide range of forms that include rotary, key, membrane, mercury, tremble and toggle. Push switches are a type of SPST switch. They can be either Push to make switches, which are normally open (NO) or Push to break switches, which are normally closed (NC).	6
Relays are a special type of switch which is turned on and off by an electromagnet. Below is a diagram of a simple relay. When a current flows through the coil an electro-magnetic field is set up. The field attracts an iron armature, whose other end pushes the contacts together, completing the circuit. When the current is switched off, the contacts open again, switching the circuit off. A useful property of relays is that the circuit powering the coil is completely separate from the circuit switched on by the relay. For this reason relays are often used where a safe low-voltage circuit is being used to control a high-voltage circuit. The relays used in schools generally a have voltage between 6V and 15V. When using a diode with a relay, be sure that it is connected across the poles (terminals) of the relay to prevent damage to the transistor from back EMF generated when the relay coil switches off.	6
An output transducer is an output device which works by changing one form of energy (eg electrical energy) into another form of energy (eg sound or light energy). Loudspeakers (and headphones) are output transducers that change electrical energy into sound. Most loudspeakers are moving coil types. The core of the loudspeaker vibrates in and out very quickly. This produces sound waves that can be picked up by the human ear. Most loud speakers have a resistance value of 8 Ohms. You need to take this value into account when matching the loudspeaker up with the electronic circuit that will operate it. Digital displays are transducers that change electrical energy into light energy. Digital displays can be found in watches, microwave ovens, mobile phones and car dashboard displays. Two common types of digital display are seven-segment displays and liquid-crystal displays. Resistors should be used in series with the displays to prevent the diode segments from being damaged.	6

"Food deteriorates over time, and the rate of deterioration is determined by food acidity, oxidation, and food temperature. The acidity [acidity: the amount of acid in a substance, shown by a low pH. Can also means 'sharp or tart to taste'. ] or pH of a food affects both its taste and the rate at which microorganisms grow within it. Oxidation [oxidation: chemical reaction in which a substance combines with oxygen ] of food is caused by enzymes in the food reacting with oxygen in the air. This enzymic discolouring can be slowed by the addition of an acidic substance. Both heating and cooling can be used to vary the rate at which food deteriorates as a result of the action of microorganisms [microorganisms: microscopic (too small to see) organisms such as bacteria and viruses ]. Some foods, such as citrus fruits, are acidic; others, such as sodium bicarbonate, are alkaline [alkaline: opposite to acidic. Alkaline substances react with acids, neutralising them, and forming salts. ]. The more acid the food is, the lower it will be on the pH scale. The more alkaline the food is, the higher it will be on the pH scale. Foods that are neither acid nor alkaline (for example pure water) are called neutral and have a pH value of 7. Acidity or alkalinity of food is important for two reasons: it affects the taste of a product and it affects the rate at which microorganisms grow within and upon food. For example, lemon juice can be used to reduce the pH level of yoghurt, to a pH below 4.5. This inhibits the growth of microorganisms, making the yoghurt last longer, but it will also give it a sharp taste. Three types of microorganisms affect food: bacteria [bacteria: Single-celled micro-organisms, some of which are pathogenic in humans, animals and plants. Singular is bacterium. ], moulds [moulds: multi-cellular microorganisms. They are made up of many tiny fungi (spores), which travel by air to land on food surfaces. ] and yeasts [yeasts: Yeasts are single-celled organisms found on the skin of fruit which aid its deterioration. ]. By a natural chain of events, these microorganisms will cause food to change - often, but not always, making food ""bad"" or unpalatable [unpalatable: unpleasant to taste ]."	6
"Both heating and cooling food can change its susceptibility to microorganisms [microorganisms: microscopic (too small to see) organisms such as bacteria and viruses ], and therefore its ability to stay fresh. Keeping foods such as dairy produce, cooked foods and raw food ingredients in a refrigerator at a temperature from 0Â°C to 3Â°C will slow the growth of microorganisms such as bacteria, but won't stop it entirely. Storing food in a freezer makes long-term storage possible by making bacteria dormant. Many different types of food are quickly frozen in factories to maintain high standards of freshness and safety. Products are stored in commercial freezers at between -18Â°C and -29Â°C. Home freezers store products at -18Â°C. Freezing does not kill bacteria, but will keep them dormantdormant: A volcano is classed as dormant when it is temporarily inactive but not fully extinct.. Cook-chilled foods can be cooked from frozen without defrosting. The downside is that cook-chilled foods have a short lifespan and have to be thoroughly reheated before eating - to at least 72Â°C - to avoid the risk of food poisoning. Leftovers should be disposed of quickly. In the factory, the foods are prepared by cooking them to 70Â°C for two minutes to destroy microorganisms. Food is packaged into portions and blast-chilled. Here the temperature is instantly lowered and stored at 0Â°C to 4Â°C. UHT is used for products such as ""long-life"" milk. The product is heated to a temperature of 132Â°C to 140Â°C for one second to destroy all bacteria. Then the food is rapidly cooled."	6

Food can also be affected by the oxygen in air. When some fresh fruit, such as an apple or pear, is cut or peeled, the outside surfaces darken and turn brown, making the food seem unattractive. The browning is caused by enzymes [enzymes: proteins which catalyse or speed up chemical reactions inside our bodies ] in the fruit reacting to the oxygen in the air. By adding an acid (eg lemon juice) or sugary solution (eg syrup), the enzymic browning or discolouring action is slowed down.

All foods are made up of a framework of different substances and have different parts to play. You need to be familiar with the three main food groups - proteins, carbohydrates and fats. You may also need to know about minerals, vitamins and fibre. Different foods such as oil, eggs, fruit, milk and flour, have different properties, including flavouring, preserving, sweetening and thickening. These properties are very useful when preparing foods. Proteins are vital to all diets as they assist with growth/repair of the body. They are made up of amino acids [amino acids: complex molecules which form the building-blocks of proteins ]. The key property of protein is that when it is cooked it denatures (changes its properties), before coagulating and setting. Egg white, for example, is a clear, runny substance when raw. But as it is cooked it changes to become solid, white and firm in texture.	6
There are two types of carbohydrate - starch and sugar. Starch is found in cereals, cornflour, potatoes, pasta and flour. A suspension [suspension: a liquid with many fine particles dispersed or suspended in it ] forms when a starch powder (eg cornflour) is added to a liquid, such as custard (flavoured custard powder and milk). As heat is applied the suspension will gradually thicken. This is gelatinisation [gelatinisation: something gelatinises when it becomes gelatinous or turns into a jelly ]. Sugars are found in two types. There are three properties of sugar.	6
If a food product is going to be successful, it has to appeal to the target market. People's tastes and diets change over time, and foods go in and out of fashion. There are lots of reasons why people buy different foods today compared to 20 years ago. The development of a food product is divided into distinct stages - many of them identical to the development steps for any new product - with formal drawing, model-making and ICT all playing an important part. At predefined points there will need to be quality-control checks - part of a process called Quality Assurance. The food products market is affected by changing social and economic patterns. For example, many people have more income today compared with 20 years ago. This gives them more money to spend. People also lead busier lives, so they might do more shopping in supermarkets, than traditional shops, and buy more ready-made meals or eat out more, rather than cooking for themselves. Food developers need to constantly rethink the type of foods that need to be on shop shelves, in order to take account these lifestyle changes. Customers expect to find a wider range of foods, including foreign dishes and food ingredients. Many factors affect what people choose to eat. These include age, habits and presentation. Different sectors of the community will choose to eat different types of food, for example the factors that are most likely to convince teenagers to buy foods are convenience, trend, taste, cheapness, but teenagers do not generally care if food is environmentally-friendly. Consumers are becoming more concerned about what they eat.	6
Perhaps the most important of these is the use of orthographic projection (sometimes also called a third-angle projection) to show a three-dimensional product on a two-dimensional piece of paper. An orthographic projection is an accurate, scale-drawing [scale-drawing: a drawing of an object which shows it 'to scale' - ie, all the object's actual dimensions are reduced by the same ratio (eg, 25:1) on the drawing. ] of a product, shown from three different viewpoints: the side, the front and in plan. The scale used in the drawing is shown mathematically in a ratio - eg 1:2 (half actual size) or 1:10 (one tenth actual size). Image shows a diagram of the three views of a milk carton. The ratio is 1:2. The graphic shows an orthographic projection of a milk carton, with each view labelled and major dimensions given in millimetres. Note that the scale is clearly stated - don't forget to do this on your drawings!	6
Guarding against hazards: food workers in a prawn processing plant Safety is vitally important in the food industry, for obvious reasons. As in any other type of production, the most important part of safety-consciousness is identifying and monitoring potential hazards [hazards: anything likely to cause harm and/or damage ] (this is called hazard analysis) and taking steps to avoid them. The Control of Substance Hazardous to Health (COSHH) regulations help to protect workers in the food and other industry from hazardous substances such as cleaning fluids and pesticides. It encourages employers to put safety procedures in place to prevent accidents. Assured Safe Catering System (ASCS) is a set of procedures used by caterers to ensure food is always safe to eat. This is based on Hazard Analysis Critical Control Points (HACCP) principles. Critical control points (CCPs) are pre-determined checks which take place at specified points in the food production or preparation process. They must be carefully documented, with details of the checks themselves, the processes being checked, any faults and remedial action taken. Some of these checks will be done by hand - others may be computerised under CAM.	6
Drawings giving detailed information about structure, dimensions, materials, and assembly instructions for a graphic product are done using one of a number of formal techniques. The main ones are isometric projection, planometric projection, perspective drawing, and - for working drawings - orthographic projection, section drawings and assembly drawings. Because these formal drawings need to last and be used by others, you need to think about the preservation and presentation of your work. In isometric projection [projection: a representation of a three-dimensional solid on a two-dimensional surface ] all vertical lines on an object remain vertical [vertical: at right-angles to the horizon; straight up-and-down ] while horizontal lines are drawn at 30Â° to the horizontal [horizontal: parallel to the horizon; left-to-right and flat ]. Isometric drawings are usually produced with drawing equipment to ensure accuracy. Isometric projection distorts shapes slightly in order to keep all upright lines vertical (and because perspective is ignored). Their advantage is that they show the object's dimensions accurately and in correct proportion to each other, making it easy to draw the projection correctly to scale [to scale: having a fixed relationship to the actual dimensions of an object. The relationship is usually stated as a ratio, eg 25:1. ] from a plan [plan: scale drawing showing an object as seen in a cutaway view from directly above ] view.	6
In perspective drawing the forward face or edge of the object is drawn first, with the other lines receding away from the viewer and gradually approaching each other - just as they appear to do when you look at a real object. If the receding lines are extended they will meet at points that are called vanishing points. Perspective drawing can be done using drawing equipment or freehand. Perspective drawing can use one, two or three vanishing points. One-point perspective is often used for room interiors. Two-point perspective has many applications for developing ideas in 3D. Three-point perspective is often used for drawings of tall buildings. The advantage of perspective drawing is that it makes objects appear more realistic, as objects appear to get smaller as their distance from the observer increases.	6
Drawings which contain all the information needed to make the object you have designed, including dimensions and details of components, materials and assembly instructions, are called working drawings. Although working drawings for simple products may sometimes be done in isometric or planometric projection, the normal drawing technique for working drawings is orthographic projection. Some products may need a section drawing to give extra structural information, or an assembly drawing to show how parts fit together. Orthographic projection shows complex objects by doing a 2D drawing of each side to show the main features. Orthographic drawings usually consist of a front view, a side view and a plan [plan: scale drawing showing an object as seen in a cutaway view from directly above ], but more views may be shown for complex objects with lots of detail. A drawing board and parallel motion or T-square is used to project one view from another. Orthographic drawing may be done using first angle projection or third angle projection. The graphic below shows the differences between the two. Section drawings show the various parts of a product as if it had been sliced in half. (Sometimes they are called cross-sections.) The position of the imaginary cut is called a section plane, sometimes represented by a line consisting of long and short dashes. The purpose of a section drawing is to make clear how a product is constructed. Parts of the object that are cut through are shaded with lines at 45Â° and spaced 4mm apart - called cross-hatching. If two parts of a product are touching, then the cross-hatching goes in opposite directions. Parts such as nuts and bolts and axles are not normally sectioned. An assembly drawing shows the various parts of a product drawn to show exactly how they fit together. They are often used for products such as construction and model kits or flat-pack furniture, to show the user how to assemble the parts. They can be drawn in two ways.	6
Drawings giving detailed information about structure, dimensions, materials, and assembly instructions for a graphic product are done using one of a number of formal techniques. The main ones are isometric projection, planometric projection, perspective drawing, and - for working drawings - orthographic projection, section drawings and assembly drawings. Because these formal drawings need to last and be used by others, you need to think about the preservation and presentation of your work. In isometric projection [projection: a representation of a three-dimensional solid on a two-dimensional surface ] all vertical lines on an object remain vertical [vertical: at right-angles to the horizon; straight up-and-down ] while horizontal lines are drawn at 30Â° to the horizontal [horizontal: parallel to the horizon; left-to-right and flat ]. Isometric drawings are usually produced with drawing equipment to ensure accuracy. Isometric projection distorts shapes slightly in order to keep all upright lines vertical (and because perspective is ignored). Their advantage is that they show the object's dimensions accurately and in correct proportion to each other, making it easy to draw the projection correctly to scale [to scale: having a fixed relationship to the actual dimensions of an object. The relationship is usually stated as a ratio, eg 25:1. ] from a plan [plan: scale drawing showing an object as seen in a cutaway view from directly above ] view. In planometric projection (also sometimes called axonometric projection) all vertical lines on an object remain vertical, while horizontal lines are drawn at 45Â°. Again it is usually done using drawing equipment. Planometric projections (like isometric drawings) show all dimensions accurately and to scale, and are frequently used to show buildings or room layouts. As they are drawn with 45Â° angles, planometric drawings show one plane of the object with no distortion at all, so that a circular object - say, a stool on the floor - can be shown as a true circle and drawn with a pair of compasses. In perspective drawing the forward face or edge of the object is drawn first, with the other lines receding away from the viewer and gradually approaching each other - just as they appear to do when you look at a real object. If the receding lines are extended they will meet at points that are called vanishing points. Perspective drawing can be done using drawing equipment or freehand. Perspective drawing can use one, two or three vanishing points. One-point perspective is often used for room interiors. Two-point perspective has many applications for developing ideas in 3D. Three-point perspective is often used for drawings of tall buildings. The advantage of perspective drawing is that it makes objects appear more realistic, as objects appear to get smaller as their distance from the observer increases. Drawings which contain all the information needed to make the object you have designed, including dimensions and details of components, materials and assembly instructions, are called working drawings. Although working drawings for simple products may sometimes be done in isometric or planometric projection, the normal drawing technique for working drawings is orthographic projection.

An assembly drawing shows the various parts of a product drawn to show exactly how they fit together. They are often used for products such as construction and model kits or flat-pack furniture, to show the user how to assemble the parts. They can be drawn in two ways. Formal drawings are working documents, so they need to be looked after and presented in such a way that anyone can read them. Mounting drawings on paper or card makes them more durable and accessible. A pale coloured background may sometimes help with the presentation of a drawing. This can be done using coloured paper or card, a colourwash [colourwash: the application of colour to a drawing, normally done using watercolour paint and intended to give a pale tint to a drawing. ], pastels, or computer graphics applications.	6
Sketches may be a way of getting ideas down onto paper quickly, or they may be quite complex and highly-finished. You need to know a number of techniques for drawing and enhancing sketches. To draw well you need to know how to draw certain geometrical shapes (eg quadrilaterals, circles and ellipses) and solids (eg cubes, prisms and cones) which are commonly used in graphic design. Finally you need to be able to be familiar with graphical ways of representing data, such as symbols, graphs and charts. Sketching is a way of putting ideas down on paper quickly. It is done freehand, but a piece of grid paper may be useful. Sketches may be two-dimensional (2D) or three-dimensional (3D). For sketching complex shapes, a box or series of boxes can be used as a guide. This is called a crating or wire-frame drawing. When sketching, use any medium with which you feel comfortable. Pencils and fine-line markers are particularly good. Limited colour may be used on quick sketches. Use a level of detail sufficient to show the main points of an idea. Do not show unnecessary detail. Sketches should be sufficiently clear to allow other people to understand your ideas. Sketch models can be quickly-made 3D models to show spaces or moving parts. They are made from suitable materials and will usually supplement paper-based sketches.	6
There are a range of techniques for enhancing the appearance of a drawing, making it look more like the real object. The technique used will depend on the type of drawing and what you are trying to show. For this technique, thin lines are used in between adjoining surfaces. Thick lines are suitable when only one side can be seen. The drawing illustrates the idea. Tone refers to different shades of the same colour. A lighter tone is called a tint and is made by adding white to the base colour. A darker tone is called a shade and is made by adding black to the base colour. Tone can also be shown by using patterns of lines, dots, shading, reflections and highlights. It is also possible to obtain sheets of dry transfer material to represent different tones. There are a number of ways of showing on paper the texture of materials used to make a product. These are intended to give an impression of the material, rather than represent it exactly. Some examples include drawing the grain on pieces of wood or drawing lines at angles to show reflected light on clear glass or plastics. Textures can be represented in shades of grey or colour. Colour is an important part of graphic design. You need to know the following facts about colour. The colour wheel illustrates how the colours relate to each other.	6
The main geometrical shapes used in graphics are triangles, quadrilaterals, regular polygons, circles and ellipses. Click on the shapes below to see how to draw them. Here are some guidelines to help you when drawing these shapes. Polygons are shapes with three or more straight sides. A quadrilateral where opposite sides are the same length, but none of the angles are 90Â°, is called a parallelogram. A parallelogram where all four sides are the same length is called a rhombus.	6
The main geometrical solids used in representing graphic products are the cube, cuboid, triangular prism, hexagonal prism, square-based pyramid, cylinder and cone. Click on the solids below to see how to draw them. Here are some guidelines to help you when drawing these solids. Cubes have six faces. All faces are square, with equal-length sides and angles of 90Â°. Cuboids have six rectangular faces. The opposite faces are equal and all the angles are right angles at 90Â°. Hexagonal prisms have eight sides. The two ends are hexagons. The six sides are square or rectangular. Cylinders have two ends that are circles and one continuous face around the outside. If this was opened out the flat the side of a cylinder would be a large rectangle. Triangular prisms have five sides. The two ends are triangles. The sides are square or rectangular. Cones have a base that is a circle. One face goes all round and narrows towards a point at the top. Pyramids are usually square-based. This square-based pyramid has five faces. The base of is a square. The four sides are triangles, which all meet at a point at the top. There are also triangle-based (with a triangle base and three sides) and hexagon-based pyramids (with a hexagon base and six sides), among other variations.	6
Numerical data is often represented using graphs and charts. Charts can be extremely useful in planning your work on a graphic design project. There are several types of planning chart. Gantt charts show the different tasks involved in making a product and whether there can be overlaps in different tasks. They are useful for complex planning where various tasks can be done at the same time, or where two or more people are working on the same product. Flow charts describe in words the sequence of operations. Flow charts are useful for simple tasks. Arrows show direction. Different-shaped boxes signify different stages. These show the process of making something in words and pictures. They are useful if you need to tell someone else how to do a job or how to use something.	6

A surface development - also called a net - is a shape cut from sheet material to make a 3D form. Developments can be used for any shape: cube, cuboid, prism, pyramid, cylinder or cone. The diagram below shows the development for a cube. If the 3D form is made from board, tags have to be added to show where it will be glued together.

Signs and symbols are another kind of drawing used to convey information. Signs and symbols stand in for words. Examples include road signs and information signs at airports and railway stations. Car drivers will know what most of the signs below mean without any need for written instruction. How many of them do you know?	6
'Quality' in graphics can refer to either of two things: the quality of the design - ie how well the product meets the needs of the user; and the quality of manufacture - ie how well the product has been made. It is perfectly possible for a product to be designed well, but poorly made; or well-made, but poorly designed. For example, a pop-up book may be highly specified and look great on the drawing-board (well-designed) but have innacurate cutting of the moving parts, rough edges, and badly made page joints (poorly made). Alternatively, it could be beautifully made, but have a gauge of card specified which is too thin to stand up to the frequent movement and rough use it is going to get from its users (poorly designed). Consumers want not just high-quality software, but high-quality user-manuals as well In order to meet the needs of the user, the designer obviously has to know what they are.	6
Graphic media are the different techniques used in designing graphical products - for example pencil or paint. Whichever medium you use, you will need to make drawings, and so you need to know how to use basic drawing tools. Computers are increasingly used in every aspect of graphic design and production. Graphic media are the techniques used to draw, make or present images. Different media produce images with different qualities, so you need to pick the right media for the type of image you want to create. The main graphic media are listed below.	6
Increasingly computers are used to make drawings. Computers have many advantages. Adobe Photoshop is the best-known bitmap photo-manipulation software. There are software packages for two-dimensional and three-dimensional drawing. Some two-dimensional drawing packages will allow pictorial views to be drawn on an isometric [isometric: a projection which shows an object at an oblique angle but with all dimensions to scale ] or oblique grid. Bitmap software draws in pixels - tiny dots of colour arranged in patterns to make an image, like photos in a newspaper. The amount of detail you can draw depends on the number of pixels per square inch (PSI) . Most clipart is in bitmap format, as are images from digital cameras. Photo-manipulation software allows images to be altered, and text to be added. The disadvantage is that bitmap images lose detail if they are scaled up, because the same number of pixels must now spread out over a larger area. Vector software draws in co-ordinates giving the position, length and angle of lines. If the image is edited, the software works out the new co-ordinates in order to redraw the image. This gives far greater control over the image - for example, allowing it to be scaled up indefinately with no loss of detail. Key terms used in computer drawing. Desktop-publishing (DTP) software allows you to create page layouts that combine text and graphics. These elements are placed in frames that can be positioned anywhere on the page. In the past, the text was created using word-processing software and imported into the DTP software; today, it is possible to create the text directly in the DTP software if required. Some modern word-processing software can create many DTP-style effects, so the use of separate DTP software may not be needed. There are three key effects achieved using DTP software.	6

Different media produce images with different qualities, so you need to pick the right media for the type of image you want to create. The main graphic media are listed below. Drawing equipment is designed to help you to make formal drawings quickly and accurately. You will often need to incorporate written information in your drawings. You can do this either in neat handwriting, with a stencil, or using dry transfers. For best results use a drafting pen, and a T-square or parallel motion to ensure the lettering is level.

A wide range of materials can be used in making models of graphic products. Different models require different materials and a whole range of materials can be employed in one product. The list below explains the different types of modelling materials and their uses. The purpose of a model is to represent the finished product. There are a range of different techniques used to give a good finish. The main finishing techniques for different materials are listed below.	6
Materials for making products are often improved and refined. Sometimes new materials are developed, or new uses are found for existing materials. An example of a new use for an existing material is high-density foam. It was developed as a packaging material but is now often used for three-dimensional models. The development of new hardware often leads to a demand for new materials. An example of this is the development of new types of paper to be used in colour printers for printing digital photographic images. These are the main types of modern materials.	6
Graphic products use a large number of components, which can be grouped into three categories. Found items are meant for other purposes, but are also used in graphics. Examples of found items are:- Round wire nails with large head; oval nails with small head Round or countersunk screws are available in a range of different metals, with either slot or posidrive heads; self-tapping screws used with metal and plastics Three-dimensional working models as a pivot for moving parts; joining wooden or plastics components Nuts are hexagon-shaped; bolts are only threaded for part of the length; the head can be hexagon-shaped, round, countersunk or pan; washers prevent damage to surfaces	6
These printing techniques require more expensive equipment, but will be found in commercial graphics manufacturing. This method was originally done with moveable type. It is a form of relief printing - where the parts to be printed, both type and illustrations, are raised up from the base plate. It is commonly used for small printing jobs such as business cards and stationery. Illustrations for letterpress printing are made by a photographic process. Letterpress printing is not often used now, as it is time-consuming to set up the loose type and make the plates, and there is only a limited range of fonts and styles. Letterpress printing of newspapers. Nowadays flexography or offset-litho presses are used. This is similar to letterpress printing. It uses a relief [relief: Relief is the height of the ground above sea level. ] image and thin, flexible printing plates made of rubber or photopolymer. The image on the plates is produced by a photographic process, and the inks are quick-drying thin liquids. Flexography can be used to print on materials such as cellophane, polythene and metallic films, so the technique is used for printing plastic shopping bags and packaging for food products. It is also used to print newspapers and paperback books. This is the most widely used method of printing today, and is equally good for colour work as for black and white printing. The process works on the principle that oil and greasy substances do not mix with water. The plate to be printed is coated with a type of grease, then rinsed, dampened with water and coated with ink. The ink only sticks to the parts of the plate that are not wet with water. The plate is fixed to a cylinder, paper is fed through and the image is transferred onto the paper. Offset-lithography machines work using the same principle, but the paper does not come into direct contact with the printing plate, as the image is first transferred to a rubber roller. The printing plates for lithography are made by a photographic process. Lithography is used for medium and long printing runs of products such as magazines, posters, packaging and books. For this process, the image to be printed is made up of small holes sunk into the surface of the printing plate. The cells are filled with ink and the excess is scraped off the surface, then a rubber-covered roller presses paper onto the surface of the plate and into contact with the ink in the cells. The printing plates are usually made from copper and may be produced by engraving or etching. Gravure printing is used for long, high-quality print runs such as magazines, mail-order catalogues, packaging, and printing onto fabric and wallpaper. It is also used for printing postage stamps and decorative plastic laminates, such as kitchen worktops.	6
Some printed materials will need to be cut after printing, and, if necessary, creased so that they can be folded. This particularly applies to packaging, but also to pop-up cards and books, and press-out shapes for model making. A die cutter is the commonest cutting machine. The die [die: a metal block with a particular shape cut out or moulded into it - a component of many precision cutting and moulding machines. ] supports the material being cut and has a hole or a recess into which a punch made of cutting blades fits exactly. The punch and die are fitted into a punching machine, or sometimes a converted letterpress machine. The work to be cut is fitted into the machine and the punch lowered down to cut. For creasing, the same technique is used, but with blunt blades that will crease the product. Cutting can also be done with a CNC [CNC: stands for Computer Numerical Control - the use of computers to control cutting and shaping machines. A key CAM (computer-aided manufacturing) technique. ] cutter. The table below lists a number of finishing techniques that can be used on graphic products.	6
All products have an impact on the environment, and graphic products are no exception. In particular their production may contribute to deforestation and their disposal to waste pollution. Designers have a responsibility to think about moral issues like these. From THIS - forestry logs at a paper mill to THIS - waste paper mountain at a recycling plant Designers should be sensitive to the fact that certain sorts of images and text on graphic products can cause offence to certain groups of people - eg those from minority religious traditions or cultures. Special care needs to be taken in the case of images/text that are on public view, such as advertisements. Global media and mass travel means that other cultures' rich and diverse heritage of graphic images and styles is increasingly available to designers everywhere, and often are the inspiration for new design ideas.	6
All those who are involved in designing and making products have a responsibility for minimising the risk of harm to themselves or to others. Any activity or substance or tool that could potentially cause harm or damage is a hazard, and risk assessment is the process of identifying the hazards that could arise in a particular situation, and the risk of someone being hurt by them - so that steps can be taken to reduce that risk. 1. 2. 3. If the answers to any of these questions lead you think that harm may be caused, that aspect of the product should be redesigned to reduce the risk. When using cutting tools to cut card or board (eg for making models) the risk of injury will be minimised if you follow the guidelines in the table.	6
A system is a set of components arranged to carry out a particular function. All systems have inputs, processes and outputs; often they will have feedback as well. Systems for manufacturing graphics products require planning; system flowcharts are useful for this. They also need to be controlled, and these system controls can be visual, mechanical or electronic devices. Production systems also need to be checked for quality - a procedure called quality control. Graphics products manufacture can be either one-off, batch, mass-produced or continuous-flow, depending on the scale of production. Computer-aided manufacture (CAM) is widespread in all kinds of graphics production. A system is a set of components arranged to carry out a particular function. Systems may include mechanical, electrical or electronic components. The block diagram below represents a system for producing a batch of leaflets. Most systems have a fourth element - feedback - which is simply a way of changing the input or process as a result of what happens at the output. In a music system, feedback is a human response to the output from the speakers: if the music is too loud, or the radio tuned to the wrong station, the user will reduce the volume or retune the radio. An example of feedback in a production system is checking that the product meets the specification, and adjusting the process to make sure it does. Many systems have an automatic type of feedback, where feedback from one part of the system switches another part of the system on or off. This sort of system is called a closed system.	6
Systems need to be controlled if they are to continue functioning the way they were designed to do. Controls can be simple visual aids for the designer. Two examples are registration [registration: correct aligning of colour blocks in a printed product ] marks and colour bars. Registration marks are used to make sure that colour printing lines up, because the various colours must line up with each other. Registration marks are usually shown in a cross shape. Sometimes work that is to be printed has colour-separated artwork, where the artwork for each colour is on a separate sheet.Colour bars are standard bars of colour with blocks of each colour printed. This is done to show the strength and evenness of the ink used and that the registration of the colours is correct. The table lists mechanical or electronic equipment used for control and feedback in graphic production.	6
Information and communications technology is widely used in manufacturing graphics products. CAM machines are good for batch or mass production, and they are also useful for one-off products that are complicated to make. Plotter/cutters can be used either for cutting of card and vinyl, or (by replacing the blade with a pen) to produce drawings and lettering prior to cutting. Cutter/printers are more complex CAM machines which allow full-colour printing before cutting is done. These are mainly used for cutting plastics, hard wax, soft metals and wood-based materials such as MDF. They are particularly useful for making prototype models and moulds for vacuum-forming. Some of these machines can have a scanner head fitted in place of the cutting tool, allowing 3D scanning to be done.	6
Sucessful designs: Apple iPod and Dyson vacuum cleaner Designers often produce ideas for products in response to market forces. This is called consumer pull. Products may also be re-designed because of changes in materials or manufacturing methods. This is called technology push. Technological changes may allow a manufacturer to make the produce more cheaply, or more efficiently. This can reduce manufacturing costs. Occasionally a designer will design a new or improved product simply because they feel that it is needed or because a demand will be created by the very existence of the product. Two examples of this are shown below. Designs like this may succeed or fail, depending on consumer demand, how innovative the product is, and the state of the market.	6
Obviously designers have to think about what people want from a product. But consumer demand is a complex matter. Consumers are influenced by fashion, by public perceptions, by moral attitudes, and by changing lifestyles. Product designers need to consider all these factors, as well as making sure the product conforms to current laws and standards. Design is influenced by what people want, and what people want is affected by societal, cultural and market influences. These influences come in the shape of current lifestyles and fashions, and the influence of design from other times and other cultures. Market influences are partly caused by the fact that people want to have the same products as their friends. You and your friends will have similar interests, which designers have to understand if their products are to fit in with your lifestyle and sell well. Designers of mobile phones know that they have to design phones which will not only meet you and your friends' needs, but also make the right kind of 'design statement' about you the users. At the same time, however, people want to be individuals, to stand out from the crowd, and express themselves by, for example, wearing clothes that look and feel unique. Designers need to understand this desire, otherwise their products will not sell. Consumer choice is the idea that consumers should have a wide range of products to choose from, because different consumers will want different styles, different performance, and different prices when considering a purchase. Consumer choice is an influence on design, because designers need to know what their potential customers are looking for if they are going to design and make successful products. Car manufacturers, for example, will design and make the same model of car in many slightly different versions, to suit individual drivers' different tastes. Companies use market research to find out what people want. Interviews or questionnaires are used to gather people's views on the products they like, the functions and features they require, and the amount they would be prepared to pay. Sometimes the research is carefully focused on a particular group of people - eg women, people of a certain age-range or salary level - who have been identified as key potential consumers. The results of the research are then passed on to the designer, whose job it is to design products which meet these consumer expectations. When designing your own products, you also need to do some basic market research to find out your potential users' requirements.	6
Product designers should also take into account moral and environmental issues whenever they design or make a product. 'Moral issues' refers to any adverse impact the product might have on other people. 'Environmental issues' refers to any adverse impact the product might have on the environment. In practice, since people must live in the environment, it's difficult to separate these things out from each other. The list below outlines some of the key moral and environmental questions a designer should ask themselves about their product. Is the product desirable or needed? Is the cost of the product justifiable? Are the materials used renewable? Is the product energy efficient? Does the product make efficient use of natural resources? Are there any waste products which could pollute the environment? Can the product be recycled after use? Having considered the potential moral and environmental impact of a product, a designer may decide to use alternative processes, materials or chemicals. The use of alternatives may mean that some parts of the product need to be re-designed, or an alternative manufacturing process needs to be used.	6
Joints between materials can be either temporary or permanent, and may be formed with adhesives, with frame joints [frame joints: joints in which the components meet at right-angles and fit tightly with each other ], brazed or welded joints, or with fastening components such as nails, screws, bolts, and rivets [rivets: metal or plastic fasteners. The rivet is inserted into holes in the materials to be joined and then end deformed to hold it in place. ]. Joints in wood can be with screws, nails, glues and knock-down [knock-down: joint made up of separate components which are designed to be easily assembled and disassembled ] components, or with frame joints - eg butt joints, halving joints, mortice-and-tenon, dovetail, and box joints. Joints in metal can be made with brazing [brazing: joining two metal objects by melting a third metal with a lower melting point between them - fusing the two surfaces or edges together. Originally used brass as the 'filler metal' ], soldering [soldering: joining two metal objects by melting a softer metal with a lower melting point between them - thus fusing the two surfaces or edges together. Soldering is a form of brazing ], welding [welding: joining metals by melting and fusing the adjoining edges or surfaces ] or rivets. Joints in plastics can be made with plastic adhesive, rivets, bolts or machine screws. Most products are made from more than one piece of material, so when the product is assembled or fabricated the pieces need to be joined. Joints can be either permanent or temporary, and there are many different types. Permanent joints are intended to stay put. They may make use of adhesives [adhesives: substances which can bond the surfaces of materials together ], nails, rivets, or one of the heat processes of brazing [brazing: joining two metal objects by melting a third metal with a lower melting point between them - fusing the two surfaces or edges together. Originally used brass as the 'filler metal' ], soldering [soldering: joining two metal objects by melting a softer metal with a lower melting point between them - thus fusing the two surfaces or edges together. Soldering is a form of brazing ] or welding [welding: joining metals by melting and fusing the adjoining edges or surfaces ]. Assembly jigs [jigs: devices for holding parts together while being worked on or assembled ] are often used to hold components in place while they are being joined. For example, the parts of a steel roof frame can be put into the jig and then welded together. Temporary fixings usually involve components with a screw thread [screw thread: the projecting spiral rib of a screw or bolt ], such as screws, nuts and bolts, or one of the many knock down fixings on the market. There are many types of adhesives to suit different materials. When you are choosing the right one for your product you will have to take into consideration the type of material, the strength of the bond required and the environment the product will work in - for example if you are gluing timber for outdoor use, you would not use polyvinyl acetate (PVA), because it is water soluble. Double-sided tape will join almost anything to anything. It is widely used in industry, for example, many parts of aircraft are held together with double-sided tape!	6
Strong, permanent and neat-looking joints in timber are achieved using one of the many types of frame joint - so called because right-angled jointed frames are common in furniture, boxes and many other types of assembly. The simplest frame joint is a butt joint. It is easy to make, but weak. You can strengthen a butt joint by fixing a reinforcing plate over the joint. A butt joint can also be strengthened by gluing dowel into both parts - making a dowelled joint. Dowelled joints are good for joining man-made boards (modified timbers) which might split easily if screwed or nailed. Corner halving joints are stronger than butt joints, as there is more contact for gluing, and the shoulder [shoulder: flat surface at right angles to the projecting part in a joint ] gives extra mechanical strength. Through housing joints are used for shelves. Mortise and tenon joints, though more difficult to cut, are very strong, because of the shoulders. If your joint is close to the end of a piece of wood, use a haunched [haunched: with a reduced projecting part or tenon ] mortise and tenon joint. Dovetail joints are very strong and look good - but are complex and difficult to cut. They are often used in high-quality furniture. Comb or box joints are easier to make - especially by machine - and offer good contact for gluing. They are often used in wooden boxes. When pieces of wood are joined along their edges, the joint may need to be supported in some way to reinforce or make it look neater. Sometimes a strip of wood is glued or pinned over the joint, called lipping. Sometimes - eg with floorboards or timber cladding - a thin strip projecting from one edge slots into a slot in the other edge. This is called a tongue and groove joint.	6
As with wood, there are many ways of joining metal permanently. The method used will depend on the function of the product, the strength needed and the quality of the product. Brazing is a way of bonding materials (usually metals) by melting a filler metal or alloy between the components you want to join. The filler metals used in brazing usually have melting points between 450Â°C and 1000Â°C, but must have a lower melting point than the material being joined. Brazing forms very strong, permanent joints. Soldering is a type of brazing which works at lower temperatures. Soft soldering is used to make permanent joints between copper, brass, tinplate or light steelwork, and is the normal way of joining electronic circuit components. Soft solder melts at about 200Â°C. The solder flows into the heated metal along the joint, distributes itself by capillary action, and grips the two pieces together when it all cools. Hard solder melts at 625Â°C, and is used for stronger joints. Welding is different from soldering in that the two pieces of metal are themselves melted along the joints, fusing together as they cool. In oxy-acetylene welding a very hot flame is used. In electric arc welding a spark is used to heat the metal. In both processes a filler rod may used as well to get a really strong joint. Machine screws are special screws for joining metal components, which unlike wood screws do not have a tapering core (like bolts, but smaller). Machine screws have to go into a pre-drilled hole in the component which is the right size and which has the correct internal thread. Rivets are components used for joining metal (and sometimes plastics and plywood). A hole is drilled through both pieces of work, the rivet placed through it, and its end beaten into a dome. A tool called a rivet set or rivet snap is used to to finish the joint off neatly. Some rivets are countersunk. With most rivets you need to get at both sides of the work to make the joint. Pop rivets enable you to complete the joint while only having access to one side of the work. They are usually used for joining thin sheets together.	6
Hammered rivets are used to join metal, but are sometimes used on products such as kitchen knives, where a wooden or plastic handle may be riveted to the blade. The soft metal shaft of the rivet is passed through a hole drilled in the material to be fixed. Then, while the head is held tightly in place on the other side, the shaft is hammered flat to form a secure joint. Pop rivets were originally designed for use in the aircraft industry but are now used in many different products. They are often used where there is only access to one side of the material - eg fixing to a metal tube.The body of the rivet is inserted into a hole drilled into the material to be fixed, and when the pin is gripped and pulled by a special tool it pulls and expands the body to form a solid joint on both sides of the hole. Hinges, catches and locks Hinges, catches and locks are used on boxes, cabinets and cupboards. There are many different types in all three categories, and they can be used on products made from wood, metal or plastic. They are normally fixed to the product with wood screws or machine screws and nuts. Knock down (KD) fittings are used where something has to be taken apart often, or which is designed for assembly by the user, such as kitchen units or self-assembly furniture. They are often plastic fittings which can be joined with one screw or bolt.	6
The material types used in D&T Resistant Materials are woods, metals, plastics, ceramics and composites. Each of these has its own characteristic working properties such as strength, malleability, conductivity, toughness and durability. You need to be familiar with the different properties of ferrous and non-ferrous metals; softwood and hardwood timbers; and thermoplastics and thermoset plastics. When working with resistant materials you need to be able to choose the best material for a job. Wood, metal and plastics are the most common materials used, followed by composites [composites: a complex material made of two or more distinct substances ] and ceramics. The main classification of materials is given in the chart below. You need to know these terms and their definitions. Plasics are divided into thermoset plastics and thermoplastics. The main difference between the two is that thermoplastics can be heated and shaped many times, while thermoset plastics can only be heated and shaped once. Composite materials are formed by combining and bonding two or more materials - a reinforcing material and a bonding agent such as glue. MDF [MDF: Medium-density fibreboard - a type of engineered wood made of compressed wood and fibre particles held together with glue ] and GRP [GRP: Glass-reinforced plastic - a strong and versatile material made by combining a plastic (usually polyester resin) with fibres made of glass ] are examples of composite materials. NB alloys [alloys: mixtures of two or more metals, or of a metal with a non-metal such as carbon. ] are not composite materials. Metals can be either ferrous or non-ferrous. Ferrous metals contain iron while non-ferrous metals do not. Both ferrous and non-ferrous metals are divided into pure metals and alloys. A pure metal is an element - eg iron, copper, gold - unalloyed (not mixed) with another substance. An alloy is a mixture of two or more elements (eg, iron and carbon) to make another metal with particular properties (eg steel). Ceramics are made from clay, sand and feldspar [feldspar: a very common group of hard, crystalline minerals containing silicon ]. These materials are ground to a fine powder, mixed together and fired at high temperatures (700 - 2000Â°C) in the production process. Timbers are divided into hardwood timbers and softwood timbers. Hardwood timbers get their name because of their cellular structure when seen under a microscope - not because they are hard to cut.Softwoods do not have this same hard cellular structure.	6

Hardwood timbers get their name because of their cellular structure when seen under a microscope - not because they are hard to cut.Softwoods do not have this same hard cellular structure. The ability of a material to conduct heat or electrical energy. The ability of a material to withstand a force without breaking or bending. The ability of a material to bend and then to return to its orginal shape and size. The ability of a material to permanently change in shape. The ability of a material to permanently deform [deform: lose or change its shape ] in all directions without cracking. Ferrous metals contain iron. Examples are cast iron, mild steel, medium carbon steel, high carbon steel, stainless steel, and high speed steel. There are two types of timber: softwood and hardwood. Softwood timbers usually come from coniferous trees - that is, evergreen, needle-leaved, cone-bearing trees such as fir and pine. They do not have the hard cell structure that gives hardwood trees their name. Hardwood timbers come from broad-leaved, deciduous trees, and are more important in Design and Technology than softwood timbers. The main hardwood timbers are ash, beech, birch, cherry, elm, iroko, mahogany, meranti, oak, obeche, sapele and teak. Thermoplastics can be heated and shaped many times. Some common thermoplastics are ABS (acrylonitrile butadienestyrene), Nylon (polyamide), acrylic (polymethyl methacrylate), uPVC (polyvinyl chloride), polystyrene, polypropylene and cellulose acetate. Thermoset plastics can only be heated and shaped once. The main thermoset plastics are epoxy resin, melamine formaldehyde, polyester resin and urea formaldehyde.	6
Shaping by wasting simply means cutting away material to leave the desired shape. It gets its name because the material which is removed, such as shavings or sawdust, is usually thrown away. Shaping by wasting can be done on any type of material. Almost any wasting technique can be mechanised. For health and safety reasons, some of these processes should only be done by a teacher. Shaping machines may also be controlled by computers - an example of computer-aided manufacturing [computer-aided manufacturing: use of computers to assist in any of the phases of manufacturing a product. CAM for short ]. Computer control means the work is more accurate and the task can be more frequently and quickly repeated without any deviation from the standard.	6
Deforming is a method of shaping materials by either bending in a straight line or by creating a bowl or dish shape. Metals can be bent in a vice or in folding bars. Thin metal may be bent whilst cold, while thicker metal may need heating or annealing [annealing: heating a metal to toughen it, so it will not break when bent. Some metals like copper will go red when hot. With those that don't glow like aluminium, put soap on them first, it will be hot enough when the soap goes black. ]. Larger pieces of metal may also need to be heated first. The material is marked where it is to be bent, and clamped to the line in the vice or folding bars. To prevent damaging the material as you hit it with the mallet, place a piece of wood next to it and hit that instead. Wood is usually bent by laminating. This is done by cutting thin strips of wood, putting glue on the strips and clamping them into a mould [mould: a hollow form into which a softened material is placed. The material hardens and the mould is then removed to produce a product of the desired shape ]. Hollowing and press moulding are both ways of three-dimensional deforming it is important to remember that wood will not deform in three dimensions. Hollowing is a way of deforming thin sheet metal to produce a bowl shape. The metal is first annealed [annealed: (of metals) heated to make it tougher ] then cooled in cold water. Next it is placed on a leather sand bag and shaped using a bossing mallet. Finally it is placed on a hollowed wooden block and shaped it with a blocking hammer. Press moulding can be used to force sheet metal into 3D shapes. The metal is placed between two moulds which are then squeezed together until the metal takes on the shape of the moulds.	6
Thermoplastics cannot be bent when cold. They are bent using a strip heater or line bender which will heat the plastic in a straight line, so it can be bent by hand, as shown below. Sheet of thermoplastic held in a strip heater. Heater bars heat the thermoplastic in a straight line, prior to bending. A mould is made in two halves - top and bottom. Sheet plastic is placed between the two halves, which are then heated and pressure applied. The heat from the mould causes a chemical reaction in the plastic which enables it to assume the new shape. Press moulding is used to make electrical fittings, handles, and many other products. It can only be used with thermosetting plastics [thermosetting plastics: types of plastic that can only be melted once, and then become very hard ] such as phenol and melamine formaldehyde. Blow moulding is used to shape plastics - mainly for making bottles, plastic buckets and similar shapes. A tube of softened plastic called a parison is extruded [extruded: shaped by being forced through an opening ] into a mould, which then clamps one end closed. Air is then blown under pressure into the interior of the parison, which expands to fill the mould and create the desired shape. PVC, polythene and polypropylene are commonly used in blow-moulding. This process uses a wooden mould [mould: a hollow form into which a softened material is placed. The material hardens and the mould is then removed to produce a product of the desired shape ] or formform: A style of poem, with a particular pattern of rhythm, rhyme pattern or regular line length (eg sonnet, couplets or ballad).. A sheet of thermoplastic is heated, then shaped by creating a vacuum [vacuum: A volume that contains no matter - space is almost a vacuum. ] underneath it. Air pressure then forces the plastic over the mould. Vacuum forming is used to for food and confectionary packaging, trays, shop fittings and baths. Suitable thermoplastics include acrylic, polystyrene and PVC.	6
Reforming is a method of shaping materials which changes their overall appearance by first melting or softening them into a paste, then hardening them. Reforming methods include casting, extrusion and injection moulding. Most metals can be cast, but in school usually only aluminium is used. Die casting uses a metal mould which can be very detailed. The mould is made in two parts to allow the casting to be removed. Die casting is a very important industrial process used for many different types of products. Die-cast aluminium engine parts Â Â Â Injection-moulded plastic hardhat. Extrusion is used to produce long, but fairly thin products such as pipes or curtain tracks. Both plastics and metal can be extruded. The material is forced through a die, which contains a hole which is the same shape as the required product. Injection moulding is a similar process to die casting. A metal mould is used and softened or molten plastic is forced into the mould by pressure from a screw thread or pneumatic plunger. The mould is made in two parts to allow the moulding to be removed. Polythene, polystyrene, polypropylene and nylon are the plastics most often used in injection moulding, which is used extensively in industry.	6
Use charts to plan out the use of your time, and the stages in the making of the product. There are several different types of planning chart. Gantt charts show the tasks involved in making a product, with any overlaps between different tasks. They are useful for planning complex projects. Drawing up a Gantt chart can help you to order the different tasks, and the people doing them, in the most efficient possible way. Gantt charts usually use colour to indicate separate tasks or workflows. Flowcharts describe a sequence of operations. All flowcharts use the same symbols, linked with arrows to show direction of the flow. Flowcharts have many uses in Design and Technology. The flow chart below shows the system for making a cup of tea. Note the shape of the boxes - the start and finish are rectangular with rounded corners, the process boxes are rectangular with square corners, the decision box is a diamond and all boxes are joined by arrows showing the direction of flow. Sequence diagrams show the process of making in words and pictures. They are useful if you need to tell someone else how to do a job or how to use something.	6
Sucessful designs: Apple iPod and Dyson vacuum cleaner What makes a design successful? How do you judge a design? There are a wide range of methods and strategies for analysing and evaluating designs. A product's unique characteristics and features are called the product specification [specification: a statement that tells the designer exactly what the product has to do and what the design requirements are. ]. You need to be able to identify these and compare them with the specification of other similar products. This will help you to evaluate how successful a product's design has been.	6
Quality control or QC is a way of controlling a manufacturing system. It is accomplished by a series of checks and inspections throughout the design and making of the product to ensure it is being made to specification and to the required standard. The results of the quality control checks are then fedback into the system to rectify any shortcomings. Quality control is also sometimes known as quality assurance or QA. The criteria you might use for checking the quality of a circuit board are listed below. As a systems and control designer you need to be able to devise and apply test procedures to check the quality of your work, as well as identify critical stages of the manufacture for quality checks.	6
Electronic components can be divided into two groups,Discrete electronic components and Integrated circuits (ICs). These are separate components that you can combine together to make a circuit on a breadboard, printed circuit board or veroboard (discrete means separate). Examples are resistors [resistors: components which resists or 'slows down' the current in a circuit by acting against the flow of electrons. Resistance is measured in ohms. ], transistors [transistors: components which do not conduct electricity, unless they are turned on by a (different) electrical current. This means they can be used as switches, amplifiers and in other ways. ], capacitors [capacitors: circuit components which store and discharge electrical current. It is made from two parallel metal plates separated by an insulator (called a dielectric). ], relays [relays: type of switch which which uses an electromagnetic coil to connect two or more contacts, which close when the coil is energised. Use of relays enables a very small voltage in the relay circuit to control a much larger one in a separate circuit. ] and light emitting diodes or LEDs [LEDs: stands for Light-Emitting Diodes. LEDs glow when current passes through them. ]. These components are called discrete because you can select them individually and combine them to make up the circuit you require. Discrete components can also be used as external components of an integrated circuit system. For example a 555 astable [astable: (a circuit) having two states, neither of which is stable. An astable circuit therefore oscillates between the two states, giving a constant on/off digital output. Used, for example, to make LEDs flash continuously. ] integrated circuit requires two discrete resistors and a discrete capacitor to make it work. These are miniature circuits incorporating large numbers of components, all etched on to a piece of silicon or chip. These chips are encapsulated inside a protective plastic package, and nowadays are manufactured in vast numbers. The circuits inside the package are arranged in different configurations for particular purposes, for building circuits in schools the DIL package is used, it is big enough to handle. To save space on commercial products surface mount chips are used. A Surface Mount package integrated circuit - far smaller than a finger-tip You don't need to understand how the circuit inside a silicon chip works - there's some quite complicated physics involved. Input-output process block When using ICs you need to know which pins need to be connected, the function of each pin and how the IC is connected to the power supply. A circuit diagram that includes one or more ICs should show the pin numbers and how the pins are connected to the rest of the circuit.	6
"Many electronic devices on the market, such as those in the photo below, are now designed using components that can be programmed [programmed: instructed to perform a function or set of functions ] to function in different ways. The advantage is that the same key component used in one product can also be used in something completely different. This reduces costs, as expensive customised integrated circuits do not need to be designed and manufactured for every new product. A microprocessormicroprocessor: an integrated circuit that contains all or most of the individual elements of a central processing unit (CPU) is a multi-function programmable device. Microprocessors enable computers to work, and they can also be used to control many types of electronic system. An alternative type of programmable component is the microcontroller or PIC [PIC: Programmable Interface Controller - a device which can be programmed via a computer to control complex circuits. ]. Microcontrollers are essentially single-purpose microprocessors, and they enable designers to use the same device to control a wide range of situations, while being cheaper than a computer control system. The rate at which the PIC works is controlled by an internal clock [clock: a pulsed ""clock"" signal is used to determine how fast a microcontroller (such as a microprocessor in a computer) processes a programme. ]. For example, the various systems in a car, including the one pictured below, could be controlled either by a single microprocessor controlling a number of different functions at once, or by a series of microcontrollers, each controlling specific functions such as fuel consumption. The advantage of the microprocessor is that one device can control everything. The disadvantage comes if the microprocessor malfunctions: all the systems could be affected and the replacement cost is high. With microcontrollers, on the other hand, if one is damaged it can be easily replaced and when one fails the others continue to function."	6
In electronic systems, many components work together in circuits [circuits: closed loops through which current flows - from a power source, through a series of components, and back again ]. The photo shows a printed circuit board with components on the uper side connected by copper wires on the underside of the board.. Rather than drawing the components as they look in real life, symbols are used to produce circuit diagrams or schematics, showing the components and connections between them. These symbols are recognised universally around the world and avoid confusion between components which look similar. The diagram below shows a 555 astable circuit with components and the standard symbols for each of them. On the next page is a table of the standard component symbols you need to know.	6
The input is what sets an electrical circuit in action. The output is what results from an electrical circuit. Logic gates are a family of digital devices which compare two or more inputs and give a specific output. Each logic gate (NOT, AND, NAND, OR, NOR etc) acts in a different way, and will always act so. The action of any logic gate is shown by a Truth Table, eg the AND gate will only give a high output, when all the inputs are high. Some more common symbols are shown in the diagram below, including output components and logic gates.	6
Integrated circuits (ICs) are complex, highly-miniaturised circuits, incorporating hundreds or even thousands of components, etched on to a tiny piece of silicon - a chip. The 555 timer IC, shown in the diagram below, has many functions. Two of them are: monostable and astable circuits. Pin-out diagram for a 555 timer chip A 555 monostable timer is usually, unless a circuit turns it on by applying a voltage to pin 2. When the voltage at pin 2 goes above a level the 555's output will go high, but only for one pulse, after which the 555 will return to the low stable state. So this type of circuit is used where a single, timed output is required, either as an on-for-a-period or as a timed delay. In the diagram below, the length of the time period - ie how long the output is on for - is determined by a resistor/capacitor network (RC network [RC network: stands for Resistor/Capacitor network - a combination of resistors and capacitors that are used to control a circuit, such as a timer. The resistor 'slows-down' the current, charging the capacitor. If the value of either component increased, the time period will also increase. ]), which is connected to pins 6 and 7. The RC network is a combination of resistors [resistors: components which resists or 'slows down' the current in a circuit by acting against the flow of electrons. Resistance is measured in ohms. ] and capacitors [capacitors: circuit components which store and discharge electrical current. It is made from two parallel metal plates separated by an insulator (called a dielectric). ] used to control this time period. The resistor 'slows-down' the current, which charges the capacitor. In an astable timer the output is not stable in either the on or the off state, but instead is pulsed on and off continuously. The frequency (number of pulses per second) is determined by the RC network [RC network: stands for Resistor/Capacitor network - a combination of resistors and capacitors that are used to control a circuit, such as a timer. The resistor 'slows-down' the current, charging the capacitor. If the value of either component increased, the time period will also increase. ] connected to the 555 timer. When connected to an LED an astable timer gives a continuously flashing light. When set to a very high frequency and connected to a loudspeaker it will generate a tone.	6
The operational amplifier or Op-Amp amplifies [amplifies: changes a small input current or voltage into a larger output current or voltage ] the difference between the two inputs to produce a voltage gain [voltage gain: the amount of amplification of the input voltage - ie how much bigger the output voltage is compared to the input voltage. ] as high as 100,000 times the difference. The output voltage cannot be any greater than the power-supply voltages. It cannot output a voltage more than two volts above or below its power connections. If the power supply is + 12 and -12 volts the maximum values at the output are likely to be +10 and -10 volts. An estimate of 85% of the supply may also be used. The diagram below shows the pin set-up of an Op-Amp. The circuit below is a typical application using the 741 Op-Amp. Can you identify the inputs and the outputs?	6
Information and communication technology (ICT) is an essential tool in designing and manufacturing products. There are three key areas of ICT in the designing and making process: modelling and simulation, computer-aided design, and computer-aided manufacture. Electronic circuits can be modelled in real life using a prototyping [prototyping: making one-off working models to find out if an idea works. ] board - also known as a breadboard [breadboard: a prototype circuit made from a plastic board with holes in which the components are inserted, linked by conductor traces on the underside. Also called a veroboard. ]. However, this can be time consuming and uses real components, which can be damaged. Computerised simulation software can be used to test circuits without the need to physically build them. In addition, the computer simulation can be saved and edited. Simulationsimulation: the artificial recreation of an event or activity, eg flight simulation software software can also be used to simulate control programmes for programmable interface controllers (PIC [PIC: Programmable Interface Controller - a device which can be programmed via a computer to control complex circuits. ]s). Typically, flowchart symbols can be placed or dragged on-screen. The action will be simulated to ensure that they operate as intended.	6
When a circuit has been finalised, a printed circuit board is usually designed and manufactured. Specialist software can be used to plan where the tracks, pads, strain holes and mounting holes will be on the PCB [PCB: Printed Circuit Board ]. The diagram below shows a PCB which has been designed using CAD. CAD software can also be used to design the structure or housing of control systems. Software can also be used for writing the program used in microcontrollers. It is written in programme-editing software before being downloaded onto the chip.	6

A class 3 lever does not have the mechanical advantage of class-one levers and class-two levers, so examples are less common. The effort and the load are both on the same side of the fulcrum, but the effort is closer to the fulcrum than the load, so more force is put in the effort than is applied to the load. These levers are good for grabbing something small, fiddly or dirty, or picking up something that could be squashed or broken if too much pressure is applied. The common example of class 3 levers is a pair of barbeque tongs or a pair of tweezers. The latter are shown in the diagram below. Learn the position of load, effort and fulcrum for each class of lever. Linking it to a practical example will help you to remember them.	6
"Linkages are mechanisms which allow force or motion to be directed where it is needed. A linkage consists of a system of rods or other rigid materials connected by joints or pivots. The ability of each rod to move will be limited by moving and fixed pivots. The input at one end of the mechanical linkages will be different from the output, in place, speed, direction and other ways. A reverse-motion linkage changes the direction of motion. In the diagram below, note how the linkage looks a little like a ""Z"". See how the central rod moves around a central fixed pivot. By pulling (or pushing) the linkage in one direction, it creates an exact opposite motion in the other direction. If the fixed pivot was not central, it would create a larger or smaller motion in the opposite direction. A parallel-motion linkage creates an identical parallel motion. In the diagram below, note how the linkage looks a little like an ""n"". This time, it is the two side rods that move around two central fixed pivots, while the top of the ""n"" moves freely. By pulling (or pushing) the linkage in one direction, it creates an identical parallel motion at the other end of the linkage. A bell-crank linkage changes the direction of movement through 90Â°. A bell-crank linkage tends to look a little like an ""L"" or, as shown in the diagram below, a mirror image of an ""L"". By pulling (or pushing) the linkage in one direction, it creates a similar motion at the other end of the linkage. For example, a bell-crank linkage could be used to turn a vertical movement into horizontal movement, as in a bicycle braking system. A treadle linkage shows how linkages can be used to change one type of motion into another. In this case, the rotary motion of the cam moves a parallel-motion linkage. The parallel-motion linkage controls the identical side-to-side, or oscillating motion, of two windscreen wipers."	6
A cam is a shaped piece of metal or plastic fixed to a rotating shaft. A cam mechanism has three parts: cam, slide and follower. The cam shaft rotates continually, turning the cam. The follower is a rod that rests on the edge of the turning cam. The follower's pattern of movement depends on the profile or outside edge of the cam that it follows. If the cam is perfectly round and the fixed shaft is in the centre of the cam, the follower will dwell. But if the cam is a different shape, and/or the shaft is not central, the follower will rise or fall. How often and how quickly the follower moves is determined by the shape of the cam and the position of the shaft. The pear shape of this cam means that for half the cycle, the follower will dwell. Then, as the pointed part of the cam approaches, the follower is pushed up (rises), then, as the point passes, falls and dwells - and the cycle starts again. The eccentric cam is perfectly circular, but the rotating shaft is off-centre, which affects how it turns. This type of cam produces a smooth, symmetrical rise and fall motion in the follower, which never pauses to dwell. With a drop cam the shaft is central in a perfectly round cam, which has a chunk removed. The follower will dwell for most of the cycle, until it suddenly falls into the removed section, then rises again as the cam regains its circular shape. Note that if the size of the cut-out portion was larger or the incline smoother, the follower would behave differently.	6
Where very large speed reductions are required, several pairs of gears can be used in a compound gear train. A small gear drives a large gear. The large gear has a smaller gear on the same shaft. This smaller gear drives a large gear. With each transfer, the speed is significantly reduced. Another method of making large speed reductions is to use a worm gear. This is a shaft with a thread like a screw. This connects at 90Â° to a large gear (the thread shaft points along the outside edge of the larger gear). Each time the shaft spins one revolution, the gear turns forward by only one tooth. If the gear has 50 teeth, this creates a gear ratio of 50:1. The worm can drive the worm gear round, but the worm gear cannot drive the worm. This means that worm gears are good to use in hoists, the load will not fall back when the motor stops. Worm gears are a good option when you wish to alter direction or rotary motion through 90Â° and reduce the speed. The photograph to the left shows a worm gear powered by a motor. Bevel gears, like worm gears, change the axis of rotation through 90Â°. The teeth have been specially cut so the gears will mesh at right-angles to each other, where spur gears must be parallel. A pinion is a round cog and the rack is a flat bar with teeth. The driver cog either moves along the rack, as in a rack and pinion (funicular) railway - or else the driver cog moves the rack, as in the steering system in cars. Rack and pinion changes rotary motion into linear motion - as shown in the diagram below.	6
Pneumatic systems use the energy stored in compressed air to do work. By controlling the release of the air to pneumatic cylinders, we can turn that energy into movement. Pneumatic components are arranged in circuits - much like electronic circuits - using symbols for each component. You need to be familiar with the operation of two of most common pneumatic components - a single-acting cylinder with a three-port valve, and a double-acting cylinder with a five-port valve. You also need to understand how time-delayed pneumatic circuits and pneumatic logic circuits work. Finally you need to know how to work out the force output from a cylinder. In your exam, you will be asked to draw pneumatic circuit diagrams using symbols. The symbols for each of the common pneumatic components are listed below. You need to be able to recognse these symbols, and understand the function of the components they stand for. You might find it helpful to print off this page and keep it for reference. Remember that any of the valve operators (for example, push-button operation; plunger operation) can be used with the three-port valves or five-port valves. It is important to choose the one that matches the system requirements and add them to the top and bottom of the valve symbol.	6
Pneumatic logic circuits are more complex circuits controlled by more than one valve, either in series (AND circuits) or in parallel (OR circuits). Pneumatic logic circuits work in a similar way to logic circuits in electronics, with pneumatic valves instead of electronic switches. Logic circuits are often used to make pneumatic systems safe. For example some pneumatic drills will not work unless a guard is in place. The drill requires two switches to be operated in order to work: the first by putting the guard in place, the second by pressing start. An AND circuit has two valves in series. In the diagram below, both three-port valve A and three-port valve B have to be pressed before the piston in the single-acting cylinder will outstroke. Valve B will have no air supply unless valve A is open. Valve B controls the air supply to the single-acting cylinder. AND circuit - two valves in series An OR circuit has two valves in parallel. The single acting cylinder will go positive if valve A OR valve B OR both of them are pressed. The shuttle valve provides the OR control. A T-piece may appear to do a similar job, but a T-piece would allow air to escape out of the exhaust port of the 3/2 that was not pressed. OR circuit - two valves in parallel It helps to think of valves as switches (as in electronics). Valves may be operated by different actuators (controls), for example push button, lever or roller trip, but they do the same thing: simply switch the output air on or off.	6
The competitive nature of the manufacturing industry means that companies are constantly looking for ways to increase the efficiency and productivity [productivity: the amount of output achieved for every unit of input used. A productive manufacturing system will produce consistently high quality products with the minimum of wasted time, money or effort ] of their systems. Three of the most important ways companies can achieve this are by using standard components, modular systems, and different production methods. It is common practice in modern manufacturing for the production of the components that make up a product to be outsourced [outsourced: contracted-out to another manufacturer/provider - usually because this is cheaper than keeping the job inhouse. ] to other companies. For example, modern headlights for cars are usually built as a whole unit, rather than an individual lens and reflector. The light shown in the picture below could easily be built in France and shipped to the UK to be assembled into a vehicle. The advantage with using standard components is that it speeds up manufacturing and reduces manufacturing and maintenance costs, as the same units can be purchased and used all around the world.	6
As the electronics used in products have become more complex, many manufacturers have adopted a modular [modular: using standardized units or dimensions ] approach to control systems [control systems: systems which control the behaviour of other systems. ]. The picture below shows a stacked printed circuit board (PCB). The bottom board is a standard Programmable Interface Controller (PIC [PIC: Programmable Interface Controller - a device which can be programmed via a computer to control complex circuits. ]) board. The top board is an input / output board. This system could either use a ready-made or a customised input / output board. In either situation, the standard features make the system more universal than a completely custom-made PCB. In the stacked PCB [PCB: Printed Circuit Board ] system shown above there are a number of standard components - such as the hexagonal spacers and machine screws used to mount and stack the boards. Try to identify the other standard components in the picture.	6
There are three main production methods used in manufacturing: one-off, batch and mass production. Sometimes known as job or custom production, this is where a single item is required - for example a suspension bridge or a custom-made engine for a racing car. The unit cost is high for this method, as the production system needs to be changed for each different unit. This occurs where quantities of an item are sold regularly - for example a local baker producing many batches of specialist loaves each day for sale in local shops. Batch production will involve producing and storing the components which will make up the end product, eg the batch production of PCBs [PCB: Printed Circuit Board ]. Products that sell in high volume, nationally or internationally, are manufactured on production or assembly lines. The initial set-up cost (or capital investment) of mass production is high, due to the specialist equipment used - but the cost is spread across a very large number of products, so the unit cost [unit cost: the cost per item manufactured ] is low. When a mass-production line runs continuously round the clock, it is called continuous flow.	6

Every design is influenced by outside factors such as consumer demand, the state of the market, client expectations, and consumer laws. Designers need to consider a product's maintenance and disposal requirements - the whole product life-cycle - not just the design and making phase. And products and innovations may have effects beyond just the individual who buys and uses them - they can impact on society at large or the environment. Health and safety is a key factor in all areas of industry. You need to know what implications it has for both designers and manufacturers Products don't disappear once they're sold - they last for a shorter or longer time, and will need to be maintained and disposed of safely at the end of their life. The designer needs to think about the expected length of life of a product, and about maintenance issues such as ease of replacement of batteries or the level of skill required to replace worn-out components - because all these things influence the design process. The people or organisations who purchase and use a product are called end-users or consumers. Without consumers who want a product and are prepared to buy it, there's not much point in designing or making it. So consumer demand - what consumers want or need in a product - is a key influence on product design. Moreover, consumers want to have a wide choice of products, so they can find one that suits their individual requirements. Consumers have a lot of power. They have organisations to represent their interests - eg, The Consumers' Association and specialist organisations such as the Electricity Consumers' Council. They also have rights, enshrined in law, which give them a means of hitting back if necessary against those who have sold them wrongly-described or faulty goods. Enough said! Designers usually work for someone who pays them to solve a design problem. This is the client - and it is usually the client (an individual or a company) who gives the designer a design brief [design brief: a set of instructions given to a designer by a client. ], and turns his or her ideas into products for consumers in the market place. Since the client is paying, their wishes are also a key influence on product design. For example, the designers of the O2 arena, in London, the Richard Rogers Partnership, were working for the British government, which was their client. Note that the client is different from the user, who in this example was the general public (you and I). In the designing and building the Richard Rogers Partnership would have employed specialists, such as construction companies, thus becoming clients themselves.	6
Most designers will feel that they have a responsibility to make products that do not have too damaging an impact on the environment. Seeking to minimise negative effects on the environment in this way is called a sustainable approach, because it does not damage the livelihood of future generations. A designer may also want to think about the impact his or her products might have on people's religious or cultural susceptibilities. Certain images and slogans have the power to deeply shock or offend people, which will probably not encourage them to buy the product! There may also be legal constraints on the designer, as well as purely moral ones. For example the The Data Protection Act protects the consumer by limiting the access that other individuals or organisations have to private information about them, as well as the ways in which this information can be used. Companies are required to work to guidelines on how information is processed, recorded and stored. Limitations are also placed on the length of time data should be kept and how it is shared.	6
Protective clothing minimizes the risk of injury during the manufacture of products. Health and safety is a key factor in all areas of industry. Manufacturers are expected to ensure that both employees (makers) and customers (end users) are safe. They must put procedures in place to ensure safe working practices and that products will meet the safety standards in each country where they are sold. Manufacturers are required to identify and assess all potential risks in the manufacturing environment. This is called risk assessment. It affects product manufacturing, choice and use of components, tools, equipment and work. Once a risk or hazard has been identified, safe working practices are implemented, for example the use of eye protection where there is a potential risk.	6
Where a risk cannot be reasonably avoided by safety procedures and safe working practices, control systems are used to increase safety. For example, when working with machine tools [machine tools: 'heavy' machinery which is powered by mains electricity - eg pillar drills, lathes etc. ], the working area where mechanisms are exposed must be protected by a moveable guard. Many machine tools have a microswitch attached to the guard which isolates the power when the guard is up (exposing the mechanism). Emergency stop or cut-out buttons are generally located around a workshop to isolate the power supply to all, or a section of, machines - as illustrated in the picture. Look at the lathe below and try to identify the safety features. Then press play to see if you spotted them all.	6

"Flowcharts are used to design and plan control systems. All flowcharts use the same symbols, linked with arrows to show direction of the flow. Flowcharts start and end with the oval 'start' and 'end' symbols. Inputs and outputs are shown as parallelograms and processes as rectangles. Sometimes the process box links to a sub-routine [sub-routine: a section of a programme that is not part of the main set of commands. ] - another flowchart with more detailed steps, which then feeds back into the main process. The diamond shape is a ""decision box"", which checks an input or condition before carrying on. The diagram below shows the main flowchart symbols and how they are used in a system flowchart. Exam Tip: Flowcharts can also be used to plan systems. Choose an everyday activity or system that you are familiar with, and describe it using the symbols in the diagram above."	6
Systems need to be controlled, to ensure that the system's output continues to be the one we want. Digital control systems use a sequence of instructions called a programme. In an examination you may be asked to plan a control programme for a given situation, using a flowchart. Flowcharts use symbols to show the sequence of actions in a programme. On page two we listed the main symbols in a system flowchart. The flowchart diagram below illustrates a simple programme to control an automatic vehicle barrier at a car park.	6
Quality assurance (QA) is a system of checks designed to ensure that fault-free products are produced that can be sold at a profit to satisfied customers. A quality-assurance system involves regular quality control [Quality Control: the checks made during manufacture to ensure that a product is being made to the appropriate standard. ] inspections which test and monitor the quality, accuracy and fitness-for-purpose of the product, from the design stage through to manufacture. Quality-control checks take place at critical control points [critical control points: the predefined points in a manufacture system where quality control checks take place. ] (CCPs) in a product's manufacture. The following are typical CCPs in textiles manufacture.	6
Consumers are influenced by a number of societal, cultural and moral factors, and textiles designers use market research to find out about the wants and needs of their target market. Consumers have rights in law, and you need to know what these are. Textiles products need to be maintained, and manufacturers use standard symbols to show consumers how to do this. Health and safety are important to textiles designers and manufacturers, as all products must conform to safety standards to ensure they are safe to make and safe to use. Designers have to think carefully about the needs and wants of their target market, and investigating what consumers value and desire in a product is called market researchmarket research: Market research is the gathering of data or information concerning consumer opinions about a product or service.

Consumer reaction against 'corporate' trends Worries about pollution of rivers and beaches from textile processes.

Designers and manufacturers must identify and reduce any possible hazards [hazards: anything likely to cause harm and/or damage ] in manufacture so products are safe for consumers to use. Products that may cause a hazard, such as a fire risk [risk: the chance or probability that a hazard actually will cause harm or damage. ], must carry labels with flammability [flammability: The extent to which something burns with a flame. ] warnings. In the case of some textile products (eg those used in extreme sports) fitness-for-purpose and quality of manufacture can be a matter of life or death. The other aspect of safety you need to know about is the law covering the health and safety of those working in textiles production. The most important piece of legislation is the The Health and Safety at Work Act (1974). The Act makes it a legal requirement for manufacturers to undertake a risk assessment of all the stages of product manufacture, to ensure the safety of workers and prevent industrial accidents. The Act specifies that	6

A care label on a textile product gives the consumer useful information about product maintenance. All manufacturers use similar symbols to tell you how to look after your product. The graphic shows these symbols. Exam questions about care symbols are popular. Make sure that you can use the standard care label symbols to explain the aftercare for products made from natural and synthetic fibres.

Textile materials are joined by stitching, fusing or heat-sealing. Stitching two fabrics together produces an unfinished seam. Finishing the seam prevents fraying and produces a hard-wearing, neat finish. Fusing is used to permanently join two fabrics together using an adhesive [adhesive: a substance which bonds the surfaces of materials together ] resin. Fusing is sometimes done by hand, sometimes by machine. In industry a range of different sewing machines are used for stitching seams, embroidery, buttonholes etc.	6
Industrial practices are designed to ensure that quality products are manufactured efficiently at a profit. They involve designers working together with clients and manufacturers - all of whom need to keep the needs of the consumer in min All production systems consist of inputs, processes and outputs, and there will usually be feedbacks and subsystems as well.d. Production methods vary according to the scale and type of textile being produced and range from one-off to mass production, but they all need production plans and a work schedule. ICT and computer-aided manufacturing (CAM) play a vital role in modern textiles production. Industrial practices are the designing and manufacturing processes used by manufacturers to ensure that products are made efficiently and at a profit for satisfied consumers. Industrial practices bring together a number of different people and roles, and you need to understand what each of them does and how they relate to each other. The client's role is to identify the need for a product (perhaps commissioning some market researchmarket research: Market research is the gathering of data or information concerning consumer opinions about a product or service), drawing up a design brief [design brief: a set of instructions given to a designer by a client. ] for the designer, setting production deadlines and the price of the product. The client is usually a manufacturer or retailer. The designer's role is to agree the design brief, and then research market trends, fabrics and processes - taking into account any relevant societal, cultural, moral or safety issues to ensure the product is right. The designer will work on a design specification [design specification: document containing details of a product's required characteristics, and all the processes, materials and other information needed to design the product ], produce a costing for the product, and help plan the product's manufacture. The manufacturer's role is to look any models or prototypes [prototypes: one-off working models of a product to find out if the idea works. ] made by the designer, and work out the most efficient way of manufacturing the product. They will then produce a production plan and a work schedule [work schedule: a written breakdown of the processes needed to manufacture a product. ]. During manufacture their aim will be to keep material and labour costs down, while producing a high-quality, safe product on schedule in a safe environment. The user or consumer's role is to demand a high-quality, value-for-money product, which meets their requirements, is enjoyable to wear, and is safe. Oh yes - and to pay for it when it comes to market.	6
All production systems consist of inputs, processes and outputs. Usually there is a feedback loop as well, to enable the inputs and processes to be modified as a result of quality control checks or feedback from customers. Production systems can be modelled with a system diagram like the one below. In a production system, a number of different designing and manufacturing processes or sub-systems take place at the same time. Some of these sub-systems take place in turn - lay-planning usually takes place before costing, for example - while others will overlap. The entire processing depends on each of these processes being completed correctly, so if one goes wrong the whole system may break down and production may be held up. Clearly complex production systems need to be controlled, and in textile manufacturing systems control can be carried out with the help of mechanical, electric, electronic or computer control devices.	6
ICT and CAM play a vital role in modern textiles production. Computer-aided manufacturing involves the use of CNC [CNC: stands for Computer Numerical Control - the use of computers to control cutting and shaping machines. A key CAM (computer-aided manufacturing) technique. ] machines for printing, cutting, joining and many other textiles processes. CNC-automated machines can repeat processes with accuracy and reliability, and are easily re-programmed when changes to design or production run are needed. The graphic shows some of the uses of CNC machines. CIM systems integrate or link CAD and CAM systems. These combined systems link design development, production planning and manufacturing systems together. Companies that use CIM are able to design a product in one country and manufacture it overseas where labour costs are lower.	6
There are two main graphic types - bitmap graphics and vector graphics. It is likely that you'll work with both types of graphics during your project. In this Revision Bite, you will learn about the main differences between the two types of graphics and when you should use them. When you take a photograph using a digital camera, or scan an image from a magazine, you are creating a bitmap graphic. A bitmap graphic is composed of many tiny parts, called pixels, which are often of many different colours. It is possible to edit each individual pixel. Since the computer has to store information about every single pixel [pixel: One of the individual units (often called dots) that make up an image ] in the image, the file size of a bitmap graphic is often quite large. When you resize a bitmap graphic, it tends to lose quality. Use the red slider to zoom into the bitmap graphic below. Notice how as you zoom further in, the image loses quality and you can start to see each individual pixel.	6
It is very likely that you will use a digital camera to capture images for your graphics project. In this Revision Bite, you will learn about the basic functions of a digital camera and the top ten tips for taking photographs. You will need to take a range of pictures using a digital camera. Think about the settings and the images you want. It may sound obvious, but it's an essential aspect of getting the image you want. Before you start work, note down what you want to achieve.	6
Close or tight shots are good for capturing expressions or atmosphere. Think about when you watch a sports match. When you are up close you can see the players sweating and hear the grunts as they immerse themselves in the game, which in turn arouses your interest. This also applies when capturing images, so focus on what you want to show, and eliminate distractions. Photograph taken from a distance of a man talking on a mobile phone, and photo of the same person in close-up As these images illustrate, getting in close allows you to see people's expressions. Always remember when taking photographs of people to get their permission first. To create interesting photographs, you need to fill the frame and minimise the amount of dead space. The first rule is to get in close, and there is no reason why you can't fill the frame with your focal point being taken as an extremely close-up shot. It will help you to capture emotion that wouldn't be detectable from far away. Capturing action shots requires practise. You could practise capturing images of footballers in action, but make sure you have their permission first. Take lots of pictures to see if you can capture a player making contact with the ball. With a digital camera you can take lots of pictures, view them on the LCD display, then delete any unwanted images. Some cameras have a function called continuous mode that allows you to take several photos in quick succession. This is great for taking action shots. These photos were shot in continuous mode. The focal point is the most interesting object/person in your photograph. Any more than one focal point looks cluttered. If your photograph is expansive - for example, a sweeping landscape - you can choose a tree or small cottage as your focal point. Two images of a park - the first has too many focal points - a bench, trees, grass, people; the second has one clear focal point - a tree There are too many focal points (people, trees, bench) in the first image shown above, whereas the second image shows the tree as the clear focal point. Arrange your subjects to ensure you translate what you want the audience to focus on. Use plain backgrounds. Be selective. If your object is in front of a messy background, move it until you are satisfied with the shot. Two photographs of an iron - one with a messy background and one with a plain background In the first image above, the messy background takes the focus away from the iron. Have you ever taken a picture of a landscape and been disappointed when you have not captured the beauty of it? There are several reasons why the camera views something differently from the human eye. We have the ability to interpret an image and enhance it, because the brain has the ability to process lots of different things at a time. The camera has a limited focus range whereas the eye is constantly scanning the scenery, recomposing it, and responding to changes in light conditions. The eyes work in conjunction with the brain to create the splendid image that you can see. A camera has a much narrower exposure range than the human eye. Your role as photographer is to translate what you see and capture an attractive feature following the rules of taking good digital images. Once again, take lots of photos to ensure you capture one that is perfect. Photographs with the focal point exactly in the centre can lack depth and interest, so it's better to position your focal point off-centre. To do this, apply the rule of thirds. Draw two horizontal and two vertical lines through the picture you want to capture, to divide it into thirds. The eyes are naturally drawn to the four focal points illustrated in red above, so place the important elements of your picture on one (or more) of these points. Compare the two images above. A focal point placed in the centre (as in image 1, above) often just looks boring, so as a rule avoid placing your focal point in the centre. You will see this rule being applied in any magazine you look at. Most digital cameras have an automatic flash that is used when the camera senses there isn't enough natural light. It's good to keep the flash on automatic, to make sure your photographs are illuminated well. You need to experiment with your flash, to work out its depth or range. Generally, most flashes work up to 10 metres away - any further, and your subject is likely to appear dark. Also think about natural light, especially outside. Try to make sure the sun/light source is behind you, or focussed on your subjects. When photographing people, be aware that strong bright light will show up their wrinkles and blemishes, so you may need to adjust the light. Similarly, when taking photographs of landscapes, try to take them in the early morning or early evening because the light is softer then. Some scenes lend themselves to vertical shots, so experiment with using your camera horizontally and vertically. A photograph of Nelson's Column, for example, would be ideal for a vertical shot to illustrate the towering effect the coloumn has on its surrounding scenery. Nelson's Column is ideal for a vertical shot. Once you have mastered these rules, you can then begin to break them. With digital photography, it's easy to take lots of pictures, so don't be afraid to experiment. If you can create an unusual image, it's likely that people will be interested in it.	6
It is important that the graphic products you develop appeal to your target audience, and that they convey the right message. To ensure that your products are fit for the audience and purpose, you should use a process known as prototyping and testing. In this section, you will learn about prototyping and testing and discover why it is so important. You will also learn how to choose the best reviewers. A prototype is an initial version of a multimedia product. The prototype is tested to make sure it is fit for the audience and purpose. If there are any errors or problems, the prototype is improved and tested again. This goes on until the product is considered to be fully functional and suitable. This process is known as prototyping and testing and is illustrated in the flow diagram below.	6
Everyday we are surrounded by thousands of graphic products. Some products are appropriate for one audience, but not necessarily another. For example, a graphic that advertises bathroom cleaner is likely to be aimed at adults rather than children. Graphic products usually have a clear purpose - which might be to educate, inform or entertain. For example, the purpose of a poster in a health clinic might be to warn people about the dangers of smoking. If this poster does not get the information across to the audience in an effective and memorable way, it will not have the intended impact on the audience. Prototyping and testing is important because it will show you if your product is suitable for the audience and if your product its serving its purpose. You will need to use reviewers to evaluate your graphic product and give you feedback. The feedback you receive from your reviewers will help you improve your product.	6

It's important to choose reviewers who will give you honest and constructive [constructive: Helpful with the intention of suggesting improvements. ] feedback about your product. It is important to get feedback from a range of potential users. Below are some of the things to consider during the prototyping and testing process.	6
The vector tools are particularly good for drawing shapes and lines. They can also be used to add text to a graphic. To draw a shape, simply select the tool and drag [drag: In computer software, you drag something by selecting it with your mouse, holding down the left mouse button (or the mouse button on a Mac), moving it to the desired place and releasing the button. ] it across the canvas. To add text to a graphic, simply select the text tool, drag it across the canvas and type the text in to the box. To add text, click on the text tool The properties of the shapes and text boxes (such as colours, sizes, font types) can be changed in the properties window.	6
Graphics are visual elements - images, symbols, diagrams etc - used to make printed information more interesting or lively. They are an important method of communication. They can be used to enhance many forms of media, from buttons on webpages to road signs. In this Revision Bite, you will learn about the different types of graphics and their uses. Graphics provide an important way of communicating information and they can be found in many different places. Graphics can be found in newspapers, which are secondary sources of information In books, magazines, newspapers, leaflets, poster and flyers Format, style, colour and size of images will vary depending on the audience the image is aimed at. Also on whether it's in print, on paper (eg a painting or sketch ), or on a screen.	6
The images you create will need to serve a specific purpose and appeal to an identified audience. The nature of the message you are trying to get across will vary. For example, you may want to give the target audience health information, or you might be hoping to sell a product. Because of this, the graphics you use will also vary, depending on whether you want to convey a formalformal: 'Official' or 'standard' English, as opposed to spoken, colloquial or dialect English; stiffly polite. Can also mean 'to do with form'. or informal [informal: A more relaxed and less rigid style. Informal writing is often friendly and can include slang terms. ] tone. The size, position, colour and composition of the image will also differ according to different audiences. Play the activity and match the product to the correct audience. You need to identify the target audience and cater for their needs. A publication for young children might include lots of cartoon images, whereas a publication for adults might include digital photographs. The images, content and style of writing would be very different in both of these publications. Inappropriate use of these elements would make the publications useless for their purpose. Image 1: Bisc-Eats, tasty and yummy, perfect for your tummy! Image 2: A poster to inform people about the risks of meningitis The two publications above serve different purposes. Image 1 uses persuasive text and images to encourage people to buy the product. Image 2 is used to inform the audience, so the tone of the text and images used is quite different. For more information on writing styles, check out the Revision Bites on Language and Tone in the Bitesize English section.	6
You will need to decide which is the most suitable printer to use for your particular graphic. There may be a limit to the printers you can use, depending on the make and model you have access to at home or school. Will you be using a laser printer? Or an ink-jet printer? As a general rule, you should use a laser printer to print documents that contain a lot of text, and an ink-jet printer for images. When you choose to print something from your computer, if you have access to more than one printer, you can select the printer you want by clicking on print, from the file menu. You'll get a printer options box, with a drop-down menu showing the choice of printers, and you click on the one you want. Printing options box showing choice of printers in the drop-down menu	6
The number of pixels in a digital image is known as the image resolution. The resolution is measured in dots per inch (sometimes called pixels per inch). An image with a resolution of 100 dpi [dpi: dots per inch - the measurement of image resolution ] has 100 dots packed into a square inch. The greater the resolution [resolution: The fineness of detail that can be seen in an image - the higher the resolution of an image, the more detail it holds. It is measured in dots per inch (dpi). ], the more detailed the image and the bigger the file size will be. When you are preparing images for print, you should aim to use the highest resolution possible, especially if your prints are large, otherwise the image will appear pixelated [pixelated: A term used to describe when individual pixels are apparent to the naked eye. This usually occurs when the image has not been saved at a high enough resolution or the image is too large. ]. The resolution of the image on the left is 300dpi - ie it has 300 dots packed into one square inch. The image on the right has a resolution of 100dpi - ie it has 100 dots packed into one square inch. The image on the left contains more detail per square inch than the image on the right, therefore it has a bigger file size. When printed, it will be better quality than the image on the right.	6
If your graphics project involves printing out images, there are some important things you should consider, such as resolution and type of printer. In this Revision Bite, you will learn everything you need to know about printing images. When you view a graphic on your computer screen - what you see is what you get (WYSIWYG). However, if you print the graphic out, it may look very different and not how you intended. You will need to decide which is the most suitable printer to use for your particular graphic. There may be a limit to the printers you can use, depending on the make and model you have access to at home or school. Will you be using a laser printer? Or an ink-jet printer? As a general rule, you should use a laser printer to print documents that contain a lot of text, and an ink-jet printer for images.

The resolution of the image on the left is 300dpi - ie it has 300 dots packed into one square inch. The image on the right has a resolution of 100dpi - ie it has 100 dots packed into one square inch. The image on the left contains more detail per square inch than the image on the right, therefore it has a bigger file size. When printed, it will be better quality than the image on the right. To create more realistic images, a good ink-jet printer will use more than five independent colours. If you want to print photographs, it is better to use a colour printer that is specifically designed for producing photo-realistic or photo-quality results. The quality of your printed images will also depend on the paper you use. Plain paper is ideal for printing text, but images might require something else.	6
You might want to use images from books, newspapers or magazines in your graphics project, so you will need to learn how to turn images on paper into digital images on screen. In this Revision Bite, you will learn how to scan images and save them in the right kind of format. Many books, newspapers and magazines contain good images to put in your graphics project. You will need to use a scanner to transfer the images from paper to your screen. A scanner is a device that takes images in printed format and copies them into a computer in a digital format. Once saved to your computer the scanned images can be edited using a graphics package [graphics package: A piece of computer software that allows you to create, edit and manipulate a range of images using different tools within the software. You can also save the images in a range of different formats. ]. This may include altering the colour and contrast of an image to compensate for over- or under-exposure. You can also cut and crop an image to remove any unwanted areas.	6
To get the most out of your scanner, you need to think about the settings you need for each individual image. An image intended for use on the web will require very different settings from one intended for print on a poster. The bit depth determines the number of colours available in the scanned image - ie colour quality. A 1-bit image uses only black and white, whereas a 24-bit image uses more than 16 million colours. To get a true copy of your source image, the bit depth should be set to at least 24-bit - used for high quality print-outs such as posters. An 8-bit image is usually good enough for the web. The resolution [resolution: The fineness of detail that can be seen in an image - the higher the resolution of an image, the more detail it holds. It is measured in dots per inch (dpi). ] of an image is measured in dots per inch (dpi), also known as pixels per inch (ppi). The dpi determines the amount of detail the scanned image can have. If the final image is to be displayed on a computer (web/CD-Rom etc), you should set the scanner to 72-96 dpi. If the final image is in print, then it is usually best to set the dpi to the highest number you can - around 300 dpi. If you wish to enlarge an image to be used on the web or for print, always scan it at the highest dpi you can, and then enlarge the image size in your graphics software (eg Photoshop). You can then save it accordingly.	6
In this Revision Bite, you will learn about preparing images for screen. A web browser is a piece of software that is used to view and download the content of webpages. It translates the HTMLHypertext Markup Language (HTML): web pages are written in HTML, web browsers interpret HTML and render or display the end result pages to display various types of files such as text, audio, video and graphics. There is a common standard for how this should be done. Mozilla Firefox and Microsoft's Internet Explorer are the two main browsers that currently dominate the market. They provide users with a graphical interface to explore the web. Most browsers have standard features, but different web browsers show things in slightly different ways. This is why it is always important to test your webpages and graphics in more than one browser, to ensure the end user sees what you want them to see. Visually impaired users can use text-only web browsers such as Lynx. This type of browser displays only text and no images. You can provide a text description of all the images you use in your webpages in the image tags in your HTMLHypertext Markup Language (HTML): web pages are written in HTML, web browsers interpret HTML and render or display the end result. This ensures that visually impaired users are aware of the point of the image.	6
You must consider bandwidth when you are designing your images. If you are designing a website with lots of images, it is important to think about how long these images will take to download to a user's web browserweb browser: an application used to browse the Internet or view web pages. The higher the bandwidth, the faster the images will download. Large image files can take up a lot of bandwidth [bandwidth: Bandwidth measures the amount of data that can transfer through a communications channnel over a given period of time. ], so it is important to reduce the file size of your images when saving them to use on a webpage. A JPG or GIF are the most suitable file formats for saving images to use on the web, because the size of the original file is dramatically reduced.	6
A digital image consists of a matrix, or grid of pixels. It is very much like painting by numbers - each colour is added to the correct pixel [pixel: One of the individual units (often called dots) that make up an image ]. The number of pixels will depend on the resolution [resolution: The fineness of detail that can be seen in an image - the higher the resolution of an image, the more detail it holds. It is measured in dots per inch (dpi). ] of the image. When saving the images you have created, it is important to save a master image. This is the original image at the optimum resolution. It is useful to have a copy of the original image in case you are unhappy with the version you have manipulated.	6
Images can be saved in a variety of file formats. Different file formats exist because some are better at certain tasks than others. Some file formats are associated with specific software programs. For example, Adobe Photoshop's file format is .PSD. However, graphics packages also allow the user to save their work in compatible file formats that can be used in a variety of software programs - eg .JPG, .GIF, .TIFF. Most digital cameras automatically save photographs as .JPG and these can be used in a variety of graphics packages.	6
The JPG is probably the most common file format now in use for storing digital images, especially on the web. It is ideal for images that use more than 256 colours, such as digital photographs. When you save an image using this format, some of the data is lost because the file is compressed [compressed: Made smaller by squeezing together. ]. JPG files can be saved at various quality settings which are measured as a percentage of the original quality. The lower the quality percentage, the higher the compression rate; therefore if storage space is an issue, you should aim to save your JPG file at 30 per cent quality. The table below shows a photograph that has been saved as a JPG and a GIF. The many colours of this digital photo have been preserved through saving it as a JPG. It was saved at a 30 per cent quality setting and has a file size of 7kb. When saved as a GIF using 32 colours, the image is quite patchy and some of the colours are missing. It also has a much larger file size - this time it's11kb. Like the JPG, the GIF file format is commonly used on the web. It is ideal for images that have large blocks of a single colour, and it can support up to a maximum of 256 colours. Unlike with JPGs, it is possible to alter the background colour of a GIF to make it transparent [transparent: able to be seen through; clear ]. This makes it possible to place it over other images or on webpages. When you save an image as a GIF, you can decide how many colours to use - 256 colours is the maximum amount and 2 is the minimum (black and white). The fewer colours you use, the smaller the file size will be. The table below shows a logo graphic that has been saved both as a GIF and as a JPG. Look closely at the orange background - the image looks speckled. The logo uses few colours only, so is ideal to save as a GIF. In this case, it has been saved using 128 colours and is 3.5kb in file size. When saved as a JPG at a 30 per cent quality setting, the logo is slightly fuzzy and dull. It is also bigger in file size, at 5kb. A TIFF file is a suitable file format for both Windows and Macintosh computers, meaning it can be easily shared between computers. Just like a JPG, a TIFF file can be compressed to reduce the file size, while still maintaining a high degree of image fidelity. Alternatively, it can be saved without compression to retain 100 per cent of the original image taken - where each pixel is identical to the original image taken. This is an appropriate file format for Windows users. It is used for general storage purposes - such as when images are awaiting editing - or as wallpaper for a Windows desktop. BMPs aren't really suitable for Macintosh computers or the web. BMP images are large files that require a lot of storage space because no effort is made to reduce the file size. Now check your understanding of file types, by playing this file types activity - just choose the correct file formats and settings for each image.	6
Before handing in your project for marking, it's important that you check the work thoroughly. This is called proofreading. Proofreading gives you a chance to make sure no words are missing and the spelling is correct. It is also a good idea to check that punctuation such as question marks, apostrophes, commas and full stops are in the right places. During the proofreading stage, you should refer to a dictionary or use the spellcheck and grammar check functions provided in a word processing program. Don't always rely on your computer spellchecker though. It won't pick up errors such as using 'bean' instead of 'been'. Make sure you leave enough time to proofread because it's an important part of your work. Many people find it difficult to spot mistakes when reading text on a computer screen, so it's a good idea to print the final copy and proofread it on paper. It is also a good idea to ask someone else to look over what you have written. A fresh pair of eyes can often spot mistakes you may have missed.	6
Using a diary can help you plan ahead, for example, booking equipment You will only have certain software and hardware available to you. Make sure you don't spend time planning something if you do not have the facilities to achieve it. Some hardware/software might only be available at certain times. For example, your teacher may only provide a digital camera for three or four lessons, so you must plan to use it when it is available. You may need to explain things like this in your plan. Explain that you have to be flexible about the order in which you do certain things because of these 'external constraintsexternal constraints: circumstances beyond your control'.	6
All the work you submit in your eportfolio should follow the laws of copyright. This means you are not allowed to use text, images, sounds and other such material that belongs to someone else without their permission. If you have been given permission to use material in your project, it's essential that you list these sources in your bibliography [bibliography: a list of books, articles and web sites which you have used throughout your project ]. A bibliography is a list of all the sources - books, magazines, websites and reports - that you use for your project. All the work you submit should follow the laws of copyright. This means you are not allowed to use text, images, sounds, or other material that belongs to someone else. You cannot use material found on the internet unless the owner gives permission for it to be used. This country's copyright laws are very strict and organisations have to be very careful about what material they use. Fines for incorrect use can be very high. The BBC has a whole department dedicated to making sure that all the material for the website has been checked. It is a complicated process and can take months to do. If you want to use images found on the internet, you will need to follow a similar process, so start checking early!	6
Plagiarism is passing off somebody elseâ€™s work as your own. If the exam board catches you doing this, you would automatically fail the course, and it could put your other exams in jeopardy as well. Authors don't mind students quoting them, as long as their name is mentioned in the text whenever you refer to their work. You also need to include the author in your bibliography. If you don't include references [references: if you have directly quoted someone else, then you must include them in your references ] for original text, you'll be guilty of plagiarism [plagiarism: copy a piece of work and passing it off as your own ]. Whenever you use words straight from a text, you should put quotation marks around them, and give a reference to show where the text came from.	6
You can use copyright-free images like Clipart, and some material on the internet is also copyright-free. You must make sure that the images you use are suitable. Many Clipart and free images are a bit tacky and not suitable for some of the tasks you will have been set. For a list of websites that offer free images, see the section on Web Research Thousands of students are studying for DiDA, and they are all likely to have found the same good image on the internet. If the marker keeps seeing the same image, they will know it came from the internet and may check to see if you have checked that you can use it. Donâ€™t rely on getting material from the internet - it is much better to find ways of generating your own resources. Try to get hold of a digital camera to take suitable photographs, use a scanner to capture your own drawings and plans, use a digital video camera to film an interview, record sounds using a microphone or get hold of a software package such as Fruity Loops to produce music. If you create resources, the exam board will be much more impressed, you will learn a lot more, and will not be in danger of infringing anyoneâ€™s copyright.	6
Your eportfolio can be created using various file types such as Word, Excel or Publisher. These files must be converted to an acceptable format - such as PDFPortable Document Format (PDF): a file format developed by Adobe in an effort to standardise the way documents were shared files - before they are handed in. Check the details listed in the SPB to find out what formats are acceptable. Word, Excel and Publisher produce files that need converting to PDF format before they can be submitted. You need to plan the structure of the folder/directory system you will use to store these files. There are several ways to do this - the important thing is to show you've thought about what you need to produce, and the folders you need to store your files in. Below are a couple of ways you could do it. 1. List of sub-folders, files, file type and purpose 2. File organisation chart	6
The exam board specifies that your eportfolio can only include certain files. Check the SPB for the latest list. Currently, Word, Excel and Publisher files cannot be submitted in eportfolios. There are a number of ways to change the format of a file. In a program such as Word, click File and the Save As option. Then look for a suitable file type in the list underneath where you put the filename. Sometimes, particularly with scanning or using graphics programs, you will need to use the export option and then look for a suitable file type. The easiest way to make sure you have the right formats is to get hold of a PDF converterPDF converter: convert documents into to PDF format or vice versa. This is a program that can save any document as a PDF file. Open up the PDF program, and select File and Create PDF. Then choose the file or files that you wish to convert. You will then be asked where you want to save the new files. Usually, once the PDF converter has been installed, it will appear as an extra printer in the printer options. If you choose to print to the PDF converter, it will just produce a PDF version of your file. This will work for most file types. Commonly used ones are Pdf995 and PrimoPDF, but a search on the internet for 'PDF converters' will provide you with several options. Movie and sound files are potentially the biggest problem. Make sure the programs and hardware you want to use can store data in an allowed format before you start work.	6
It would be ideal if people from the 'target audience' could evaluate your work. For example, if you have to produce a leaflet for six to eight-year-olds, ask a six to eight-year-old what they think of the leaflet you have produced. If you have to prepare a presentation for the parents of children at your school, ask your parents to look at your presentation. Sometimes it will not be possible to ask members of the 'target audience'. If this is the case, you might want to use 'peer review'. This means asking one of your class mates to look at your work and say what they think. What is absolutely crucial is that you include time in your plan for this to happen. Keep asking yourself 'Is what I have produced fit for the intended purpose?'	6
If you are getting stuck on words to use in your evaluation, use a word processor's thesaurus to help. In Word, try out the thesaurus â€“ highlight the word and press Shift + F7 or tools, language and thesaurus on the toolbar. The thesaurus will give suggestions for alternate words with the same meaning, which can help to make your writing more exciting. Word also has tools to help you check how 'readable' your text is. Type 'reading statistics' into the Help Search to find out about them. You can then mention this in your evaluation â€“ this is great if you have to write for a certain audience. The statistics give you the average length of sentences and the average length or words. Often the lower the statistic, the more suitable your publication is for younger audiences.	6
The mark scheme says you must meet all deadlines if you are to be awarded the full five marks. However, this does not mean that if you miss one deadline by a day you will not get full marks. The idea is to use your plan to manage your project. If you are getting a bit behind, just update your plan with a new set of deadlines for the tasks and make sure you meet those new deadlines. Have a look at the deadline plan below. It shows subtasks, deadlines and comments for a task to create a leaflet. 03/06/08 - this only took 5 minutes 07/06/08 - I came back to look at key points quite often and looked at the website to check I was doing this right thing. Overall this took 15 minutes. 03/06/08 - A group of 3 of us discussed the issue and came up with more than enough ideas to fill 4 pages of the leaflet. 03/06/08 - I spent quite a bit of time on the internet looking for more information on the ideas I came up with in 4b. Next time I will set aside more time for this sort of research. 04/06/08 - I did this as a homework task. I showed it to my parents and asked them for some feedback, then came up with a second version based on their comments. 04/06/08 - I took some pictures of my little brother using the computer but could not get all the images I wanted. I will need to look on the internet for more images to use. 07/06/08 - Spent an extra 30 minutes looking at various pictures on the internet but could not use them for copyright reasons. Next time will make my own graphics. As long as all the work is completed by the time it has to be sent off to the exam board, you can say you met all the deadlines. Make sure you put notes somewhere in your plan to show how you adapted your plan to take account of the circumstances faced.	6
Now have a go at evaluating some DiDA products. There is a poster, a letter and a graph on the following pages. Read each task carefully. How well do the products meet the task requirements? Are the products suitable for audience? Suitable for purpose? Are styles and formats suitable for the target audiences? How can the products be improved? Check your answers with the table below each product. Produce an A5 flyer to hand out to students to advertise a sale of sports goods at your school or college. Include the time, date and location of the sale. Use suitable graphics to make the flyer eye-catching and attractive.	6
Once you have an idea of the main tasks involved in a project, break down each task into smaller, more manageable sub-tasks. Think about all the different things you need to do for each task, and the order they need to be done in, and add them to your overall plan. Allocate a number to each main task and give each sub-task a number or letter to show which main task it is part of, and where it is in the order. Task 3: Produce a formal letter to a newspaper explaining why animal experiments might be necessary. Once you have an idea of the main tasks involved in a project, break down each task into smaller, more manageable sub-tasks. You could write this plan on paper and scan it before saving it on your computer. You could also write it straight onto the computer using a word processor, a spreadsheet, a mind mapping application or other suitable software.	6
When you've a good idea of all the tasks and sub-tasks to complete, decide how much time each task will take and the order they need to be completed in. Then draw up a table to show your overall plan. The table should explain the task and show how much time you've set aside to do it. It's also a good idea to leave some space for notes explaining any changes you made and any problems you had to overcome. You could include other details like the example below. A table showing a plan for tasks, including Task, Time allocated, Completed, Date completed, Actual time taken, and Problems. Remember you might have to be flexible about the order some things are done in. For example, if you only have access to a digital camera for one lesson, you must use it when it is available and reschedule what you had originally planned. Make sure you make a note of this somewhere in your plans. Try to anticipate what problems you might face, and include some way of making sure these don't delay your plans too much. Project tip - Many students attempt to do the overall plan as a GANTT chart. This is a diagram that shows the order tasks must be done in and the length of time it should take. Do an image search on the internet for GANTT chart in a search enginesearch engine: a tool for searching the contents of the Internet, eg Google, Yahoo! or Live such as Google or Altavista to see examples of how other people do it. GANTT charts can get complicated and don't always show all the information you need to get good marks. It's fine to include a GANTT chart, but don't rely on it for everything.	6
No matter how good your plan is, it's unlikely your work will go exactly as you intended. The exam board knows this and examiners expect to see evidence that you have regularly adapted your plan. It's a good idea to set two or three key dates [key dates: a specified dates assigned to key tasks ] during your project, where you go through your plan and match up what you have actually done with what you said you would do in your plan. If you are behind, this is a good time to change your plan and set new deadlines and objectives. You may need to be less ambitious about what you hope to achieve. Make sure you note all this down - it will earn you marks.	6
You are not planning just for the sake of planning. The whole idea is that planning helps you manage your work, and allows you to work more efficiently. Try to show this in the evidence you produce. In your work, show the development of each product. Refer back to your original plans, comment on the things that went well and the things you had to do differently. In your overall plan, include a section for each task, explaining the difference between what you planned and what you actually did. Describe how you used your plan. Keep updating your plan and deadlines.	6
Keep evidence in a safe place, like a folder Always keep your evidence! Before you even start planning the project, remember that you have to keep evidence of the planning stage. You could either do this on a computer or on paper that you scan in, or take a digital photograph of your plan. It's a good idea to keep all your work in a folder. This could include information you have researched, designs you have sketched out, and documents or graphics you are part way through, as well as your plans.	6
Different parts of your project will need to be written in different styles. For example, you might be asked to design a leaflet for primary school children or write a letter to the owner of a local business. It's important to tailor your writing style to these different audiences. Most of us switch from formal to informal style when we speak to people, without even thinking. For example, you need to ask different people for a pen. You'd probably say something fairly informal to your friend, but be more formal when speaking to your teacher, and even more formal if you approached a stranger. So, you approach people differently depending on how well you know them and their age group. Generally, we're more down-to-earth and chatty when we know someone well, especially if they are our own age. It's the same in writing. However, a slightly more formal tone is usually taken in any type of writing. If you're writing for a young audience, think about a more informal style.	6
"You may choose to use audio in your multimedia product - either through capturing your own audio files or by using existing audio clips. In this Revision Bite you will learn how to source audio and carry out basic functions in audio editing software. You may decide to capture your own audio files by using a microphone attached to your computer. This is probably the easiest method of getting sound files onto your PC. However, your school may have some other devices that can be used to capture audio. These could include minidiscs, electronic dictaphones, or even digital video cameras (you can always strip the sound file out in video editing software). Most mobile phones can record audio, although the quality may not be great. It's also worth considering sourcing audio from the web. This will save time if the sound effect or clip you plan to use has already been created. There are a number of websites offering free audio clips that can be downloaded directly to your computer. Check the useful links below to get you started. Visit these sites to download free audio clips and effects. A selection of free clips - ranging from Homer Simpson's famous ""DOH!"" to the sound of an ambulance rushing by. A search engine dedicated to finding the sounds you need. Free sound effects covering a wide range of subjects."	6
Most audio software will have features that are similar to the ones shown below. Screenshot of audio software highlighting the controls, display and timeline The controls allow the user to record, play back, fast-forward, rewind, stop and pause an audio track. The display is a visual representation of the audio track on the screen. You can zoom into the waveform and get a further breakdown of the track - useful for editing out silences or coughs. The timeline allows you to see how long in seconds (or minutes) the track is - this is useful if you need to edit a track down to a certain length.	6
You can capture sound from various sources. You will need to select the source and an appropriate record level. In the example below, you can see how to record the sound from a microphone. When you are ready to start the recording, click the record button. When you are ready to stop the recording, click the stop button. The display will show you the sound you just recorded.	6
A multimedia product should meet the needs and interests of its users. Therefore before you begin to design your product, you must consider the audience for it, and its purpose. PThis Revision Bite will discuss the fundamentals of good design. A multimedia product should meet the needs and interests of its users. Good multimediamultimedia: the use of several types of media outputs from a computer in order to give the user a richer and more interesting experience design is about considering who will use the product, why they want to use it, and how they will use it. An effective multimedia product should match the needs and interests of its users, so remember to consider the target audience before you even start your design. A multimedia product may have several different audiences. It is important to tailor the look, feel and tone of your product to the different types of people who will use it. You must also consider the purpose of your product - whether it is meant to educate, inform or sell. Play the activity and match the product to the correct audience.	6
"A common complaint about multimedia products is: ""I canâ€™t find anything!"" As a multimedia designer, you must first decide how users will navigatenavigate: find your way around your product. Navigation is the means that allows users to move around a multimedia product. The most important thing about navigation is to keep it clear and simple. The end-user should be able to quickly identify where the navigation links are located and where the links will take them. A hierarchical concept (such as a sitemap) within a multimedia product can be useful, helping users to navigate to areas of interest. Listed below are three main methods of navigation. You could use one or more of them for your multimedia product."	6
Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) involves the study of how humans interact with computers. It focuses on designing, constructing and implementing an interactive computer system that is user-friendly. Most systems rely on a graphical user interface (GUI) such as Windows. The GUI uses menus and icons to show the user the options on offer on the site. When a menu item or an icon is selected, the system is instructed to perform a specific task. As a multimedia designer, you must consider the users of your product and place emphasis on interaction. This means you should think about usability. Usability focuses on designing a multimedia product that is effective, efficient, and satisfies the userâ€™s needs, achieving specified goals in a particular environment. For example, if you are designing a multimedia website whose purpose is to sell something, you would measure usability by watching how quickly a user can locate and buy that item. It's good practice to put your product through usability tests, as they often reveal problems that are overlooked by designers.	6
Before you build your multimedia product, you should create some detailed designs. You could use one or more of the following to help you. A flowchart shows the path of a multimedia product. This flowchart shows the paths through a quiz. A structure diagram shows the overall structure of a multimedia product. This structure diagram shows the pages and links of a company's website A storyboard shows the layout and content of a multimedia product. This storyboard has been sketched - the four panels show the 'story' with additional notes written around the panels. This storyboard has been created from a template. There is space below each panel to write the action and dialogue.	6
Your multimedia project may require you to create your own graphics, or to manipulate [manipulate: To change or edit as desired. ] graphics you already have. In this Revision Bite, you will learn how to work with the most basic tools used in graphics software, and carry out simple editing techniques. If you haven't already read the Bitmap and vector graphics Revision Bite in the Graphics section, you should read it now. 3. Locate the image and click 'Open'.	6
The vector tools are particularly good for drawing definite shapes and lines. They can also be used to add text to a graphic. To draw a shape, simply select the desired tool from the vector tools panel, and drag [drag: In computer software, you drag something by selecting it with your mouse, holding down the left mouse button (or the mouse button on a Mac), moving it to the desired place and releasing the button. ] it into position on the canvas to create your design. To add text to a graphic, simply select the text tool, drag it into position on the canvas, and type the text into the box. To add text, click on the text tool The properties of the shapes and text boxes (such as colours, sizes, font types) can be changed in the properties window.	6
It is important that your multimedia product functions properly, conveys the right message and is suitable for the target audience. To ensure that your product is fit for the audience and purpose, you should use a process known as prototyping and testing. In this Revision Bite, you will learn about prototyping and testing and discover why it is so important. You will also learn how to choose the best reviewers. A prototype is an initial version of a multimedia product. The prototype is tested to make sure it is fit for the audience and purpose. If there are any errors or problems, the prototype is improved and tested again. This goes on until the product is considered to be fully functional and suitable. This process is known as prototyping and testing and is illustrated in the flow diagram below.	6
Today there are thousands of multimedia products on the market, to serve many tastes. Some products are appropriate for one audience, but not necessarily another. For example, a game for creating fashion designs is likely to appeal to young girls, but would perhaps be less appealing to boys. Similarly a bike racing game would probably not appeal to many young girls. Multimedia products usually have a clear purpose - which might be to educate, inform or entertain. For example, the purpose of a movie could be to warn of the dangers of smoking. If this movie does not get the information across to the audience in an effective and memorable way, it will not have the intended impact on the audience. Prototyping and testing is important because it will show you if your product is suitable for the audience and if your product its serving its purpose. You will need to use reviewers to evaluate your multimedia product and give you feedback. The feedback you receive from your reviewers will help you improve your product.	6

Always aim to get feedback from a range of potential users. Below are some of the things to consider during the prototyping and testing process.	6
You might want all the slides in your presentation to have consistent fonts, colours and layout etc. The slide master facility allows you to do this, through applying your chosen style to all the slides in your presentation. To view the slide master:Select View > Master > Slide Master. View menu with 'Master' and 'Slide Master' highlighted You should see the slide master, similar to this. You can edit the text styles, fonts and font colours in the slide master. You can also add images or shapes. Here you can see a master slide that has been edited with colours and images. Every slide in this presentation will now have pink bars of colour at the top and bottom and the images that spell out 'JANICE' down the right-hand side. To switch back to the normal view:Select View > Normal. Now in the normal view, you can see that the formatting has been applied to the three slides that were previously blank.	6
A multimedia product uses a combination of images, words and sounds to present information. Multimedia is increasingly being used in education, advertising and entertainment. In this Revision Bite, you will learn about the different types of multimedia products. Many people like computer games. Many of us use websites or watch DVDs. All these devices combine text, sound, images and video to present information to us. Text, sound, image (moving and still) and video are known as multimedia components. The combination of these components is multimedia. Multimedia can be used to convey information to people effectively. It has brought fundamental changes to the way we learn, play and inform ourselves.	6
Traditionally, computer-based education training programs used separate multimedia components such as texts, images, audio clips and video clips, and presented them in a sequence decided by the author. Nowadays, multimedia in education allows the programs to be user-driven [user-driven: Software or an application that is controlled or maintained solely by the user. ], and not restricted by time. It has been shown that the use of multimedia teaching resources has helped many students to understand their studies better, and to remember things better, too. Computer Tutor is an online e-learning resource E-learning involves following a learning or education program through electronic means. Interest in e-learning is growing fast, because students can study at a time that suits them, almost wherever they live, and can study from home if they want.	6
A multimedia product should entertain and engross the user. Entertainment sources can be viewed in a variety of multimedia contexts, including games, videos and DVDs. People can even view film trailers on websites or play games on websites. DVD is short for digital versatile disk. A single-sided DVD can store 4.7GB of data and a dual-layer DVD can hold 8.4GB. DVDs are useful for storing data that contains video footage, because this requires a large storage capacity. Blu-ray Discs designed to store high definition video can hold as much as 50 GB.	6
When marketing [marketing: The activity of transferring goods from producers to consumers - most commonly marketing is used to refer to advertising. ] and advertising [advertising: The method by which a good or service is promoted to its potential consumer base. ] a product, it is important to identify, anticipate and satisfy the end-user's requirements. Multimedia has altered the way products are advertised and marketed, and offered a new marketplace for this activity. The use of websites has opened a new area for advertising and marketing. Products are advertised in banners, pop-up windows, links, embedded video, flash movies and more. Whether you're using a website to research a project or just checking your email, adverts are hard to escape. This banner for Bitesize appeared on non-BBC websites to advertise the service Most companies that have a website will produce monthly newsletters or regular emails that consumers can sign up to receive. Often customers can choose what products they are most interested in and will then receive news and offers about those particular items. Many software companies allow customers to download free trials directly from their websites so they can try before they buy. Consumers can even read chapters of books online to get a taster as to whether they want to buy the book. Some companies market and advertise through the use of DVDs that can be requested by customers or sent through the mail directly into their homes.	6
Slink is an e-zine aimed at teenage girls Multimedia has also affected publications. As well as reading traditional books or magazines, consumers can now read e-publications. These are publications that are published electronically through mediums such as the internet. E-books and e-zines (the electronic equivalent of magazines) can be read online, downloaded to a computer, or even downloaded to a portable device such as a PDA [PDA: Personal Digital Assistant - a type of handheld mini computer. ].	6
A virtual reality program presents you with multi-sensory information and 3D effects in real-time. When you interact with a virtual reality program you have a sense of being completely immersed in it. Many museums and institutions now offer virtual tours of their buildings on their websites, and these give you the impression of walking through the actual museums, making your own decisions about where to go. Virtual reality can be used to simulate [simulate: A realistic imitation of the world or particular activity. ] real events, such as flying an aeroplane. Aeroplane flight simulation programs offer the experience of flying an aircraft without leaving the ground. The main advantage of this is that pilots can be presented with what look like dangerous situations, and learn how to deal with them, but their lives are not at risk.	6
A woman using a public information point: You might be asked to produce an on-screen publication for an information point Multimedia public access points are often located in museums or town centres. People use them as an information point to find out what they want to know. For example, a bus station may use a public access point to inform customers of bus times, or tourist information centres may use access points to inform people about tourist attractions and events. The interfaces rely on being simple and user-friendly, so everyone can use them regardless of ability or experience. A lot of public access points use a touch-screen input device because they are easy-to-use, hard to damage, and they are more hard-wearing than a mouse and keyboard. A user-friendly screen layout is most important when designing a public information access point. If you design one, you must think carefully about the way in which you present the information. It needs to be clear and easy to understand, even for people who are not used to multimedia products.	6
The idea for a video starts with a plan or storyboard. Once the video is recorded, it will need to be edited using video editing software. In this Revision Bite, you will learn how to create and edit video for your multimedia product. If you decide to record video for your multimedia product, your first task should involve creating a storyboard [storyboard: A type of plan often used when designing video, animation or multimedia applications. It involves drawing a panel of rough sketches outlining what is going to happen. ]. A storyboard is a visual plan, usually depicting each scene you intend to film. It can also contain notes about the action for the scene, audio and dialogue, and camera angles and shots.	6
Video editing software allows you to capture (import) your video footage and then edit it into a movie. You can cut and delete unwanted scenes, add images and background audio, or add text titles. Some advanced packages also allow you to create effects or enhance your footage, for example by carrying out colour correction. There are numerous video software packages available - some are quite simple and offer basic editing tools, whereas others are industry standard and used by professionals. Read on for a quick guide on how to carry out the most basic functions in video editing software. A community-driven website created by users of Windows Movie Maker. It is featured on the Microsoft Windows XP Expert Zone website. The software authors' website. An outline of Pinnacle Studioâ€™s features.

"There are several ways to capture video. You can film footage using a video camera; use footage that is already stored on a VHS tape or DVD; use a webcam to film live footage; or use exisiting video clips that may be saved as .AVI or .WMV files (there are websites on the internet that offer free video clips to download). It is likely that you will be filming your own video footage using a video camera. When filming is complete, you will need to transfer the footage to your computer. You can do this by using the 'Capture' option in video editing software. File menu with ""capture video..."" selected Screenshot of the File menu showing the 'Import into Collections' option highlighted You may also want to import existing video clips, still images, or sound files into the software, to use in addition to your video footage. Most video editing software has an 'Import' function that allows you to do this."	6
The storyboard and timeline are where you will build and arrange your movie, bringing all your clips, stills and sound files together. Some video editing packages make use of a storyboard, which is a useful feature because it allows you to assemble the clips in the correct order before editing them. In the image below, you can see a storyboard with two clips in place. Some packages do not have storyboards, but all packages do have a timeline. This is where you can edit the movie, add effects, text and sound. If you've already arranged your clips on a storyboard, you will be able to see them in the timeline by selecting View > Timeline. If you have not arranged your clips in a storyboard, or do not have that function available, you can still arrange the clips on the timeline. To add a clip to the timeline, simply drag [drag: In computer software, you drag something by selecting it with your mouse, holding down the left mouse button (or the mouse button on a Mac), moving it to the desired place and releasing the button. ] it from the Collections pane (or Project window) onto the timeline, as the image below illustrates. You can trim your clips on the timeline and edit out unwanted footage. The image below illustrates editing out the end of a clip. You can add audio to the timeline by dragging the desired sound file to the Audio/Music bar. Here, you can edit it in the same way you would edit a video clip. The images below show the audio file on the timeline, which is then edited to match the length of the footage.	6
"A Cascading Style Sheet (CSS), more simply referred to as a style sheet, is a separate document that contains all the information about style for your webpage or website. You don't have to use a style sheet - fonts, colours and size can be coded directly into your HTMLHypertext Markup Language (HTML): web pages are written in HTML, web browsers interpret HTML and render or display the end result document - but there are many good reasons for separating your webpage's content and style. The main reason for using a style sheet is because it will save time. You might finish your website and decide that you don't like the font and the font colour. If you don't have a style sheet, it could be very time-consuming to change the font and colour for each separate paragraph of text. With a style sheet, you only have to make the change once, save your changes and then refresh your browser and all the text will change accordingly. Using a style sheet makes it easier to be organised as you create your site, and makes it simpler to make changes. When you want to make a style change, you will know where to look, and not have to search through lines of HTML code. These days websites aren't just viewed on your computer screen. They can be viewed on mobile phones, PDA [PDA: Personal Digital Assistant - a type of handheld mini computer. ]s and television screens. You may need to apply different styles for different platform [platform: A platform requires to the architecture of a particular piece of technology (and sometimes software). The most common technology platform is the computer, but more recent platforms include mobile phones, PDAs and game consoles. ]s, and style sheets enable you to do this. You could develop one style sheet for use in a normal web browserweb browser: an application used to browse the Internet or view web pages, and another made for mobile phones. Here is an excerpt from a style sheet used on Bitesize. This part determines which font and size to use for the headings H1 to H3. Using a style sheet is very simple - you put a link to it within the head section of your HTML document. Note that you must use the file extension .CSS for all style sheets. <link rel=""stylesheet"" href=""mystyle.css"" type=""text/css""> The href attribute is the link to where your style sheet is kept. In the screenshot below, you can see the head information for a GCSE Bitesize webpage. The link to the style sheet can be seen on line 5."	6
Metadata is information that is entered into the metadata tags within the head section of an HTMLHypertext Markup Language (HTML): web pages are written in HTML, web browsers interpret HTML and render or display the end result document. The metadata tags allow you to enter a description of your page and key words associated with it. These are used by search engines and other computer applications to find and rank your website. Better metadata can affect how high your website rank is in search results, so it's worth spending time describing your site. For example, if you were designing a website for a fitness club, the metadata would include words such as fitness, health, gym, aerobics. Take a look at the screenshot below, and note the metadata included in this page. Now play the activity that will help you to recognise style sheets and metadata within HTML documents.	6
A table structure will help you to layout your webpage. To insert a table select:Insert > Table. A Table box will pop up that will allow you to enter the number of rows and columns you want your table to have. In this box, when you get more ambitious, you can also specify other attributes such as cell spacing and padding, border thickness, and extra information for accessibility. Click 'OK' and your table will be inserted onto your page. If you want to merge (join) some of the cells in the table:1. Highlight the cells you want to merge.2. Right click.3. Select Table.4. Select Merge cells. You can see below that the cells of the top row have been selected. When merged, they will leave space for a title bar for your table. You could also change other properties of the table by using the properties window. For example, the background colour of a cell. The properties of the table on the page shown below have been changed to make some of the cells different colours.	6
"You can add background sound to your webpage. Start by switching to the code view. In the head section, you will need to add the following details: <sound src=""location of the sound file"" loop=""infinite""> If you like the loop can be a number, which will determine how often the sound file is played. In the example of the code shown here, the loop number is 2, so the sound file will be played twice through. <sound src=""location of the sound file"" loop=""2""> If you decide to use a background sound, think about giving the user a choice to turn it off - background sounds can be annoying. Always remember who your audience is - children often enjoy background noise, whereas adults can find it distracting."	6
A database is an organised collection of structured data. The content of a database is easy to manage as information can be accessed and updated quickly. As well as storing information, databases are used for producing reports. A database is an organised collection of structured data. A database is an organised collection of structured data. Databases are used to store and handle data such as customer details for a business, medical records at a surgery and stock items in a warehouse. Database content is easy to manage. Information can be accessed and updated quickly and efficiently. A database can store and handle vast amounts of data. A user can sort and search a database to find any requested data. It is the electronic equivalent of a filing cabinet.	6
Two essential features of a database include sort and search. The sort and search facility makes it possible to retrieve information very quickly from large amounts of stored data. Being able to sort data in a database is an important function. Records in a database can be sorted into ascending (lowest value first) or descending (highest value first) order. It is possible to sort using text fields and numeric fields. Having the option to search for a specific record or set of records saves time and is a very important function of a database. When performing a search, the computer will look for data that meets specified conditions outlined by the user. A simple search will ask the database to look for specified data meeting one criterion. For example, the Head of Year 10 would like to send a letter home to the parentsâ€™ of 10D informing them about a forthcoming school trip. The simple search would specify all students in Year 10 equal 10D. The database would pull up all the records for 10D. This will ask the database to search for specified data meeting more than one criterion. For example, the Head of Year wants to send a letter home informing the parentsâ€™ of 10D who are 15 and over about a forthcoming school trip. The database would search all records to find all students in Year 10 equal 10D and age is greater than or equal to 15. The database would pull up all records of pupils in 10D who are 15 or older. A database uses symbols when searching [searching: it is a function which enables users to search the database to find information matching specified criteria ] for specific data. Each symbol is given a meaning, look at the table below. A wildcard enables the user to search for a specified field when the user cannot remember the full value to search for. For example, the user would like to find Sarah Hammill, but cannot remember how to spell her surname. Using a wildcard, the user can enter Ham. The program will search the database to find all surnames beginning with Ham.	6
It's most likely that you will be using Microsoft Access to build a database. Follow the steps below to get started with setting up a database. A database about local Healthy Living Clubs is used as an example. 1. To open a new database, select File and New from the top toolbar. Click File and New on the toolbar. 2. Choose which folder you want to save your database in. Then give the file a suitable name. Click Create. 3. Select Create table in Design view from the list of options. Select 'Create table in Design view' 4. Type your field names into the table. Select the appropriate data type from the drop down menu.	6
"Follow these steps to set up a validation rule in a database. The example used is a database for ""Healthy Living"" clubs. The database is designed to hold the following information: organisation, whether the club is local, town, postcode, telephone number, web address and the support offered. Support offered can be NA - nutritional advice, EP for exercise plan, HP for health plan or MA for motivational advice. 1. Select Design. This will open the table so you can edit the appropriate details. Opening a database table. Click on Table on the left-hand side. Then select the Design tab at the top. 2. Use the keyboard arrow keys to select the field to which you want to add a validation rule, eg 'Support offered'. 3. Select the General menu page. 4. Support offered can be NA - nutritional advice, EP for exercise plan, MA for motivational advice or HP - health plan. The validation rule is set so only these options can be entered. The Support offered row is highlighted. The validation rule is set for Support Offered. A box below is labelled General. The top row in the General Box is labelled Field Size. This reads 2. The field size determines how many characters can be typed into the field, in this example, only two characters. In the validation rule box 'NA' or 'EP' or 'HP' or 'MA' have been entered. Only this text can be entered by users in the Support Offered field. In the Validation Text box, 'You must enter NA for Nutrition Advice, EP for Eating Plan etc... has been entered'. This is the text that appears if the user enters unaceptable text into the Support Offered field. 5. Close the table and click Yes when asked if you want to save changes. Can you remember the different types of validation?"	6
Collecting information is an important part of your project. You will need to collect factsfacts: something that is accurate and true, statistics [statistics: collection and interpretation of data ] and images from various sources. In this section, you will find out about different types of information you will need for your project and where to find them. Secondary sources of information: newspaper If you use information that has been produced by somebody else, it is known as a secondary source. It's important to keep records showing where all the information from secondary sourcessecondary sources: a commentary or analysis of information that has been produced by someone else that you used came from. For notes on the correct way to acknowledge sources, see the Bitesize DiDA: Bibliography section.	6

For notes on the correct way to acknowledge sources, see the Bitesize DiDA: Bibliography section. When using secondary sources you need to be aware that the information could be biased. Information is biased when it is written to give only one particular opinion or to influence people's views. Could this report be slightly biased? You need to avoid using biased information. Sometimes you won't be able to find the information you require from secondary sources and you may have to create information yourself. Any information that you create yourself is known as a primary source. You will need to show some evidence of using primary sources in your project work.	6
For the D201 project, you are likely to have to produce two of the three types of screen-based publications - websites, information points and presentations. You will probably be familiar with websites and presentations, but you might have to do a bit more investigation to find examples of information points. Spend a bit of time investigating screen-based publications and note what makes them effective - or not! A woman using a public information point: You might be asked to produce an on-screen publication for an information point The crucial thing is to make sure that each publication you make is suitable for the intended purpose and audience. As with other publications in the D201 course, you donâ€™t have to worry too much about using all the advanced features of the piece of software you are using. The exam board is much more keen to see that you have thought about what you are doing and have produced a suitable solution. This will involve careful planning, testing and modifying of each product you develop.	6
A navigation chart is used when there is potentially more than one way to navigate through your product. For example, on a website each user may want to visit pages in a different order and on an information point, the user may want to view some sections and not others. A navigation chart starts with the main welcome screen or home page at the top and then shows the different ways a user can access the various parts of the product. There is no compulsory way of doing this. What is important is that you show you have thought about the best way to structure your product and how you are making it suitable for the intended audience. In general, a navigation chart will contain less detail than a storyboard. A storyboard shows what each screen will look like, but a navigation chart shows the possible pathways between the screens. For the products you are producing, it may be sensible to put a bit more detail on your navigation charts, so that you have a design for each page you hope to produce. Add notes to your diagram to explain exactly what you are trying to achieve. Explain the reasons for the choices you have made.	6
An information point is a set of screens that provide information on a particularly topic. You've probably seen information points in stations, airports, museums and places or interest. Make sure your Index page has links to all content. When you're designing an information point, it must be possible for the user to navigate to the information they want without having to scroll through all the other information. There must be a menu that provides links to all information. This can be done in a Powerpoint-type slide show or by making a set of webpages. What you choose to use is up to you. Which do feel most comfortable with? Which lets you do the job in the way that is most suitable for the purpose and audience?	6
Paper publications cover letters, leaflets, posters and reports. You will need to produce at least one of these for your DiDA project. When planning your publication, always keep in mind the target audience and purpose of the publication. The D201 project is split into the production of two types of publications - paper-based and screen-based. You will need to take different approaches for each publication, but it is crucial to follow a suitable format and layout for each. It is also important to ensure each publication is suitable for the intended purpose and audience. Don't worry about using all the advanced features of the software you are using. The exam board is more interested in evidence showing you have thought about what you are doing and produced a suitable solution. It is better to spend time testing your publication with a member of the intended audience and then improving it, than trying to make your project look 'flash'. You MUST produce the documents that are listed in the SPB. If a document is missed out, you will lose all nine marks! It is better to complete all the documents to a decent standard than to have one or two good ones and a few poor ones. Plan your time carefully and make sure you get all the publications made to the best of your ability. As you work through the various publications, keep coming back to the word - SOAP - a Sense Of Audience and Purpose Paper publications include posters, leaflets, newsletters and adverts	6
The standard layout for a business letter is shown below. It is probably best to use a Word Processor for the letter, but you could also use a Desktop Publishing Programme. You don't have to stick to exactly this format, but there is little to gain from doing much more than the basic version. The important thing is that the letter is fit for purpose. Focus on making sure the content of the letter is correct, rather than spending time putting in fancy graphics. Make sure your letter meets the purpose outlined in the SPB. Use a suitable font, nothing fancy, and definitely not a joined-up hand writing font. Use a suitable form of language. If it's a business letter, use formal, business-like language. Ask your English teacher to have a look at the letter and to check it for spelling, grammar and general content. Remember to ask them if they think it is SOAP - Suitable Of Audience and Purpose	6
Leaflets and newsletters are probably best tackled using a desktop publishing program such as Publisher. This will give you greater control over the layout than a Word Processor program like Word. Start by reading the SPB carefully and noting exactly what you need to produce. Keep coming back to this to make sure you have all the necessary sections. Once you are sure you have a good idea of what you want to produce, start collecting all the images you want to include. Make sure you are not breaking any copyright legislation and be sure to include the sources of the images in your acknowledgements section. Always leave time to test your publication with people who can give you sensible feedback. This could be a teacher or parent, if the publication is aimed at adults, or a classmate or younger brother/sister if the publication is aimed at children. Donâ€™t just make a note of the comments you get, act on them and make your publication as good as possible.	6
There are lots of different ways to produce a poster, but before you start using a package, make sure it is capable of printing out in the size needed for the SPB â€“ eg can it print A3 paper? Again it is best to start by re-reading the project brief and noting down exactly what you need to do. Donâ€™t get drawn in to designing the poster to appeal to your tastes â€“ unless you are in the target audience. The key difference between a poster and other paper-based documents is that posters must work over a greater distance. Do some research and look at posters in the real world. Which ones work the best? What is it about them that makes them work? What sort of graphics and text to do they use? A person walking past a wall covered in billboard posters. Posters have large text advertising music. Plan your poster carefully before you start. Collect all the graphics and text you will need and then start to put the whole thing together. Use a desktop publisher program such as Microsoft Publisher, but there are a lot of alternative ways of producing an effective poster. Again, it is really important to test your poster with the target audience and ensure that the whole thing is suitable for purpose.	6
It is likely that you will have to write a report on a survey that you carry out. This publication is probably best dealt with using a word processor. The SPB will tell you exactly what the purpose of the report is and exactly what audience you are writing for. It is likely that you will have to use a formal sort of language and a mature and serious layout. Make sure you include page numbers on the footer of pages. Check the Bitesize DiDA section on Headers and Footers for instructions.	6
Database reports need to be prepared in whichever database program you are using for the project (probably Microsoft Access). For instructions on producing database reports, have a look at Bitesize DiDA: Database reports . Take the same approach as you do with all your other documents and make sure reports are fit for purpose and suitable for the audience. Start by looking at them and seeing if they are easy to read â€“ often you will need to change the alignment [alignment: objects and text can be aligned left, right, centred or justified ], colour and size. You may also need to add some text to explain what the report shows. In Design View, click on the Aa button. Draw out a box and type in text explaining what the report shows and if you have any recommendations on actions to take.	6

You should already have read the notes on Questionnaires before starting this section. After you've collected your data, you will need to display your results using charts and graphs. The final part of your survey will then be to interpret the data and explain any patterns and trends. When you have collected all your survey data, you will need to type it into the spreadsheet before you can analyse it. In the example below, the questions have been put across the top and each person's answer has gone into a new row. The results are from a survey of parents about their children's internet and TV use. It may be easier to enter the data if you make a form. Put the questions along the top row, then click Data and then Form	6
How concerned are you about your childâ€™s use of the internet (0 not worried at all, 5 extremely worried)? The average value for this was 3.88. Here is a graph showing the information. Pie chart showing how worried parents are by their children's internet use The most common answer given was 5 â€“ extremely concerned. This shows that many parents are really concerned about the effects of the internet on children. More than three quarters of those surveyed were quite concerned. This gives the basic facts from the questionnaire, and then adds some description to what the data shows. Sometimes this may be as much as you can do, but do try to look carefully and come up with reasons for the data and try to draw some conclusions.	6
The most common answer given was 5 â€“ extremely concerned. This shows that many parents are really concerned about the effects of the internet on children. More than three quarters of those surveyed were quite concerned. Pie chart showing how worried parents are by their children's internet use When I looked at the data more carefully, I found that of the 23 people who said they were extremely concerned about their childrenâ€™s use of the internet, 18 were the parents of teenage girls who used chat rooms regularly. Part of the reason parents were so worried was because of the reports of a girl being abducted in the local area after using a chat room. It should also be noted that less than 20 per cent of those surveyed used any sort of web filtering or reporting system and had no idea what their children were using the internet for. This fact might add to their concerns. The school could offer parents a session on safe use of the internet and show how easy it is to install software that controls and logs access to the internet. They could also add a page to the website offering further advice and links. This gives the basic facts from the questionnaire, and then adds some description of what the data shows. It then goes on to interpret the meaning of the data and explore the factors influencing the data. Finally, there is a paragraph that includes some recommendations based on the findings of the report.	6
Once you have your data in a spreadsheet, you can start to analyse it and produce your report. It is really important to read through the SPB [SPB: Summative Project Brief - the project brief set by Edexcel and the means by which your attainment is assessed. ] and to understand the purpose and audience for the questionnaire report. In your spreadsheet, you should leave all the raw data [raw data: data which has not been processed for use ] on a separate sheet called results. Go to Insert [insert: usually located on the main menu located at the top of the page. ], then Worksheet to create new worksheet pages. Each graph or chart you create should be on a separate worksheet. You can change the name of worksheets by double clicking on the tabs at the bottom. Right click on the tabs to rename, change colour or insert a new worksheet	6
There are several different statistical techniques you can use to analyse your results once they have been entered into a spreadsheet. If the answer was a number, you could calculate the average using the average function. The forumale = Average (C2:C13) has been entered into cell D2. You can use the functions max [max: a function which is used to determine the highest value within a specified range ] and min [min: a function which is used to determine the lowest value within a specified range ] to get the highest and lowest values in a block of cells. You can get the range by using a formula that takes the min away from the max. The range is the difference between the minimum (lowest) and maximum (highest) numbers in a list. Calculate the range by using a formula that takes the min away from the max. The range is the difference between the maximum and minumum value.	6
The easiest way to get the data ready for the charts is to use the Countif function. For more instructions about creating charts and graphs, visit the Bitesize DiDA: Spreadsheets section. Donâ€™t go overboard with colours and patterns when making graphs. Just make sure that every graph is readable. It is OK to use colours because your report will be viewed on screen in your eportfolio. You do not have to make graphs and charts readable in black and white. Sometimes, your graphs will not work well if you use categories like 0,1,2,3,4,5. The spreadsheet interprets them a bit differently and your graphs come out looking wrong. One way to get around this is to use the words instead, ie zero, one, two, three, four, five. Make sure your graphs have sensible titles and legends (labels). Always check this, look carefully and change them if necessary. It is usually easiest to choose the option to insert the chart as a new sheet. This will make it easier when it comes to copying and pasting the graphs into your survey report. Test your graphs to make sure they make sense. Again, it is a good idea to ask a maths or science teacher if they have any comments or suggestions â€“ listen to them carefully â€“ they are experts!	6
How concerned are you about your childâ€™s use of the internet (0 not worried at all, 5 extremely worried)? The average value for this was 3.88. Here is a graph showing the information. Pie chart showing how worried parents are by their children's internet use This gives the basic facts from the questionnaire, but there is no analysis or interpretation of the information. It is OK as a starting point, but you can produce a much better report with only a little bit more work.	6
Before setting to work on your questions, check the list below of things to avoid. Also, avoid questions that could be interpreted [interpreted: the way something is understood ] in several different ways. Quantifiers such as â€˜fewâ€™, â€˜someâ€™, â€˜manyâ€™ and â€˜usuallyâ€™ can be interpreted differently by different respondents. Therefore, great care must be taken when using such words or, alternatively, avoid using them. Are you ready to start writing your questionnaire? First, have a go at the interactive activity below to see if you can identify a good, poor or biased questionnaire question.	6
This type of question will give you clear results that are easy to convert into statistics. An example of a yes/no question Tick boxes give people a limited choice of answers. This makes interpreting results easier, but you must check that all possible answers are included in the tick boxes. One word answers are given. This type of question can be used if it's difficult to predict all the possible different answers. This type of question is useful for finding out people's opinions about something. However, sentence answers can be difficult to analyse.	6
Carefully select your sample group to ensure you collect a generalised view of the population you're researching. Selecting a suitable sample size will not necessarily be exactly representative of the whole group because all sample participants are not the same. Sampling [sampling: the number of subjects included in the study ] choices are probably more important than the overall number of people you question. It is essential to give your survey to the right people. If you are supposed to find out what parents think about something, make sure you give your survey to parents! Read the SPB [SPB: Summative Project Brief - the project brief set by Edexcel and the means by which your attainment is assessed. ] carefully to make sure you know what you have to do. Consider what type of sampling you intend to do. Try to make sure your questionnaire is representative. If you are supposed to be finding out what young people think about something, make sure you ask roughly equal numbers of boys and girls. If you ask just boys, your survey results will be inaccurate. For a more detailed description of sampling techniques, take a look at GCSE Bitesize Maths: Data sampling	6
Each box in the spreadsheet is called a cell. Each cell has its own reference label, which is named by the column and row that intercept to form the cell. Look at the spreadsheet below. The shaded cell is where column B and row 3 meet. This cellâ€™s reference is B3. Use the activity below to practise labelling cells.	6
Below is a spreadsheet showing the cost of computer equipment from three shops. You might want to find out how much a computer and printer from Shop 1 would cost. To do this, you need to use a simple addition formula. You need to type this in as = B2+D2 All formulae in spreadsheets need to begin with the = sign. This tells the cell to expect a formulae. Other simple formulae you should know are listed in the table below.	6
Some searches can produce hundreds of results pages linking to websites that are not relevant to your search. To avoid this happening, be careful when choosing your search words. The more specific your words are, the better your search results will be. Follow the tips below to improve your search results. Use quotation marks to search for a phrase of several words together. Avoid using words that are not relevant in your searches. Including words like 'how, and, in, to or as' in a search will give a list of irrelevant search results. Only use the names of people, places or things that you want to find. Only include the important words - Oxford museums Use the + sign to search for webpages with more than one key word. Use the + sign to search for webpages with more than one key word. Adding a plus to your search will ensure that all your results include the key words. Include a -sign against words you don't want included in search results Put a - sign in front of any words that you don't want to be included in your search results. For example, you might want to search for information about the place Wimbledon, but not not about tennis. To practise more searching techniques [searching techniques: techniques which make searching for information on the Internet easier ], visit BBC Webwise.	6
Some search engines, eg Google allow you to search for images using key words. You can use exactly the same search techniques used for searching for websites. You must remember that if you use images that are owned by other people, you could be breaking copyright lawcopyright law: The law which makes it illegal for a person to copy an item such as a magazine article, a photo or a CD without the agreement of the copyright owner.. For more information on copyright, visit Bitesize DiDA: Image copyright. Many websites offer free use of images and photographs for students. BBC Schools allow students to use images from the BBC Schools website for educational purposes. Check the BBC Schools Copyright page for more information. Below is a list of websites that offer free images.	6
Statistical information is based on a study of the number of times something happens or is present. Often, the government carries out large research projects to collect information about people and their lives. These results are often available on the internet and can be used in your DiDA research project. Statistics can be used to back up or prove a point. For example, if you wanted to say that the village you live in has a high crime rate, you could prove this by quoting statistics for the number of crimes committed in a year. In the UK, the census is a massive survey sent to every household in the country. A census is carried out every ten years and is the main source of statistics on income, housing, health and employment. It's important to use accurate statistics in your DiDA project. Make sure you use statistics from an official website and, if possible, compare figures with other sources. Listed below are some useful websites providing statistics. Don't forget to include the source of your statistics in the bibiography.	6
Most websites found on the internet don't belong to companies or organisations. Many people publish websites as a hobby or for political reasons. It's often quite easy to spot an unofficial website [unofficial website: a site that is not produced by or belongs to an 'official' company or organisation ]. You can often spot whether a website is unofficial by looking at its address. The more you use the web, the more familiar you'll become with different URLs. You can usually tell that a website is produced by an unofficial source just by looking at the website design. Most websites include a 'last updated' date. Always check this. Some websites haven't been updated for years and information may be completely out of date. Daily news - last updated 04/07/2003 Some unofficial websites can be useful for finding out people's opinions. Websites about hobbies, music and travel often provide valuable advice and opinions about everything from restaurant to gig reviews.	6
You'll find that each time you use the internet, you will visit many different websites. Some you will only look at briefly and decide it's not what you were looking for, other times you will find valuable websites that you will want to visit regularly throughout the DiDA course. Don't risk losing the web address of a really useful website. If you find a useful website, make sure you add it to your list of favourites. Remember to organise your favourites into folders. You could have a folder for each of your GCSE subjects and sub folders for topics. If you forget to add a useful website to your favourites, use the History button to find a website again.	6
Website designs vary from basic ones set up by users as a hobby to sophisticated designs that represent large international companies. Before designing a website, you should take a look at other websites to help you decide how your webpages should look. You should also read the project brief carefully. Make sure you do exactly what the examiners want. There is no point in doing any more - if they say five pages, only do five pages. Normally, on a website there is a title bar at the top, a menu on the left and then the main information appears in the big space on the right. Stick to a simple, clear page layout Try to avoid flashy things like sound, scrolling banners and animated text/graphics. These might look 'cool' to you, but, unless they are really suitable for the purpose and audience, they are more likely to lose you marks than earn you marks.	6
Images on websites can improve the look and style of the page. However, you must be careful to save images in the correct format. The two main formats for web images are gif and jpg. These are used for images that have only a few colours, such as line drawings, text and logos. These are used for images or photographs that include details and more colours. If you save a photo or graphic in the incorrect format, how the image looks will be affected. Look at the images below. When the fish photo is saved in a gif format, colours and details are lost. When the bitesize graphic is saved incorrectly as a jpg, unwanted colours appear and the looks less sharp. Look closely at the orange background - the image looks speckled. Look closely at the orange background - the image looks speckled.	6
Cropping allows you to select the part of the image you want to show. It's likely that you may take a photograph or find an image that is too big and you only want to use one part of the image. To crop an image, you can use image editing software such as Word, Photoshop or Paintshop. 1. Crop this image to include only the penguin. 2. Select the crop tool in a picture editing package. 3. Use the crop tool to outline the part of the image you want to keep. Adjust the size of the area to be cropped by dragging on the boxes on the selection border. 4. To crop the image, press the return key on your keyboard or double click in the centre of the selected area of the image.	6
The examiners will be looking for a consistent house style throughout each publication you produce. A good example of this can be seen on the BBC GCSE Bitesize website. GCSE Bitesize uses the same font, sizes and layout throughout the site. This gives a much more professional impression than constantly chopping and changing between different pages. Ideally, you should come up with a few ideas for fonts, layouts and colour schemes and then test them on members of your target audience. Remember to include details of this testing when writing your reviews and evaluations. Always remember the publication has to appeal to your target audience! Take a look at the image below. It's a classic example of a badly designed website! Make sure you avoid using garish colours and patterned backgrounds.	6
It is crucial to thoroughly test your presentations and websites, as well as all the publications you produce. First, check that all the links work. It is best to copy the website or presentation onto another device (like a memory stick or CD) and try it out away from the school network - this will show if you have used absolute hyperlinks by mistake. All the links must work before you submit your work for marking and moderation. Secondly, test your publication with members of the target audience. One good way of doing this is to prepare a checklist for the reviewer to fill in. Finally, write the results of your tests in the review section of your eportfolio. Remember to say how well your publication meets the needs of the audience and include ideas on how it can be improved.	6
Tables are really useful for organising and displaying information. Most word processing packages allow you to insert tables into your document. You then need to enter the number of rows and the number of columns you would like your table to have. Remember that rows go across the page, and columns go down the page. The table will then appear in your word processing document. A table with three columns and two rows.	6
This Revision Bite explores the different drama mediums used in drama exploration. You'll use several of these strategies for your portfolio work in Drama Exploration Unit 1 and Drama Exploration Unit 2. There are drama medium video examples and activities throughout this Revision Bite. Student in costume and make-up Costume can be modern clothes, period costume or a fantasy outfit. You may want to wear full costume, or perhaps just wear black, with indications of character as an extra feature. For example, a hat, shawl or jacket could signify character. Sometimes, in stylised drama, the items of costume are exaggerated - so a jacket could be in very bright colours. Masks may be single colour, painted, full-face or half-face. They are usually used in stylised work to indicate non-human characters - for example in a Greek chorus, in 'Animal Farm', or in a play with demons. Make-up functions in different ways. Sometimes it's used to 'age' an actor, or it may indicate a fantasy character such as a fairy in 'A Midsummer Night's Dream'. At other times it can alter the gender of a character, or communicate a different style of theatre, eg Kabuki [kabuki: A style of theatre, popular in Japan, often featuring elaborate costumes, music and dancing ]. Use the dressing room activity to design and print costumes for your character. Remember to check out the costume gallery and the hats, wigs, masks and make-up gallery.	6
As well as helping the actors to be seen, lighting can also indicate the time of day, or a place, and can focus audience attention on a character. Spot - has a hard-edged effect, used to light characters or elements on the stage. Coloured filters can be used with this lamp. Fresnel - used for a softer edged effect, with a diffusing lens in front of the lamp. It's useful for good overall light, when used with others. Coloured filters can be used with this lamp. Flood - produces a clear wide-angled light, but there is little control over the spread of the light. Coloured filters can be used with this lamp. Strobe - a flashing light, used for special effects. Often used to give the effect of old movies. Produces a jerky effect on the movements of actors when used on its own.	6
You may use very simple or very detailed sets and props. Stage sets help create the background to a drama, but it's usually best to keep them simple. Shakespeare's stage used little in the way of set, and the modern trend is also to keep things low-key. Props are the items that are held or used by an actor in a scene to make it more realistic. These are also best kept to the minimum. A briefcase might be enough to portray a businessman, without using a phone as well, or a hat might signify one character when it's on and a different character when it's off. Hint - if you use props in your drama, start working with them as soon as you can. Props can slow down the action at times, and you'll need lots of practise if you want a slick pace.	6
The use of climax and anti-climax (the building and releasing of tension) in a drama is crucial, as it creates a sense of expectation in the audience. We can become incredibly tense as we wait to see what's going to happen in a play, and then we're relieved when things turn out well. It all adds to an interesting experience. Climax building up in 'Eastenders' For example, will the guard notice that the escape tunnel entrance is partly uncovered? If the action is slowed down - perhaps because he sits down and talks for a while - the tension rises as we watch him. If the guard leaves without noticing the tunnel, the tension releases and we sigh with relief. It's up to the director of a drama to create the climax and anti-climax that make sure this happens.	6
The use of contrast in drama productions - eg stillness contrasted with activity, or silence contrasted with noise - is a useful way to focus the audience's attention. A drama being played with no change of pace or rhythm doesn't usually hold our interest, but most can be brought to life with the use of contrasting sights and sounds. An example of such contrast could be in a courtroom drama. At first there's the hustle and bustle of bringing in the prisoner, with everyone scurrying around trying to see and hear the judge's pronouncement. Then there's the sound of the gavel banging on his desk - and the resulting quiet before he pronounces the sentence. The audience can't fail to be interested!	6
The way an actor plays a role, using his/her acting skills to create a character in a drama, is known as characterisation. Think about how we describe someone. Of course everyone looks a bit different, but a person's character can be shown in many ways, and this is where the actor's skill comes in. You can show a character in the way they walk and move (body language [body language: The non-verbal way in which a person communicates their physical and mental state through using facial expressions, gesture and posture ]), in the way they speak (vocal qualities) and in their reaction to events in the drama. When creating a character we may use techniques such as hot-seating [hot-seating: To question an individual while they remain in character ] to develop the role, but we also need to think about these other aspects of presenting the character so they can 'come alive' within the drama.

Thought-tracking helps inform an audience about a character. Sometimes in daily life we would like to know what someone thinks at important moments. We really want to know how people have been affected by a situation. When we know more of what they are feeling, we understand them better. In drama, too, when we know more of what a character thinks or feels, the drama is deepened and the audience becomes more involved.

Role-play is what you do when you're pretending to be another person and using your imagination to speak, think and even feel like that character. If you don't pretend to be someone else while acting in a drama, then the audience will see only 'you' and not the character you are meant to be portraying. They will only see 'you' in the situations that are described. If you make the role-play realistic and believable, then the audience will be more likely to 'suspend their disbelief' (forget that they're watching a drama, and feel personally involved). Play role-play with thought-tracking video example Watch the video example by clicking on the link. Note: this link will open in a new browser window.	6
Hot-seating is a way of developing (or deepening) character. If you are in the hot-seat you answer questions from others in the group while you are 'in role'. The characters will seem more realistic if you feel you really 'know' them. It is easier to be spontaneous and believable if you have carefully explored a character in your drama during the hot-seating process. Play hot-seating with cross-cutting video example Watch the video example by clicking on the link. Note: this link will open in a new browser window.	6
Forum theatre is a technique you can use while acting out a scene. The group watching is encouraged to stop the action when they think it necessary, to suggest a different action. At other times, the actors themselves can stop the action, and ask for help. Sometimes someone else can step in and take over a role - or even introduce a new one. Sometimes it is hard, when devising drama, to imagine what a character might do or say at a particular moment. If you stop the drama when in role, and ask for help from your group, someone will probably give you a good idea of what to do or say next. They might also offer to take over the role to try out their idea - or even join the scene as another character altogether, to take things in a new direction.

Browse through this gallery to see costume examples from throughout the ages - if you need to think about a costume for your character, you'll find plenty of ideas here. This gallery will be especially useful if you're taking the 'Performance Support: Costume Design' option for Paper 2. Don't forget to browse through the Hats, wigs and masks gallery and the Character gallery for more costume inspiration. A toga, as worn in Roman times The toga was a garment worn by the by male citizens of Ancient Rome (625 BC to AD 476 ). Women wore stolas - a type of pleated dress. The toga was usually worn over an undergarment made from linen. The toga was usually made of wool. You could wear this type of costume in any classical tragedy.	6
Family, with children wearing gas mask boxes Clothing through the war era was practical, and affected by the rationing system. New clothes were often just re-fashioned from old clothes, and there were shortages of luxurious materials such as silk. Women would often wear a simple knee-length dress or blouse and skirt. Mackintosh coats were popular outdoor items, and some women would wear a matching tailored suit jacket outdoors. Men continued to wear jackets and ties as a matter of routine, although sometimes with casual trousers, not necessarily matching suit trousers. Jumpers, vests and polo-neck shirts were popular for less formal wear.	6
Costume sketch from Dr. Who series Costume sketch from Dr. Who series Characters from Dr. Who Character from Dr. Who Futuristic and sci-fi costumes give you a lot of scope for design. You could create a costume which is highly unusual by today's standards, or just exaggerate a popular style of today's fashion. Fantasy costumes tend to be based on period clothing - witches, for example, often wear the sort of clothes women might have worn in mediaeval times.	6
Costume of a geisha, close-up Costume of a geisha, full-length If your play is based in Japan, you might want a costume for a traditional geisha - a female Japanese entertainer. They wear white make-up on their face, with bright red lips. A geisha always wears a kimono (a traditional full-length robe). The traditional dress for an Indian woman is a sari - a large piece of cloth that can be wrapped around the body in various styles. The most common style of wearing a sari is wrapped around the waist, with one end draped over the shoulder. Most women wear a short-sleeved blouse underneath. Traditional clothing for Indian men includes a knee-length (or longer) shirt (note women may also wear these). It's usually worn over loose trousers. Traditional african dress, worn in a variety of ways Traditional African costume varies widely across the continent, although there are some similarities. Tunics or kaftans (long shirts, usually to the floor) are popular clothing for men, worn with loose trousers. Women may wear toga-inspired garments, wrapped around their bodies. Bright coloured fabrics and beaded jewellery are popular. African warriors sometimes wear fantastically decorated costumes, and paint their bodies.	6
The Tudor period (1485-1603) was a time in English history that remains strong in the popular imagination to this day. Two of the most famous Tudors, often recreated in drama today, are Queen Elizabeth I and her father Henry VIII. Rather like today, the wealthy people of the period would wear clothes made from luxurious materials such as silk, and bright colours. The middle-classes would wear clothes of a similar style but usually made from cheaper materials, such as wool and linen. Poorer people would wear simple clothes made from wool - tunic and trousers for men, and a long dress (worn with an apron on top) for women. Well-to-doTudor women wore hooped skirts with padded hips, which reached to the floor. Men wore padded breeches with stockings - not trousers. Fur was a popular trim among the wealthy. One of the most recognised items of clothing from the late Tudor period is the ruff - a collar of lace worn around the neck. Some wealthy people wore enormous ruffs to show off their wealth.	6
The following images are from the BBC adaptation of Jane Austen's 'Pride and Prejudice'. The book was first published in 1813. In the later 18th century women adopted a more loosely fitting dress, known as the chemise, which was inspired by the fashions of ancient Greece and Rome. The dresses were often made of muslin, in plain colours, with a high waistline. This trend continued throughout the early 19th century. For men, knee-length breeches were replaced by ankle-length trousers, and suits became more fashionable. Clothing among the wealthy classes during this period became far less flamboyant in style and colour than they had been previously.	6
Small hat, as worn in the late 19th century Decorated hat, as worn in the late 19th century Bonnet as worn in the early 19th-century Top hat as worn in the 19th-century In the 1860s, bowler hats became popular among men. In the 1870s, the fashion for women's dresses was to be flatter than before at the front, and to be padded out at the back - the 'bustle' was invented to help create this effect.	6

The toga was usually worn over an undergarment made from linen. The toga was usually made of wool. You could wear this type of costume in any classical tragedy. The Middle Ages (350AD - 1450AD), sometimes called Mediaeval times, refers to the period of history in Europe from the 11th to the 13th centuries. In this period most people wore undergarments made of linen, and outer garments of heavy wool, in natural colours. Only the wealthy could afford brighter colours such as red. The Tudor period (1485-1603) was a time in English history that remains strong in the popular imagination to this day. Two of the most famous Tudors, often recreated in drama today, are Queen Elizabeth I and her father Henry VIII. Rather like today, the wealthy people of the period would wear clothes made from luxurious materials such as silk, and bright colours.

One of the most recognised items of clothing from the late Tudor period is the ruff - a collar of lace worn around the neck. Some wealthy people wore enormous ruffs to show off their wealth. These images show the clothes worn for the BBC production 'The Virgin Queen' about Queen Elizabeth I. Notice how the clothes from her early life are simpler than those she wore later on. Wealthy women of the 18th century still wore corsets to help shape their clothes, and hooped dresses were still popular, but the dresses were more low-cut than previously. Wealthy men continued to wear three-quarter-length coats and breeches. Wigs, high-heeled shoes (worn by men and women) and elaborate embroidery were big trends of the early 18th century, but they disappeared towards the end of the period.

For men, knee-length breeches were replaced by ankle-length trousers, and suits became more fashionable. Clothing among the wealthy classes during this period became far less flamboyant in style and colour than they had been previously. For women, corsets and hooped skirts reappeared early in the 19th century. A new invention, called the crinoline, offered women an alternative to stiffened petticoats for holding out their skirts. Suits continued popular with men, and fine tailoring became important for those in the higher classes. Small hat, as worn in the late 19th century Decorated hat, as worn in the late 19th century Bonnet as worn in the early 19th-century Top hat as worn in the 19th-century In the 1860s, bowler hats became popular among men.

Women's evening wear The most radical change in style for women's clothing happened throughout the 1920s. Hems rose, waistlines dropped, corsets disappeared and elaborate bead work became popular on dresses. Middle-class men still wore suits, ties and waistcoats during the day, and the better-off would often change into a formal suit for dinner in the evening. Working men would wear suits on high days and holidays. Family, with children wearing gas mask boxes Clothing through the war era was practical, and affected by the rationing system.

Jumpers, vests and polo-neck shirts were popular for less formal wear. A full-skirted dress, with netting under the skirt, as worn in the 1950s Clothing did not change a great deal through the 1950s, although there were two major trends. For women, a full skirt with netting became fashionable, while the Teddy Boy look became popular with young men. The look consisted of tight fitting jeans/trousers (sometimes called drainpipes), a long smart jacket and a thin tie. These young men often wore their hair in a quiff (in homage to Elvis Presley). A woman in a mini-skirt The 1960s saw the introduction of the mini-skirt - a very short thigh-length skirt. Patterns and bold colours became popular for fabric. This period also saw the introduction of the hippy - often a young middle-class person in favour of colourful flowing clothes, peace and free love. Maxi-dress, as worn in the 1970s Flares and platform shoes, as worn in the 1970s In the 1970s men and women wore trousers (called flares) that were wide at the ankle, shirts with wide collars and platform shoes. Women often wore full-length skirts (maxi-skirts). Here are some military costumes from throughout the ages.

Facial expressions are important in drama. They can convey emotions, develop the story and communicate the feelings and thoughts of the characters to the audience. Actors may use any combination of facial expression, gestures, movement and props to create the effect they want. Browse through this gallery to see some expressions used in drama. Actors can show happiness by smiling, laughing and making gestures such as hugging each other. Actors can show sadness in a drama by crying, looking thoughtful, or using comforting gestures with each other. Actors can show emotional pain and grief by crying, shouting in anguish, or holding their head in their hands. They can show physical pain by facial expressions and gestures. Actors can show shock and horror by using facial expressions such as raised eyebrows, an open mouth and gestures such as throwing their arms up in the air. Showing shock, comedy style Actors can use similar, but less exaggerated, versions of the gestures of shock and horror when they want to show surprise only. Showing surprise, comedy style Actors can convey anger and aggression by facial expressions and by aggressive gestures towards the camera or other characters. Showing physical aggression, comedy style Actors can communicate insanity by looking dishevelled, adopting a wide-eyed stare, or brandishing weapons menacingly . Actors can show worry through facial expressions and gestures such as biting their nails. Actors often create a sense of excitement or anticipation by looking off-stage, sometimes open-mouthed. Showing anticipation by looking off-stage Actors can purse their lips, furrow their brow and focus intently on what they are doing to convey concentration. When actors need to reflect on-stage about dramatic events, they can show a thoughtful mood by their facial expression, by gestures such as resting their face on their hands, or by looking into the distance. Actors can show exasperation through facial expressions, through jumping up and down, or by use of props. Actors can grab food or other props hungrily, and seem to gobble it down, to convey greed.	6

There are lots of different styles of make-up - if you use make-up for your drama, it will depend on the theme and style you're planning. Look through this page for inspiration. When you're on stage, performing under hot bright lights, you should wear some basic make-up, whether you're a boy or a girl! Heavy foundation is useful for preventing the skin from looking washed-out under the lights, and face powder helps keep shine to a minimum. You may also want to use eyeliner to define the eyes. White face powder was popular in the 16th-18th centuries, partly to cover up bad skin caused by lack of washing.

When you're devising drama, you'll need to think about how to stage your performance, and what type of stage to use. You'll also need to think about stage directions for each character in your drama. This Revision Bite defines the various types of stages, and different areas of the stage. A stage where the audience sits on one side only is called a proscenium stage (you might know this as end-on staging). The audience faces one side of the stage directly, and normally sits at a lower height. An in-the-round stage is positioned at the centre of the audience - ie there is audience around the whole stage. This type of stage creates quite an intimate atmosphere, and is good for drama that needs audience involvement. A stage where the audience sits on two sides is called a traverse stage. Again, this type of stage is good for creating an intimate atmosphere.	6
If you've chosen Option b: Performance Support for Paper 2, you'll need to choose an area of theatre-craft to work in. Being a designer involves plenty of creative energy, so do pick something you're passionate about. In this Revision Bite you'll find lots of tips and ideas for each of the performance support options available. With each of these you need to work closely with the group performing the drama. It's important you're in touch with their ideas about what what they want their drama to show. At first you'll be listening and perhaps offering ideas. Do take notes, so you can chart the thinking of the group as it develops. It would be good to take photographs of the group working at various stages, as these will show what was happening while you worked out your design. Research is important. You may have to research historical aspects of the subject, and look at fashion and clothing. Or you may need to look at living conditions in order to create the right light effects - would a hovel be dark, would a Victorian mansion be candle or gas-lit? Or you may want to create some sound tapes to represent traffic noise or rural sounds. The important thing is always to refer to the script [script: The text of a play or drama production - usually the script will give suggestions for the setting of the scene and contain direction for the characters ]. The starting point for all your work is the script, and everything you do should support the performance.	6
When thinking about costumes in a drama, your starting point should be the script or devised work. This should be in your mind at all times - you are designing for the play, and your work should support the piece. Watch what the actors have to do during the drama. If there's lots of action, their clothes must be easy to move in. For quick costume changes, you'll need easy fastenings. Research the era of the drama, or research fantasy costumes if your drama's a fantasy. Make full use of libraries and the internet to find examples of all sorts of costumes - you could start with the costume and character galleries in this section for ideas and references. Costume sketch for a character from the programme 'Dr Who'. Note the annotations and fabric sample attached. If the lighting designer is using coloured gels, experiment with how colours are affected by them. Red, for example, under red lights, looks washed out, while under blue lights it can look almost black. So choose your colours with care!

First make sure your lighting rig and controls are at least the minimum requirements of the examination. Check with your teacher if you're not sure. When thinking about lighting, your starting point should be the script or devised work. This should be in your mind at all times - you're designing lighting for the play and what you do should support the piece. Find out what the actors plan to do during the drama. They might need areas of the stage lit separately, or sidelights for a particular scene or moment, or single spots to highlight particular characters. Also remember to plan for positioning, use of barn doors [barn door: A lighting device that reduces a light beam and reduces stray scatter light ], gobos [gobo: A lighting device that creates patterns of projected light on the stage ], filters etc. Research the era the drama is set in. Make full use of libraries and the internet to find examples of what life was like at the time. Your drama may be set in a time when people used oil lamps, for example, and you should work out how to create this type of light. Create a slideshow presentation with the major stages of your work outlined. This is a good way to organise your thinking, and you can practice your timing. To learn more about making a slideshow presentation, check out the Presentations Revision Bite from the Bitesize DiDA section. Keep your notebooks ready for the examiner, so you can show your designs and images not used in the slideshow. Why not mark your best pages? Be prepared to show at least two lighting states and a good transition between the two, explaining what effect you intended to create.	6
Your starting point should be the script or devised work. This should be in your mind at all times - you're designing masks for the play and what you do should support the piece. When thinking about masks, find out what the actors are doing during the drama. Their character needs to be shown in the mask in some way. And if the character removes the mask during the performance, this will also affect your design. Make full use of your library and the internet to find examples of masks that have been designed for different styles of performance. You could start with the mask page from the galleries section for some ideas and references. Create a slideshow presentation with the major stages of your work outlined.

When thinking about make-up, your starting point should be the script or devised work. This should be in your mind at all times - you're designing make-up for the play, and what you do should support the piece. Find out what the actor you are designing for actually does in the drama. Their character needs to be shown in their make-up. Make full use of your school/local library and the internet to obtain examples of make-up types and characters from other performances. A historical character and a modern character will need very different styles of make-up. You could start with the make-up page from the galleries section for some ideas and references.

This should be in your mind at all times - you're designing a set for the play, and what you do should support the piece. Find out what the actors you're designing for actually do in the drama. Where do they walk, sit, stand? Do they use areas of the stage separately? Will they be using levels? Discuss how the group will use the stage area. Research the era in which the drama is set. Use your library and the internet to find examples of what life was like at the time. Discuss with the actors what the important elements of the piece are, so that your design reflects these.

When thinking about sound design, your starting point should be the script or devised work. This should be in your mind at all times - you're designing the sound effects for the play, and what you do should support the piece. Find out what the actors are going to be doing in the drama. Do they need to answer a phone, for example? It can be hard to start and stop a phone on a tape or CD, so do practice with the actor.Question the group members carefully about what sounds are needed for the piece. You'll need to create them yourself, or find CDs, tapes or sound files to use. And you might need some music for the start and finish. Research the era in which the drama is to be set if the work is not fantasy. Use the library and the internet to obtain examples of what life was like at the time. For example, if the piece is set during the First World War, you'll need sound effects that link to the era. If you're working on a fantasy drama, you'll need sound that's not connected with any particular era. Think about creating a slideshow presentation with the major stages of your work outlined. This is a good way to organise your thinking, and you can practice to make sure that your timing is right.

The Selfish Driver doesn't see or hear anyone else on the road, and takes more than their share of the space. This sort of behaviour stops others from feeling involved. The others realise their ideas will not be noticed or used, and they stop bothering to think. In this way the group is weakened. The Sleepy Passenger is a different kind of drain. They don't contribute much to the drama process and they have to be told what to do.	6
In Unit 1, you may submit all or part of your script in your portfolio. The script will need to be well annotated to get good marks. Also, in your drama performance work, annotations in your script will help you perform well. In this Revision Bite, you'll learn the basics of script annotation. To annotate means to add explanation and notes. You can annotate lots of things - a book, an image, an artefact - but annotation is used most often on scripts. Annotations help actors perform your scene exactly how you imagined it. Your annotations may start as simple one word notes, but after several rehearsals, you may need to write more detail.	6
The example below shows the script with annotations. Colonel Shaw is seated at his desk. The stage contains a desk, DSL (down stage left), at which Colonel Shaw sits. He has a worried expression and is tapping the top of the desk with a pencil. A knocking sound is followed by the entrance of Private Halliwell. Pt Halliwell: (Saluting) You wanted to see me, Sir? Halliwell approaches the desk and salutes, then stands to attention before speaking. His voice is clipped and neutral. Col Shaw: Yes, Halliwell. I want your account of what happened in the guardroom. Col Shaw looks up at Halliwell, hands folded on the top of the desk. Pt Halliwell: (Pause) Well, Sir, I went on duty at 16.00 hours, and they had the prisoner tied to a chair, Sir. (Silence) At this, Shaw looks down to his hands. When Halliwell becomes silent he looks up again, and leans forward slightly before speaking. Col Shaw: Go on, Halliwell. Pt Halliwell: Well, Sir, they ... they ... had the dog on a leash, Sir, and it was ... it was ... (He falters) Halliwell clears his throat before speaking, clearly nervous. Col Shaw: Please carry on, Halliwell. Col Shaw continues to watch him. Pt Halliwell: ... it was up at the prisoner's throat, Sir, and was growling, and its teeth were bared. Halliwell takes a deep breath before continuing. Col Shaw: Who was holding the animal? After Halliwell's statement there is a silence. Shaw gets up out of his chair and goes to the window, down stage. Looking towards the audience, he appears thoughtful and is still looking out while asking the questions. Halliwell licks his lips before answering. Col Shaw: Mmm. (Thoughtful) Did you see the dog actually bite the prisoner, Halliwell? Shaw is still facing the audience, with his back to Halliwell. Pt Halliwell: (Silence) In the silence, Shaw turns to face Halliwell, before speaking in a low threatening voice, staring intently at Halliwell. Col Shaw: Answer the question, Halliwell?	6
Here's an example of a student's annotated script, from her portfolio. Click on the link below to view the script. Open Alex's script (PDF file 1.2 mb) As you can see, Alex has used a light blue font for her annotations. The character, Becky, uses a language register that marks out her monologue [monologue: An extended speech performed by one person only ] as different from the language of the bullying girls. This is excellent, as it tells the audience that these are her inner feelings about the other girls. The student's annotation shows exactly how to stage the scene, with a coloured font to make it show up. In addition, the scene itself is well structured, showing the build-up to the action and finally leaving the stage clear of everyone except Becky. Now the audience are able to think about what happened, and will realise what her feelings are likely to be.	6

We were trying to show one character being teased and taunted by others. We wanted to show that what was happening was upsetting to the victim. During the sequence we chanted insults, which gradually became louder. The character at the front is the victim, and he shows this by his facial expression (he is looking downwards with a hurt expression) and his body language, which shows tension. The bullies stand behind him so that they can be seen by the audience. They are leaning in towards him as they chant insults. Their faces show cruel laughter and sneering. There could be a small alteration of the sequence, with the actor at the centre of the bullies standing a little taller. This could still have shown the audience that the bullies were more powerful, but the character would have been seen more clearly by all of the audience. A clear sense of the candidate knowing what the scene is supposed to show, and how that has been achieved. The possible improvement given shows that the candidate is aware of how the sequence will be seen by the audience. Overall, clear explanations and a solid sense that the candidate knows how and why the sequence was effective. Check out more body language in the Expressions gallery.	6
By using the What?Â Why? and How? technique, you can find all the detail you need to include in your portfolio [portfolio: A collection of your work, completed over the duration of your studies ]. Here's an example of how to do it, based on the exercise on the previous page. Our teacher asked us to create a still image of the moment when the boy confronted the girl spreading the rumours about him. She wanted us to be able to show the moment when the boy found his own inner strength to do something about the rumours. We decided that we needed to show clearly the impact of his anger on the girl, and that she should suddenly realise that she can't push him around any longer. The actor playing the role of the girl showed in her body language and facial expression that she was shocked that he'd found out it was her who was spreading the rumours. She had to show tension in her body, and made her eyes open wider than usual to show panic. This was to communicate to the audience the impact of the confrontation on her, to show that she was both shocked and a little scared of what was going to happen. When writing about a still image, it's a good idea to use an image, diagram or stick man drawing to show how the still image was performed.	6
With audience on two sides, characters 1 and 2 enter at one end of the traverse, and speak their lines. They smile broadly at each other, and 'freeze'. Character 3 enters at the opposite end, and says his/her line with the attitude of someone intending to shock. Characters 1 and 2 react by turning their heads towards 3, with shock registering on their faces. Spotlights come up on each character as they speak their lines. Characters 1 and 2 should react to 3's declaration, so that there is a brief tableau after 3 speaks. The characters are not on levels. The characters come into the acting area one by one, and just stand facing two sections of the audience. During their entrances, car engine sound effects can be played. When this has stopped, the actors speak the lines. For more about the areas of the stage, read the stage Revision Bite in the Performing section.	6
After each character has said their opening line, what do you want the audience to be thinking? They'll probably presume that the cause of the accident is character 3. A twist could be that one of the other characters caused the accident. It's for you to decide who this might be, and create a character that suits your version of events. In the opening lines there's a hint that something unusual has happened. It's for you to choose who this has happened to, and why. If the drama is to work well, the audience has to feel some empathy [empathy: An awareness and understanding of another person's feelings, situation or motives. ] for the characters, so they care what happens to them. To make this happen, you need to focus the drama on the characters. Hot-seating [hot-seating: To question an individual while they remain in character ] the characters could reveal important information about them, and provide ideas for scenes that help an audience get to know them. When developing scenes for your drama, decide whether you want the characters to have met before the drama starts. For example, could the Ghanaian doctor have treated character 3 for injuries he got when he was fighting drunk? Could character 3 have met character 1 when his gang caused trouble at the club at an earlier time? This is a way of showing that the two characters had met before, little knowing that their paths would cross again. At the same time you can show something of what they're like.	6
Here are some ideas about how you can stage the important, central, accident scene. Character 3 and two friends are driving along (stage this with two characters standing in a spotlight with the third character leaning into the space between their heads and shoulders). They are laughing and shouting. The 'car' stops and the two friends exit leaving 3 alone. The action freezes, and the lights go up on the other side of stage. Character 1 is shouting off-stage, having an argument with her husband. She crosses the stage, grabbing her car keys as she goes. Character 2 is at home, when the sound of a crash outside is heard. He goes to the 'window' and looks out. He mimes picking up a phone, and gives details of the scene he can see outside. He says he's a doctor and will go to help. Blackout. When the lights come on again, the sound of loud music is heard and two bodies are seen, lying awkwardly - one on the ground the other on the chairs as if in a car. Character 2 approaches the bodies and leans into the 'car' to turn off the radio. Silence. Character 2 looks at the two bodies, and bends down to check for signs of life. He starts making the accident victims more comfortable. Character 3 starts moaning, character 2 tells him that the ambulance will soon be here. Freeze. Using physical theatre [physical theatre: A mime technique in which actors use their bodies to create props or part of the set ], the characters 1 and 3 are drivers of cars made up of the other actors. Each 'vehicle' faces the audience, and each is lit by a spotlight, with the rest of the stage in darkness. The actors making up the vehicles can make the sound of the cars, gear-changing etc. Character 1 is angry and driving badly. She talks about her husband and their argument this morning. She makes angry comments about other drivers on the road. She jumps a red light, saying 'No-one will be around this time of the morning'. Character 3 is playing music (perhaps rap style performed by a member of the cast forming his car.) He sees character 1 crossing his path, and shouts, 'I can't stop!' Character 1 shouts, 'Oh no! Another car - I'm gonna hit him!'. Sound effects can be used here to create the skidding noises, engine noises and sound of breaking glass. The lights go out. Silence. General lights come back up to reveal two bodies lying on the 'road'. Voices are heard saying things such as:'She drove straight through the red light!' 'The other driver didn't have a chance!' 'She was going too fast!' 'Are they still alive?' Everything sounds confused and chaotic. Eventually a siren is heard as the lights fade down.	6
Deciding on the ending is important too. Do you want to finish using the same sequence as at the start? This could focus the audience's mind on the characters and how they came together in a fateful manner. Do you want to have character 3 in a wheelchair - facing his life without hope of walking again? Perhaps using a monologue to tell the audience how he feels? Do you want the families of each of the characters trying to come to terms with what has happened? The final scene must have impact, and make clear the whole point that you intend for your drama.	6

Images can be useful in your portfolio for explaining a point or illustrating what you did in your drama.Images can be useful in your portfolio - for explaining to the points you make, or help make your descriptions come to life. This Revision Bite will help you make your images work well in your portfolio. These are not good reasons for using images, and you will not gain marks through doing this. If you use images for the reasons above, you're likely to gain extra marks. However, remember to analyse each image carefully, providing written explanation or annotations. Remember, images don't just refer to photographs - you can use sketches, drawings, stick men diagrams or any type of image, so long as you use it to make a point.	6
This is a still-image of our work when we were exploring the abuse of prisoners in Abu Ghraib prison. We were trying to communicate that the prisoner was being intimidated by two US soldiers, and that this was a harrowing experience for the prisoner. I feel we should have arranged the image better, so that the proxemics could more easily show what was happening. If the prisoner had been placed facing the audience it would have been easier to see his expression, and if the two soldiers had been placed a little upstage on each side of the prisoner, we could have shown the expressions of everyone - and the face of one soldier character would not have been hidden by their hair. The prisoner should have looked more intimidated than is shown in the actor's body language - she looked too relaxed to communicate the terror the prisoner must have felt. The candidate has written well about the image, and has included some evaluative remarks that point out the shortcomings of the group's work. It is clear that the candidate realizes how the work could have been improved, and this demonstrates understanding of the process.	6
During the phase of the work when we were developing scenes to show the abuse in Abu Ghraib prison, we were working to show how the soldiers were intimidated by their own superior officers, because of the abuse that they were investigating. We wanted to show how by making the officer stand behind the soldier, with the soldier too scared to turn around, we were able to show the status of the officer. We could also show the way in which he could signal his feelings to the audience, without the prisoner seeing any facial expressions. This would also leave the soldier able to show his own anxiety in the situation, through his body language and facial expressions. The actor here was able to signal this well. Here the image is commented on by the candidate, and it is clear that the proxemics are such that the candidates were able to heighten the sense of anxiety in the scene, and to show this to the audience. The candidate has explained well the reasons for their staging of this sequence.	6
This image shows our work at a point when we, the staff in the care home, were taking the old lady away from her room to clean her up after she had spilled her food. We wanted to show that the staff can be harsh in their treatment of the elderly residents of the home and that they don't treat some of their residents as they state in their brochures. As it is shown here, the staff members look as if they are not caring, and I think that this would be clear to an audience. I think we were able to show that the old woman looks scared and that the staff look uncaring about her fears. The girl playing the old lady is showing through her facial expression and body language that she is scared and we planned that the audience would be shocked by this treatment of her. The comment by the candidate has first been put into context, so that the situation is more understandable. The evaluation and reflection on his / her work illustrates some strong aspects, and others where the candidate feels that improvements could be made. This indicates that the candidate has a good level of knowledge and understanding.	6

Open Amy's letter (PDF file 730kb) This letter is written in-role ['in-role': When you are acting as your character and behaving and thinking as they would. 'In-role' writing involves you writing about feelings/situations through your character's eyes. ], and also forms the basis of a scene between the character Jayne and her elderly mother. Amy has also included thought-tracks in the letter (in red writing), to show how the character is writing one thing, but actually thinking another. The candidate has written a good letter, which shows concern about her mother. However, the use of the thought-tracks - spoken by another actor - show that she's not as concerned as the doctor is being led to believe. This is a good use of thought-tracking, to inform the audience of the character's private feelings, contrasting with what she is pretending to feel. The use of a split-stage to highlight the mother's struggle makes the whole sequence more poignant.	6
This diary entry is written in-role and is intended to be read as a monologue [monologue: An extended speech performed by one person only ] during a scene (stage directions are shown in brackets). The character is a midwife called Mary, who lives in Salem during the time of the famous witch hunts. Open Alex's diary entry (PDF file 548kb) This student has written a good diary entry, in which she uses a different register from modern English, in keeping with the era of the drama. She introduces the piece with some useful information about her character. Her acting directions - written in a different font - stand out well from the rest of the text, and she focuses clearly on how the actor could deliver the lines. This piece of work shows that the student is clear about the impact she wants her character to have on the audience .	6
For your drama coursework, you'll create two drama exploration portfolios - one for Unit 1 and one for Unit 2. Each will need no more than six sheets of A4 paper. Each portfolio needs to cover three stages: Response, Development and Evaluation. This Revision Bite gives you an introduction to making a portfolio. A portfolio is another name for drama coursework. Together, your two written drama portfolios will count for 60 per cent of your total mark. Your portfolio should be no larger than 6 sheets of A4 sized paper - using both sides of the paper. OR You may use 6 sheets of A3 paper - writing on one side only. OR You can use a mixture of both A4 and A3 paper - where one sheet of A4 paper is replaced with one sheet of A3 paper. A drama exploration workshop usually takes place during drama lessons, and may continue over a number of weeks. This is where you will write the content for your portfolio [portfolio: A collection of your work, completed over the duration of your studies ] when you have developed your ideas.	6
As part of your drama work you need to be aware of the links between the stimuli (drama texts such as artefacts, images, text, video clip etc) your teacher will give you. In your portfolio, you will need to write about the issues and themes these stimuli make you think about. This Revision Bite shows you how to approach making links between stimuli. When you're first given your stimuli [stimuli: things that set off a reaction in the nervous system - for example, light, heat, sound, gravity, smell, taste, or temperature. Don't aim to write paragraphs, just simple one word points will do. Noting down your first reactions to the stimuli can help you develop your work later. When you've made notes on your stimuli, your teacher might suggest doing some research into the themes and topics you've discovered. It's a good idea to do this - it will help you develop your drama well, when you need to.	6
Imagine you've been given these two images as stimuli for a unit called : 'Food Glorious Food'. Make brief notes about each image in the white space provided. Press the 'Enter' button for some suggested answers. Now you've made short notes about the images, you should be able to recognise the issues and themes that they both deal with. When you make links between the stimuli, try to be as precise as possible. In this example, saying that the link is 'not eating enough' is correct, but you can say more. Here it would be better to use the words 'famine' for the malnourished boy and 'eating disorder' for the model. These are the terms you can research, and find out more information about.	6
Another way to make links is to write a few paragraphs, perhaps using a table as a guide to your writing. Read the paragraphs below - they've been made up by using ideas from the table on the previous page. In our work on 'Food, Glorious Food' we looked at how we in the developed world have lots of food to eat and yet we have a problem in our society with young girls and some boys starving themselves in order to become thin. Nowadays it is fashionable to be thin and most of the stars of film and television are super-slim. Young girls see models and pop stars who are generally very thin and want to be like them. Although in our society there are now more obese people than ever before, because of our obsession with weight there are also more people who regularly diet to try and control their weight. An eating disorder sufferer can die if nursing staff are unable to get her to eat. In another part of the world people are dying because of a lack of food. Sometimes this is because of drought, sometimes war and sometimes because their governments don't make sure that their people are well fed. We in the developed countries send aid to drought-stricken countries to help - although there are times when the aid doesn't get to the people it is meant for. Sometimes in these countries the people in power eat well and have all the advantages that we in developed countries have, while their people are living below the poverty line. In these countries to be thin isn't fashionable - they don't have the luxury of fashion as they are too preoccupied with staying alive. The images of the two different people are so similar and yet their reasons for looking like this are worlds apart. How ironic that with all our advantages we abuse and waste our food - having food mountains that we can't sell and in poorer countries they haven't enough food to eat at all. How sad that we choose to waste or not eat our food, sometimes even to the point of death and there are those who die because they haven't got the basic foods they need.	6

Make sure the table demonstrates a thoughtful consideration of the links - even if your drama work didn't touch on all of these. The table below could be used for the example on the previous page.

In the evaluation phase of Unit 2 (Drama Exploration II), you need to talk about a live theatrical performance. This Revision Bite tells you what to watch out for in the productions you go to see, so you can describe them in your portfolio. For the evaluation phase in Unit 2 of your portfolio, you need to produce material for 4 sides of A4 paper, or 2 sides of A3 paper. So it's important when you go to the live performance to take a notebook and make plenty of notes about the production. You can include sketches and diagrams too, so do get as much detail as possible during the performance. This table will help you with ideas for evaluating a performance.	6
When you're developing characters, you need as much information as possible about them. This can help you get into your role. In this Revision Bite, you'll learn how to tease out this information, using a 'role on the wall' diagram. A 'role on the wall' diagram is usually just an outline of a person with information written on it - either inside the outline, or round the edge. It represents the character you're exploring. Your 'role on the wall' diagram could be part of your portfolio [portfolio: A collection of your work, completed over the duration of your studies ]. Often the work you do on it leads to good ideas for scenes, so be sure to point this out in your portfolio written work. Tip: if you're having trouble imagining your character, try hot-seating [hot-seating: To question an individual while they remain in character ] - you'll soon get the ideas flowing!	6
Some good information here. Further details could include: - Why does character look up to Shaz? - When has character shown that she likes having power? - Why is character scared of Shaz? What has happened in the past? Further details like this could make a difference to your grade, by showing your understanding of why the character is like she is. Tip: Ask the questions 'Why? ', 'What?' or 'When?' as you develop your work. Your answers might surprise you, and give you the details you need!	6
This student has shown her information in a different format - which is fine. There are some interesting points here, and they're well balanced. But the table could be more detailed, giving a greater insight into the character, eg: - In what way is character shown to be caring? - In what ways does character feel helpless? - What would character like to be able to do? - Why do others see character as a cheat? Tip: Remember to ask yourself 'Why? ', 'What?' or 'When?' about some of your statements, to give greater information on the characters.	6
Megan is part of a group who bully a younger girl. Megan is ashamed of herself after bullying the student, and for taking her money. Think about how you would interpret and stage this scene. How would you do this using three actors? Would you focus on the victim or the bully? What theme would you focus on - guilt, peer pressure, regrets? Would you use flash-forwards or flash-backs?	6
Shakespeare's 'Macbeth' was written hundreds of years ago - so how can we relate to it today? The answer is to consider the social issues the play deals with. In other words, a modern audience can appreciate the issues involved in plays written in the past. Sometimes a director will choose to set Macbeth in modern times - to show how relevant the ideas in it are to us today. This often works well, but it can be hard to show the witches in a convincing way - it depends on the culture of the audience. In, say, Haiti - a culture where some people believe strongly in magic - the witch scenes would be much easier to do than in Britain. In other words, the general culture of the audience it is aimed at is an important factor when you are thinking about a play. Most audiences these days don't believe in witches as they did in Shakespeare's time. This means a modern director has to approach the problem of the witches in a way that is acceptable now. When Shakespeare was alive, people thought witches were powerful, and audiences found the play frightening, so it's important in modern productions that the witches still seem menacing - not comic or weak. In other words, modern audiences may have ideas about an old play that are completely different from those of people in historical times. If you are working with a text or stimuli from the past - try doing a bit of research to find out what people of that time were thinking about (in diaries, letters, newspaper articles).	6
Chinua Achebe was born in Nigeria in 1930 where his father worked for the Church Missionary Society. After university, he studied broadcasting at the BBC then worked in Lagos for the Nigerian Broadcasting Service. Chinua Achebe is one of the most admired African novelists who write in English. His novels trace Africa's transition from traditional to modern ways. He writes with a mission, and he believes that any good work of art should have a purpose - an idea that stems from the oral tradition of storytelling in Africa. He is interested in speech and his novels present a wide range of language, from the English spoken by the Ibo to different levels of formalformal: 'Official' or 'standard' English, as opposed to spoken, colloquial or dialect English; stiffly polite. Can also mean 'to do with form'. English. He also writes poetry and essays. He married in 1961 and has four children. He became an honorary professor at the University of Nigeria in 1985.	6
Picture courtesy of Brian R. Logan perching high on broken bone of a dead tree nestled close to his mate his smooth bashed-in head, a pebble on a stem rooted in a dump of gross feathers, inclined affectionately to hers. Yesterday they picked the eyes of a swollen corpse in a water-logged trench and ate the things in its bowel. Full gorged they chose their roost keeping the hollowed remnant in easy range of cold telescopic eyes ... Strange indeed how love in other ways so particular will pick a corner in that charnel-house tidy it and coil up there, perhaps even fall asleep - her face turned to the wall! ...Thus the Commandant at Belsen Camp going home for the day with fumes of human roast clinging rebelliously to his hairy nostrils will stop at the wayside sweet-shop and pick up a chocolate for his tender offspring waiting at home for Daddy's return ... Praise bounteous providence if you will that grants even an ogre a tiny glow-worm tenderness encapsulated in icy caverns of a cruel heart or else despair for in every germ of that kindred love is lodged the perpetuity of evil. The poem begins with a graphic and unpleasant description of a pair of vultures who nestle lovingly together after feasting on a corpse. The poet remarks on the strangeness of love, existing in places one would not have thought possible. He goes on to consider the 'love' a concentration camp commander shows to his family - having spent his day burning human corpses, he buys them sweets on the way home. The conclusion of the poem is ambiguousambiguous: Open to more than one interpretation.. On one hand, Achebe praises providence that even the cruelest of beings can show sparks of love, yet on the other, he despairs - they show love solely for their family, and so allow themselves to commit atrocities towards others.	6
The poem is written in free versefree verse: Poetry that has little or no rhyme scheme, regular pattern of rhythms, or line lengths., with lines of different lengths. The lines are short, so we read the poem slowly and can appreciate its full horrors. It is divided into four sections. Each is marked by an indented line rather than a new stanzastanza: A group of lines of poetry that make up a unit - like a paragraph in a piece of prose; a verse., perhaps to emphasise the logical flow of ideas. There is minimal punctuation - why? Think about how the language the poet uses helps to convey his ideas.	6
The opening lines of the poem are dark. The 'greyness' (line 1) is heightened by the heavy alliteration 'in drizzle of one despondent dawn' (line 2) and even the approaching 'sunbreak' (line 4) does not lift the atmosphere. There are metaphors of horror and death: the 'dead tree' (line 6) branch on which the vultures are roosting is described as a 'broken bone' (line 5), while the male vulture's bashed-in head is a 'pebble on a stem' (line 9) and its body is a 'dump of gross feathers' (line 11). In the second section, the vultures' affection leads the poet on to muse about the nature of love. Love is personified as a woman finding a place to sleep. She is 'in other ways so particular' (line 23) and hard to please, yet, strangely, she chooses to sleep with the vultures, 'that charnel house' (line 26). Yet why does love sleep with 'her face turned to the wall' (line 28)? We see the 'Belsen Commandant' - a mass murderer - as Daddy. Why does Achebe use a child's name for him rather than 'father'? In the fourth section, the poet again uses metaphors: the evil Commandant is 'an ogre' (line 43) with merely a spark of love - 'a tiny glow-worm tenderness' (line 44) in the 'icy caverns of a cruel heart' (line 46). These are fairly clichÃ©d images, perhaps because Achebe wanted to suggest that what he is describing is nothing new: there will always be love and evil in the world. The 'germ' (line 48) of love does not seem to grow as a normal seed would because the 'perpetuity of evil' (line 50) is bound up with it and prevents it from developing. (Think of wheat germ rather than disease-carrying germs.)	6

In the 1960s, as part of its policy of apartheid [apartheid: system of racial segregation and repression of non-white people in pre-democratic South Africa. Apartheid means 'separate development'. ] the government declared District 6 a 'whites-only' area, and began to evacuate the population. Over a period of years, the entire area was razed to the ground. Most of it has never been built on. The poem was written just after the official end of apartheid [apartheid: system of racial segregation and repression of non-white people in pre-democratic South Africa. Apartheid means 'separate development'. ]. It was a time of hope - Nelson Mandela had recently been released from prison, and the ANC was about to form the government of South Africa. Tatamkhulu Afrika's life story is complicated, but knowing something about it will help you to understand the feelings expressed in this poem. Tatamkhulu Afrika was brought up in Cape Town, South Africa, as a white South African. When he was a teenager, he found out that he was actually Egyptian-born - the child of an Arab father and a Turkish mother. The South African government began to classify every citizen by colour - white, black and coloured. Afrika turned down the chance to be classed as white, and chose instead to become a Muslim and be classified as coloured. In 1984, the poet joined the ANC (the African National Congress - the organisation leading the struggle against apartheid). Arrested in 1987 for terrorism, he was banned from writing or speaking in public for five years. At this point, he adopted the name - Tatamkhulu Afrika - which had previously been his ANC code name. This enabled him to carry on writing, despite the ban. Of his own sense of identity, the poet said: ""I am completely African. I am a citizen of Africa; I'm a son of Africa - that is my culture. I know I write poems that sound European, because I was brought up in school to do that, but, if you look at my poems carefully, you will find that all of them, I think, have an African flavour."""	6
Small round hard stones click under my heels, seeding grasses thrust bearded seeds into trouser cuffs, cans, trodden on, crunch in tall, purple-flowering, amiable weeds. District Six. No board says it is: but my feet know, and my hands, and the skin about my bones, and the soft labouring of my lungs, and the hot, white, inwards turning anger of my eyes. Brash with glass, name flaring like a flag, it squats in the grass and weeds, incipient Port Jackson trees: new, up-market, haute cuisine, guard at the gatepost, whites only inn. No sign says it is: but we know where we belong. I press my nose to the clear panes, know, before I see them, there will be crushed ice white glass, linen falls, the single rose. Down the road, working man's cafe sells bunny chows. Take it with you, eat it at a plastic table's top, wipe your fingers on your jeans, spit a little on the floor: it's in the bone. I back from the glass, boy again, leaving small mean O of small mean mouth. Hands burn for a stone, a bomb, to shiver down the glass. Nothing's changed. The poet returns to the wasteland that was once his home, and relives the anger he felt when the area was first destroyed. He sees a new restaurant: expensive, stylish, exclusive, with a guard at the gatepost. He thinks about the poverty around it, especially the working man's cafÃ© nearby, where people eat without plates from a plastic tabletop. This makes him reflect that despite the changing political situation, there are still huge inequalities between blacks and whites. Even though South Africa is supposed to have changed, he knows the new restaurant is really 'whites-only'. He feels that nothing has really changed. The deep anger he feels makes him want to destroy the restaurant - to smash the glass with a stone, or a bomb.	6
We can imagine how his hands 'burn' to take revenge. It is a physical image - one we can almost feel ourselves. The imagesimages: Visual representations of something; mental pictures; personas that are presented to the world. in the poem - of the wasteland itself, the expensive restaurant, and the working man's cafe - are sharply contrasted. Which two images seem to you to highlight most strongly the inequalities that the poet observes? You'll find two very short sentences in this poem - look at line 9 and line 48. What effect do these short, sharp sentences produce?	6
The skin cracks like a pod.There never is enough water. Imagine the drip of it,the small splash, echoin a tin mug,the voice of a kindly god. Sometimes, the sudden rushof fortune. The municipal pipe bursts,silver crashes to the groundand the flow has founda roar of tongues. From the huts,a congregation: every man womanchild for streets aroundbutts in, with pots,brass, copper, aluminium,plastic buckets,frantic hands, and naked childrenscreaming in the liquid sun,their highlights polished to perfection,flashing light,as the blessing singsover their small bones.	6
The poem is structured into four stanzasstanzas: Lines of poetry that make up a unit; verses. of different lengths. It is significant that short stanzas (with short, abrupt sentences) express what it is like to be without water, and longer stanzas (with flowing sentences) show what it is like suddenly to have water. The essence of water. Picture courtesy of Akshay Mahajan Can you find any words in this poem that rhyme [rhyme: In poetry, the use of words which have the same or a similar sound - eg 'flow' and 'bow' - to form a pattern of sound. ]? For example, note pod/god and ground/found/around. What is the effect of these words? Can you find any alliteration [alliteration: Words strung together with repeated (often initial) consonants, eg Max made many men mad. ]? Try 'the flow has found' (line 10), 'polished to perfection' (line 20). What is the effect of this?	6
The poem opens with a striking imageimage: A visual representation of something; a mental picture; a persona that is presented to the world. of dryness: 'The skin cracks like a pod'. How does a pod crack? What sort of skin/pod do you imagine here? What effect does this simile have on you? The sound of a drip of water is described in a metaphor [metaphor: A description of one thing in terms of another - implicitly comparing the two, but without using 'as' or 'like'. 'Sea of troubles', and 'drowning in debt' are metaphors. Something that represents another thing. ] as 'the voice of a kindly god', while water itself is referred to as fortune, as silver, and as 'the blessing'. What do these words have in common? 'Blessing' is a religious word: blessings come from gods. A congregation can just mean 'a crowd of people', but its main meaning is 'a crowd of worshippers'. What does this imagery [imagery: Vivid 'word pictures' used by a writer to conjure up a mental image of something. ] suggest about the importance of water? Why did the poet choose 'Blessing' as the title of her poem? Imtiaz Dharker has said this about the rhythm [rhythm: The pattern of stressed and unstressed syllables in a line of poetry. ] My first instinct when I'm writing and when I'm saying the poems aloud is always to get into a kind of iambic rhythm, so what I begin to do then is to break the rhythm - break it internally. So I take it very much from spoken rhythms, but, at the same time, I'm trying to do some bouncing off. I'm really talking about the rhythms of my spoken word, which might be different from the rhythms of someone else's. By iambic the poet means a steady, regular rhythm that alternates stressed and unstressed syllables in a fixed pattern. She prefers irregular patterns in her writing.	6
Much of the meaning of a poem is conveyed by the attitude it expresses towards its subject matter. Attitude can be thought of as a combination of the poet's tone of voice and the ideas he or she is trying to get across to the reader. How should the poem be read? Choose a short quotation to justify your choice. The main idea in this poem is that water - so essential to life - comes to be seen by people in a hot, dry country as supremely precious, a divine gift - a blessing.

Here is the introduction and first section of a sample answer written by a student. It deals with the descriptions of the scorpion and the vultures.Hold your mouse over the numbers throughout the essay to see the examiner's comments. (1 [1: CHANGED This first paragraph introduces an idea, makes reference to the essay title, and shows appreciation of the poetâ€™s craft. ]) In â€˜Night of the Scorpionâ€™ and â€˜Vulturesâ€™ the use of description is both vivid and surprising. The descriptions often lead the reader to expect a certain conclusion or tone and then the poetsâ€™ use of description changes and this changes the readerâ€™s anticipation of how the poems might develop; this is what makes the poems thought-provoking and surprising. (2 [2: A device, the name of the poem is deliberately chosen to make the reader think about horror. ]) The title â€˜Night of the Scorpionâ€™ sounds like the sort of name a horror film might be given. This is misleading because this poem is not like a horror film at all. (3 [3: Recognising an attitude of the poet. ]) Instead of the scorpion being the enemy, the poet's description of the scorpionâ€™s circumstances leads us to feel sympathy for it. (4 [4: Quotes back up points. ]) He has been â€˜drivenâ€™ into the hut by â€˜ten hours of steady rainâ€™. (5 [5: Analysis of language. ]) The use of the word â€˜drivenâ€™ suggests that this is a last resort for the scorpion. He really does not want to be there, but heâ€™s desperate to be dry and quiet, so he crawls â€˜beneath a sack of riceâ€™. At this point, we do not see the scorpion as an object of fear or horror as the title of the poems suggests. Ezekielâ€™s sympathy for the scorpion is contrasted with the moment that the scorpion stings his mother - â€˜flashâ€™ reflects the sudden and shocking moment of the sting. (6 [6: Quotes with analysis. ]) His tail is described as â€˜diabolicâ€™ and the neighbours call the scorpion â€˜the evil oneâ€™; (7 [7: Analysis of language and identification of a technique. ]) the repetition of â€˜Pâ€™ in the alliteration â€˜parting with his poisonâ€™ helps the reader feel the sudden and dangerous nature of the sting as the P sounds quick and harsh. (8 [8: Essay moves on to make points about the other poem on a similar point. ]) Similarly, the title of the poem â€˜Vulturesâ€™ leads the reader to make assumptions about what the poem is about. In fact, the poem is not really about vultures at all, the vultures are a (9 [9: Identification of a literary device. ]) symbol for an (10 [10: Identification of the idea explored by the poem. ]) idea that the poet wants to explore: the idea that love can be found in unexpected places. (11 [11: Appreciation of the imagery and identification of a literary technique. ]) The description of the vultures is harsh and the imagery is of death and violence. The opening (12 [12: Identification of literary technique. ]) alliteration helps set a (13 [13: Appreciation of the tone. ]) tone that sounds negative - the dawn is described as â€˜despondentâ€™ and drizzly. (14 [14: Quotes with analysis of the effects of the words. ]) The hard sound of the D rings through these opening lines, the vultures sit on a â€˜broken bone of a dead treeâ€™. Sunrise is â€˜sunbreakâ€™ and itâ€™s grey, there is no anticipation that this will be a happy or sunny poem and yet, unexpectedly, the vulture inclines his â€˜bashed in headâ€™ to nestle affectionately against his mate. (15 [15: Appreciation of the idea of the poet and his techniques. ]) This one description of love is immediately followed by more images of the repulsive and macabre as the eating habits of the birds are described vividly and stomach turningly. (16 [16: Paragraph that pulls together the poems showing how they are alike in the use of effective description. ]) Both poems use unexpected changes of mood to engage the reader with the ideas of the poems. We start off feeling sympathy for the scorpion, but we are left thinking perhaps this really is a diabolical creature. With the vultures, we feel that they represent something depressing and violent and yet we are surprised by the affection between the two birds.	6
Now think about the next section of both poems - these are the description of the neighbours in 'Night of the Scorpion' and the charnel house in 'Vultures'. Here's a plan of how this section could be written. The following essay section covers this plan, but we have muddled up the order. Try to sort them out so that they flow more logically. The descriptions of places and people in these sections of the poems are highly descriptive and thought-provoking. In the mud hut, the help offered by the neighbours is unwanted and the poet feels it is pointless and intrusive. The atmosphere is busy and irritating. In the charnel house description, there is an atmosphere of calm and ordinariness. Both these descriptions are surprising in the â€˜Night of the Scorpionâ€™ you might think that the help would be welcomed; in the charnel house you are surprised that love is so calm and serene in such abnormal circumstances. The mud hut is alive with activity and pressure to do something. In contrast, the charnel house of the second stanza in â€˜Vulturesâ€™ is surprisingly calm. Again a surprising image because even the word charnel conjures up images of death and in the context of this poem, violence. Even more surprising is the personification of love in the charnel house tidying up. This stanza begins with one word, â€˜strangeâ€™ set alone on a line it causes the reader to pause and evaluate. It is strange, not that love exists in a charnel house - death does not mean that we stop loving people - but that her behaviour is so ordinary: she tidies up, chooses a corner and goes to sleep, â€˜her face turned to the wall!â€™. Why? There are implications here that after death we tidy up our memories of people, perhaps make them â€˜cleanerâ€™, but in the end, the idea of death is a hard thing to face and we try to avoid it, turn away from it. So, ultimately, perhaps this idea is not â€˜strangeâ€™ at all. This repetition of â€˜moreâ€™ also helps the audience to feel that the neighbours are relentless and irritating as they try to help and pray for the bitten mother. The lack of sympathy from the poet can be heard in the repetition of â€˜they saidâ€™. He has disassociated himself from their behaviour, which seems to him to be superstitious and unhelpful. In their prayers, they imply that the mother has sinned in a previous life. The poet seems unhappy about this implication; to use â€˜they saidâ€™ so many times is to register the fact that he does not agree with them. Most of the lines in this section begin with â€˜mayâ€™, which makes what the neighbours say sound like a prayer or incantation and the poet finds these incantations and superstitions silly and pointless. His descriptions make the mud hut sound claustrophobic; it is full of lanterns and candles and shadows and clicking tongues and it continues to rain. The repetition of â€˜andâ€™ helps to build this feeling of pressure and tension. We can see why the scorpion would want to escape the hut and we feel that the poet would like to as well. Both poets use descriptions of places and the activities carried out in them to develop the ideas explored in the poems. In 'Night of the Scorpion', the description of the activity of the neighbours leads us to feel irritated by them, even though they have arrived to help the mother; they are described in a way that makes them seem annoying, like flies: 'The peasants came like a swarm of flies' This simile is continued, they 'buzz' and fuss and 'click'. This irritation is surprising because the neighbours are trying to help. They bring equipment with them: 'More candles, more lanterns, more neighbours,' The correct order of paragraphs is 4, 3, 2, 1.	6
Compare your paragraphs to the ones we have here. Have you remembered to write about attitude/tone, ideas, techniques and description? Remember, your work does not have to be exactly the same in vocabulary or order as it is the content that matters here! Another point of similarity between these poems is that they both describe fathers. At first glance, the Commandant in 'Vultures' has nothing in common with the father in 'Night of the Scorpion', but closer inspection reveals more. The father in 'Night of the Scorpion' is described as 'sceptic, rationalist'. The simple sparse use of these two words reflects his nature. He is logical and thoughtful, probably a man of few words and the poet seems to admire these qualities in his father. But when faced with the possible death of his wife, he becomes illogical and desperate. The following list of all the things he tries to do to help his wife is a sharp comparison with the usual 'rationalist' approach to his life. We suspect that the poet is not impressed at this point. The reason for his sudden change of character is because he loves his wife. He wants to help, but does not know how. He is helpless and children do not like to see that in their parents. We sympathise with the poet's disappointment with his father. The Commandant similarly loves his children, although described as an ogre; a man who 'roasts' other human beings, he is also referred to as 'Daddy'. This childish word reminds us of his home life as a father who wants to buy a treat for his children on his way home from work and we understand how his children feel about their father. We can see from the rest of the description that the poet has no respect for this man. In fact, his description leads the reader to hate him. He buys treats for his 'tender offspring', while he can still smell the equally tender people he has committed to death that day. The two fathers from these poems are alike in some ways. The descriptions of them show that they are loved and admired, but also that they are capable of things that are not admired. Again, the descriptions in the poems develop sudden and contrasting elements to their personalities.	6

May he sit still, they said.May the sins of your previous birthbe burned away tonight, they said.May your suffering decreasethe misfortunes of your next birth, they said.May the sum of all evilbalanced in this unreal world against the sum of goodbecome diminished by your pain.May the poison purify your flesh of desire, and your spirit of ambition,they said, and they sat aroundon the floor with my mother in the centre,the peace of understanding on each face.More candles, more lanterns, more neighbours,more insects, and the endless rain.My mother twisted through and through,groaning on a mat.My father, sceptic, rationalist,trying every curse and blessing,powder, mixture, herb and hybrid.He even poured a little paraffinupon the bitten toe and put a match to it.I watched the flame feeding on my mother.I watched the holy man perform his ritesto tame the poison with an incantation.After twenty hoursit lost its sting. My mother only saidThank God the scorpion picked on meAnd spared my children. The poem is about the night when a woman (the poet's mother) in a poor village in India is stung by a scorpion. Concerned neighbours pour into her hut to offer advice and help. All sorts of cures are tried by the neighbours, her husband and the local holy man, but time proves to be the best healer - 'After twenty hours / it lost its sting. '. After her ordeal, the mother is merely thankful that the scorpion stung her and not the children.	6

Sometimes, this poem will be printed as if it were prose. What differences does it make when it is set out in lines? What, if anything, do the lines and the breaks between them contribute? Think about how the language the poet uses helps to convey his ideas.	6
Much of the meaning of a poem is conveyed by the attitude it expresses towards its subject matter.

The poem's structure is fairly free. The poet doesn't use punctuation; instead, he begins a new line when he wants us to pause in our reading.

The garbagemen are riding 'a bright yellow garbage truck' (line 3) and wear 'red plastic blazers' (line 4); later on we find one of them has 'grey iron hair' (line 19). These are strong colours. The couple in the Mercedes, though, are almost colourless: he wears a 'linen suit' (line 11) - natural linen is a cream colour - and they both have blond hair. Is the poet suggesting that the garbagemen have more colour in their lives? Are the young couple actually colourless and boring? The older garbageman has a hunched back and looks 'like some gargoyle Quasimodo' (line 22). This simile is striking: Quasimodo is the Hunchback of Notre Dame in Victor Hugo's novel. He is a tragic figure: kind and loving despite his ugliness, he finally dies of a broken heart. Quasimodo means almost finished or half made. Do you think Ferlinghetti compares the dustman to Quasimodo simply to help us imagine his appearance, or for other reasons? The garbagemen stare at the young couple 'as from a great distance' (line 27). They are actually close together, stuck at the red light. Does the image suggest the 'distance' between the lives each pair lead? For the dustmen, looking at the couple is the same as 'watching some odourless TV ad' (line 29) - the ways of life portrayed seem impossibly perfect. To the garbagemen, the couple are almost unreal and their lifestyle is out of reach. The closing lines of the poem involve a metaphor about the sea. If America is the high seas, the distance between the two vehicles is a 'small gulf' (line 35) or narrow mouth that should be easy to cross. Yet we also think of the other meaning of gulf - a deep chasm or abyss. It may look possible to cross, but really it is impossible. The lives of the two pairs may cross 'for an instant' (line 31), but they will never be genuinely close together. Ferlinghetti uses repetition in his poem. Individual words are repeated, for instance, 'elegant' (lines 8 and 9) and 'scavengers' (lines 16 and 26), as well as phrases such as 'as if' (29 and 33). What is the effect of this?	6
Lawrence Ferlinghetti was born in 1919 in New York, but he is mostly associated with San Francisco as one of the main poets of the Beat movementBeat movement: A 1950s American counter-culture style founded by writers Jack Kerouac, Allen Ginsburg and William Burroughs.. In 1953, he co-founded a publishing house and bookshop called City Lights, which specialised in Beat poetry and became a meeting place for poets and artists. His first book was published in 1955; he has since written 17 more books of poetry, drama, prose and translation. He often writes about politics and social issues, as seen in Two Scavengers... He was named as San Francisco's first Poet Laureate in 1998.

In the exam, you will be required to write about two or more poems. Which poems could you compare 'Two Scavengers in a Truck...' to? There will be a number of ways in which the poems can be compared, and you may well be able to think of other similarities!	6
John Agard came to England from Guyana in 1977. Like many people from the Caribbean, he is mixed race - his mother is Portuguese, but born in Guyana and his father is black. One of the things he enjoys about living in England is the wide range of people he meets: 'The diversity of cultures here is very exciting'. However, one of the things he doesn't like is the view of racial origins, which is implied in the word 'half-caste', still used by many people to describe people of mixed race. The term now is considered rude and insulting. Find out more about the word 'caste' at the end of this section.	6
The poem is written in five stanzas of varying lengths. Look carefully at the gaps between the stanzas (lines 38/39, 47/48 and 50/51). Why do you think the poet left these gaps, when the sentence seems to run on into the next stanza? The lines throughout the poem are quite short, perhaps to hammer home the message. When you read the poem, you will notice that certain phrases (eg 'Explain yuself, half') are repeated or echoed, which builds up a pattern in the language. Do you think that this repetition is a successful way of strengthening the impact of his argumentargument: A text's central thought or sequence of ideas. (Not to be confused with an argy-bargy! )? The poem relies on comparisons to make us see how stupid it is to judge things that are in contrasting colours as only 'half' worthy. He uses examples of great and famous artists (Picasso and Tchaikovsky). What is the effect of this? He also uses the weather as an example of something that is full of contrasting colour. Think about what the poet is doing when he uses the phrase 'overcast' (line 20). It sounds like the same word as 'caste' with an 'e', but is actually an entirely different word. Do you think this adds to the humour of the poem? Agard said: 'I think humour can be very powerful. Humour breaks down boundaries, it topples our self-importance, it connects people, and because it engages and entertains, it ultimately enlightens.' The poet has decided not to use standard English in this poem.	6
"Try reading the poem aloud. What sort of tone should it be read in? Finally, what idea is the poet seeking to get across in this poem? Why did he write it? ""This imposition of half, half, half on a person's total human complexity implies that some sort of 'purity' has been subverted. A child of mixed race is a tangible, loving expression of human beings from different cultural backgrounds getting together - that should be seen not as something threatening, but as something enriching..."""	6
They sent me a salwar kameezpeacock-blue,and anotherglistening like an orange split open,embossed slippers, gold and blackpoints curling.Candy-striped glass banglessnapped, drew blood.Like at school, fashions changedin Pakistan -the salwar bottoms were broad and stiff,then narrow.My aunts chose an apple-green sari,silver-borderedfor my teens. I tried each satin-silkentop -was alien in the sitting-room.I could never be as lovelyas those clothes -I longedfor denim and corduroy.My costume clung to meand I was aflame,I couldn't rise up out of its fire,half-English,unlike Aunt Jamila. I wanted my parents'camel-skin lamp -switching it on in my bedroom,to consider the crueltyand the transformationfrom camel to shade,marvel at the colourslike stained glass. My mother cherished herjewellery -Indian gold, dangling, filigree,But it was stolen from our car.The presents were radiant in my wardrobe.My aunts requested cardigansfrom Marks and Spencers. My salwar kameezdidn't impress the schoolfriendwho sat on my bed, asked to seemy weekend clothes.But often I admired the mirror-work,tried to glimpse myselfin the miniatureglass circles, recall the storyhow the three of ussailed to England.Prickly heat had me screaming on the way.I ended up in a cotIn my English grandmother's dining-room,found myself alone,playing with a tin-boat. I pictured mybirthplacefrom fifties' photographs.When I was olderthere was conflict, a fractured landthrobbing through newsprint.Sometimes I saw Lahore -my aunts in shaded rooms,screened from male visitors,sorting presents,wrapping them in tissue. Or there were beggars,sweeper-girlsand I was there -of no fixed nationality,staring through fretworkat the Shalimar Gardens.	6
The poem is a sequence of personal memories. I is repeated a lot in the poem. When we are remembering things, our minds often drift from one imageimage: A visual representation of something; a mental picture; a persona that is presented to the world. to another, in the way that the poem does, and sometimes surprise us by fixing on odd details - like the 'tin boat', perhaps (line 54). The poem is full of associated, sometimes contrasting, images. Here are two lists of words that describe things to do with Pakistani culture and things associated with English culture. Picture courtesy of Jason R. Kessenich Add to the lists and think about the words that the poet has chosen. The final imageimage: A visual representation of something; a mental picture; a persona that is presented to the world. in a poem tends to carry a particular significance - it's the one our imagination is left with.	6
Read the poem carefully and see where Sujata Bhatt plays with these meanings. For example, she imagines that knowing two languages is like having 'two tongues in your mouth' (line 4). The poet compares her tongue to a plant, as she develops her ideas. This is called an extended metaphorextended metaphor: A metaphor is a descripton of one thing in terms of another - implicitly comparing the two, but without using 'as' or 'like' - eg 'he was drowning in a sea of troubles'. An extended metaphor keeps going, and likens several different aspects of the two things - eg 'he was drowning in a sea of troubles, buffeted by a storm of misfortune, overwhelmed by waves of despair'.. The lists below describe some of the ways in which her mother tongue is compared to a plant. Why do you think this imageimage: A visual representation of something; a mental picture; a persona that is presented to the world. is so successful? Why do you think that the poem begins in a colloquialcolloquial: Informal spoken language; slang way (using everyday language), but uses such striking imagery towards the end? Try reading it aloud. The Gujarati script is transliteratedtransliterated: To transliterate means to represent words in one alphabet using corresponding letters from another alphabet. into a phoneticphonetic: Using letters to represent the sounds of speech. English version in brackets, so even if you don't know any Gujarati, you can still have a go. If the poem says more or less the same thing twice, might it just as well be written in one language only? What do you think would be lost if the Gujarati disappeared?	6
"Tom Leonard was born in Glasgow, and still lives there. He has described his childhood upbringing as ""working class West of Scotland Irish Catholic"" (his father was from Dublin). Although his passport identifies him as a British citizen, Tom Leonard sees himself as thoroughly Scottish. Some of his poetry is written in his own Glaswegian dialectdialect: The language of a particular subset of English speakers - often those living in a particular place - having its own unique diction, vocabulary, spelling and even grammar.. His aim has always been to make poetry using 'my own ordinary working-class West of Scotland speech, that is still poetry'. He says he is interested in 'the political nature of voice in British culture'. 'Unrelated Incidents' is a set of six poems, each of which looks at some aspect of the way we use language. It was written in 1976."	6

How would you read this poem? Perhaps it is both. Is the poet arguing that this is actually the way the mediamedia: a collective name for images, video and audio think about us? He believes that the media sees the viewers in Glasgow, or indeed the viewers in most other parts of Britain, as 'scruffs'. Do you think this is fair? The humour has a satiricalsatirical: To do with 'satire' - a type of comic writing in which human folly is wittily derided or attacked. edge: it uses humour to make serious criticisms. Finally, do you think things have changed since 1976, when the poem was written? Are BBC newsreaders still chosen for their 'BBC accents'? What does a Scottish accent - in a TV commercial for example - 'say' about itself these days?	6
What? Where? When? What are the stories of the poems? Answering these questions is a good starting point to help you make sense of the poems, and it can usually be done fairly easily. You should try to understand the formsform: A style of poem, with a particular pattern of rhythm, rhyme pattern or regular line length (eg sonnet, couplets or ballad). of the poems (the way they are constructed). Look at the number and the length of the lines and stanzasstanzas: Lines of poetry that make up a unit; verses. - are they regular? Irregular? Do the lines have a similar length, or do they look random? Are there any very short, direct, lines?	6
When you've got to know the poem, you can begin to see what ideas and attitudes are in it. What else is happening in the poem? What are the feelings of the poet and/or the speaker(s)? You have to make up your mind what the poet's intentions are in writing the poem and what they wanted to say. Make the idea of tone simpler by thinking about it like this: if you were reading the poem aloud, how would you do it? What kind of voice would you use? How would you want an audience to react when they hear it? Practise thinking about tone by reading a number of different poems. How do the poets want the audience to react to each one?	6

The two non-fiction texts are written from very different angles, although they are on similar subjects, and this is reflected in the way they are presented. The text from the BBC is taken from a web page and includes many of the tools that make web pages interactive. The pages are light brown with words written in a darker brown. These colours are appropriate for a subject about the health of the Earth. This is also reflected in the recurring picture of the world that represents the global nature of the subject. The recurring picture is accompanied by an introduction to the subject that appears at the top of every page. This is to help the reader identify where they are in the text and because these pages have two distinct pieces of content - the text and the responses to the questions posed to leading environmentalists - it would be quite easy to forget that this is all one text. The colour, lettering, recurring picture and introduction help to make the two sections more cohesive. The text from the Environment Agency also uses colours that are appropriate for this subject. In this case, blues and greens have been chosen rather than browns. The effect is a cleaner looking page. This is very appropriate because this vision statement mentions cleaner environments rather a lot. This clean look is also achieved by the size and layout - it is large and has very clear white margins. The information is set out using many headings and emphasised words to clearly let the reader know what they are going to read about. The photograph is very large and clearly labelled, although it suggests to the reader a more general idea about building a better future, which is the main premise of this vision statement. Although the two texts look very different, similar devices have been used such as the photographs and colours that all reflect aspects of the environment. There are very few similarities in these texts when one looks at the language used. The vision statement is a very formal piece of writing and seems dramatic or overblown in places, like a political speech, but without the rhetorical devices. For example, the use of words such as â€˜drastic cutsâ€™ or the constant referral to â€˜everybodyâ€™. Certain words are repeated throughout the article so that key bits of information are not forgotten by the reader. For example, â€˜healthierâ€™ or â€˜healthyâ€™. Overall, the style of writing is extremely positive - everything â€˜willâ€™ be better in the future and there is no doubt in these assertions. In the BBC article, we are presented with a much more informal document. Little asides or parenthetical brackets are used to address the reader directly and ask questions the reader will feel obliged to answer. This makes the tone of the text very chatty. The contributions from the environmentalists are written in direct speech, which also adds to the sense of being involved in a conversation. The use of fact and opinion is interesting in these two texts, particularly in the Environment Agency's vision statement. This is a government document, so it is seeking to canvass support from the reader, and convince the reader of how well the Government is doing and how it intends to achieve great things in the future. The events of the future cannot possibly be known, yet this account of the future of the environment is presented as fact. This is typical of political documents, because politicians need to convince the public that there is no doubt that plans can fail. Therefore, we have a series of opinions presented as facts. The BBC article is a mixture of facts and opinions. The actions the environmentalists are taking to help the environment are facts, whether or not they do help is a matter of opinion. Like the government document, there is no discussion about how the information presented might be interpreted differently. There is an assumption that the reader believes these opinions to be true and, therefore, gives the opinions the status of fact, but they are not. Finally, the purposes of these two texts are very different. The BBC article seeks to inform in a light-hearted way - it is not didactic. There are suggestions that could be followed, but this is not a text written to provoke the reader into sudden and dramatic activity. Really, it presents some ideas to be thought about and maybe acted on if possible. The Government document seeks to convince the electorate that the environment is in good hands and that the future of it is safe. The language needs to be inspiring, so the document is written in a way that should leave no doubt that everything will be much better in the future. Itâ€™s curious, but I am more convinced that the suggestions in the BBC text are valid and truthful than the assertions made in the Government document. This is perhaps because it is human nature to assume that governments veil the truth in clever language and that this text is trying too hard to be optimistic. So, as a result, I am less inclined to believe it.	6

In this Revision Bite, we will look at two texts and use 'Mind the GAP' to help us pick out the important information in each text. The Test Bite will help you to 'Make a LIST' and then you will have all the information you need to try the comparative essay question. Click on the links to open the texts in a new browser window. It is recommended that you print both texts out. It would be a good idea to print out the texts so that you can make notes on them as you would in the exam. You will have the chance to do this on the next page. Once you have printed the texts, or have them open in other windows, spend a few minutes reading through. You will need them with you to work through the rest of this Revision Bite.	6
Text 1 is an article from a website. Below is a screenshot of the original web page that the article was taken from. Certain features have been numbered. Can you spot the features that are only found on web pages? Can you find all the features unique to web pages? Check the table below.	6
What type of publication do you think text 2 is? A comic? A newspaper? A magazine? A web page? A business document? Text 2 - what is it? This one isn't so easy, so let's rule some things out... A comic: No. Comics are generally brightly coloured and full of cartoons. This isnâ€™t! A newspaper: No. Newspapers generally use narrow columns, black and white print and the pages are very full when you look at them. A web page: No. There are no giveaway clues such as 'click here', 'contact us', 'print this page' - so it canâ€™t be a web page. A business document: You are pretty close - text 2 comes from the Environment Agency. This is from the booklet the organisation would give to members of the public if they asked for information about what the Government is doing to protect and improve the environment. Text 2 is actually a vision statement from the Environment Agency.	6
"What is the purpose of this? Since we know this is a vision statement from the Environment Agency, we know that it was written by the government. Ask yourself; what do governments want? What do governments want? So, how does text 2 do this? Which of the following statements about text 2 do you agree with? ""The document is informing the public about legislation"" ""It suggests what the Government wants to do to improve the environment"" ""This document wants to maintain public support of the Government"" Text 2 does give suggestions about what the Government wants to do to improve the environment and it does seek to show the public that the Government cares about the environment. Although it implies that there will be legislation, it does not give any information about specific Acts of Parliament."	6
Establishing the GAP for each of the texts will help you write what the examiners want to see in your exam paper. Remember, they want to see that you have really understood the purpose of the documents and can prove it by analysing the content and format. In the exam, you will be asked some questions that refer to the content of both documents, but individually and finally you will be asked to compare some aspect of the documents. To do this well, it really helps to remember â€˜Make a LISTâ€™. Spend a few minutes making notes about the Language, Information, Style and Tone of both texts. When you have done this, try the Test Bite. This will help you to discover more about the Language, Information, Style and Tone of these texts.	6
The Revision Bites in this section of Bitesize are designed to help you revise for the AQA exam: Paper 1, Section A: Reading response to non-fiction/ media texts. In this part of the exam, you will be asked to read at least two texts. They will be non-fictionnon-fiction: A text that presents facts, opinions, judgements, advice or description ie its contents are not made up, or fantasy. Also a category of literature that may present itself in a variety of formats - newspaper, magazine, web page, instruction manual, leaflet, advertisement. documents. You will have to answer questions about the texts and then write a piece in which you compare them. Don't worry if you're not sitting the AQA examination, this material will still help you revise for your exam. Try the 'Mind the GAP' and 'Make a LIST' activity to check your understanding of this topic. The relevant part of the OCR exam is: Paper 1, Non-fiction, media and information, Section A: Response to unseen reading: non-fiction/ media. The relevant part of the Edexcel exam is: Paper 2, Unseen media, Section A: Unprepared media texts.	6
When reading a non-fiction text, you need to be able to assess whether the information in the text is fact or opinion. You will also need to be able to comment on the writer's line of thought or their argument. This Revision Bite will help you to learn the difference between fact and opinion and how to follow an argument through a non-fiction text. One useful question to ask yourself when you start reading a non-fiction text is how much use the author has made of factfact: Something that is known or believed to be true or real; or something whose existence can be proved. and opinionopinion: A belief or judgement that is held by a person as the truth, but cannot be proved as true.. It's a basic difference, but one that examiners are interested in because it tells you whether a writer is trying to inform you or persuade you. Recognising a fact from an opinion is not that difficult. But it isn't so much telling them apart that will get you the marks - it's whether you can say how the author has used fact and opinion.	6
"The first statement: ""Every year, hundreds of thousands of calves like this one are separated from their mothers within four days of birth""is a fact. Why? Because, even though the numbers are not supported by evidence, they could be. Even if they are not absolutely accurate (""hundreds of thousands"" is a bit vague), it is certainly true that large numbers of very young calves are taken from their mothers. The second statement: ""Why? To satisfy our unnatural and unhealthy taste for cow's milk"" is an opinion. Why? Because it could never be proved whether or not a taste for cow's milk is either unnatural or unhealthy. It's just a matter of opinion, however strong people's feelings may be."	6
"How the reader responds to a non-fiction text is very important. The following techniques illustrate how the Vegan Society's leaflet has been designed to affect the reader's response. Facts are usually presented to readers in cold and objective language, but use of vivid or persuasive language can affect how you feel about the information being given to you. This is emotiveemotive: Designed to make the reader feel something strongly. language. The fact in the first statement begins to work on your emotions. ""hundreds of thousands of calves"" This sounds an awfully big and uncomfortable number. Using facts emotively softens you up for the emotive words in the opinion that come next in the article. ""to satisfy our unnatural and unhealthy taste"" The use of the words 'unnatural' and 'unhealthy' is the opinion of the author. There is no proof given in the article to back this statement up as fact. The use of pictures is always important in getting a message across. Think about how effectively you may have seen them used in other campaign leaflets. You can't really call a photograph a fact or an opinion - but the camera can sometimes lie, or at least put forward a particular point of view. Pictures are a very powerful way of stirring emotions and selling a product - just take a look at the covers of magazines next time you are in a newsagent. The photo of the calf on the leaflet is factual in that it's of a real calf, but it's also emotive because it looks sweet, appealing and frightened, and seems to be trapped in a grim little pen. Now that you know the power of fact and opinion separately, think about how and why you might use fact and opinion together."	6
"Mixing fact and opinion is a very skillful way to present information to achieve a particular purpose. Think about the following statement. ""The modern dairy cow is nothing more than a milk machine...milked 2-3 times a day."" ""The modern dairy cow is nothing more than a milk machine"" = opinion. A cow is clearly not a machine. This is an opinion expressed through very emotive language. ""milked 2-3 times a day."" = fact. This is an uncontroversial fact and is used to support the opinion previously stated."	6
To get high marks in an exam, you have to understand how language is used, because when it comes to non-fiction text every word is designed to achieve a specific effect. So how do you go about unpicking the language of a text? A lot of people have trouble answering questions on language, because it's hard to know where to start. When the author of a text is trying to persuade you to believe an opinion, you'll often find they use language that appeals to your emotions. This emotiveemotive: Designed to make the reader feel something strongly. language can be extreme at times, but can also be deceptively subtle. Emotive language can sound very convincing, but you have to decide if the writer is using it to twist the meaning and manipulate your response. Ask yourself why the author is using emotive language. Are you being persuaded to form a particular opinion about a subject or agree with a particular point of view? Have a look at this text and see if you can pick out any of the emotive language for yourself. The sight has become all too familiar: drunken yobs, hunting in packs, degrading themselves and shaming the flag of their country. Heavy drinking, violence and racial hatred is all part of the culture of young Britain, and is generally followed by whines and bleats of self pity when those trusted with upholding the law are pushed to take action. Now, just to ensure that you've spotted the emotive language above, look at this text and compare the two. The sight has become familiar: drunken young men, travelling in groups, letting themselves and their country down. Heavy drinking, violence and racial hatred is all part of the culture of young Britain, and is generally followed by expressions of self pity when the local police take action. The two texts say the same thing, on the surface. Yet the furious attitude of the first one comes over strongly. How? Now spend a few minutes going back over the two texts you've just read and pick out other emotive language.	6
Another key word describing the way an author uses language is tone. One of the best ways to examine tone is to read or listen to a speech. These people all used a combination of their voice and words to communicate messages that were important to them. Obviously, some people are better at this than others. Why do you think this is? Tone is difficult to define, but if you really want the higher grades, you will need to spend time getting to grips with it. Look at the separate Revision Bite on Tone to learn how to identify and comment on different types of tone.	6
One of the most important questions to think about when you are reading a non-fiction text in your English exam is: What is the text trying to do (its purpose)? In other words - why was the text written? If you can answer this question, you'll easily be able to move on to writing about other aspects of the text such as its formatformat: each application saves files in a format it can read, eg Microsoft Word saves files with the *.doc extension and the language it uses. You will find that they're all linked together. Non-fiction texts can be written for a variety of purposes. Non-fiction texts are usually written with a purpose to explain, inform or persuade.	6
"One purpose of the Red Cross advertisement is to get people to send money to the charity, so it has to appeal to the reader in some way. Consider what attitude the writer of the advertisement has towards the readers. ""That's what we do, now it's your turn."" ""That is what Red Cross workers do."" ""Did you know..."" ""Every little bit really does help."" The large bold headline - HELP - lets the reader know immediately that this advertisement is serious in tone. The photographs of the hungry child and the person being rescued back up this theme. Think about that headline again. What would be your first impression of the tone if the headline was followed by an exclamation mark (HELP! )? In the exam, you need to think about why writers would use these attitudes. Think about the type of language they use to get their attitude across."	6

Check out the ten golden rules that will help you achieve a better mark in your exam; read an examiner's mark scheme to find out what grade your essay would get and spot some classic mistakes now, so that you don't make them in the exam! Decide on your brief: the genregenre: A category or type of something. Fiction and non-fiction are examples of two genres. (or format), your audience and the purpose for writing. You'll usually be asked to write about something that you've just read about in the exam, so make notes and highlight any points you can use in your own writing, but don't copy! Get the beginning, middle and end in shape: lead the reader through your argument. Structure the piece to help your reader navigate through your main points. It should create maximum impact. You need to know where and how you are going to stop. If you're writing to a particular format, like a letter, make sure you get it right. You have to keep the examiner interested! Remember the audience you are writing for and use appropriate language. Try to keep your tone consistent - this usually means avoiding slang. At the end of the exam, check the full stops, commas, sentences, paragraphs and the classic spelling mistakes that might lose you marks, like getting your apostrophes in the wrong places.	6
If you have read through the Reading non-fiction section, you will be familiar with 'Mind the GAP'. As with Reading non-fiction, you still need to assess your genre, audience and purpose before you begin to write to argue, persuade or advise. This Revision Bite will remind you what you should be thinking about before you start to write. In the exam, you will be told which genregenre: A category or type of something. Fiction and non-fiction are examples of two genres. you should be writing for, so this part is easy. Just remember the common features of the different genres - eg the layout of a formal letter, or the fact that newspapers use headings and sub headings. Here is a list of genres that have appeared in this section of the exam.	6
Once you've started writing - stick to the structure, but try to make your writing flow easily from one point to the next. Fluency means leading your reader smoothly through your writing, controlling the pace and linking points together. It's no good having brilliant thoughts if they come out in an unconnected jumble. Keeping it fluent is down to handling a few simple, but very important, linking words: but... and... therefore... so... although... moreover... consequently... thus... but... however... whilst... which... that... also... though... yet. Keep in the forefront of your mind the audience for whom you are writing - your tone must be consistent throughout, so watch the language that you use. If you've organised that final paragraph, you'll leave your audience KNOWING your main ideas or your opinion. The final sentence is vital here - it might be open-ended and balanced, or it might be a passionate point of view. The ending says a lot about how well you have put your writing together - and it stays longest in the reader's memory.	6
It is important that you leave a few minutes at the end of your exam to check through what you have written. Spelling mistakes and grammatical errors can lose you vital points and are easily spotted with careful checking. Also, when you read through what you have written, you can check that it flows properly and that your tone is consistent. Some boys are writing a letter to the local council about building a skateboard park. Dear Sir/Madam, We, the skateboarders of Chiswick need a ramp or other skateboard fascility near or in the Chiswick area where all the skaters can skate safely free from hassle and crime or vandalism. People think skateboarders cause trouble and are a niusance but that is not true, we should be taken seriously because we take an interest in our sport and need somewhere to practise if we got this ramp we would take care of it and make sure it was maintained properly. Yours sincerely, We're looking at a first draft - there are lots of mistakes, and in order to be taken seriously, they've got to be eliminated. Give yourself a minute to check through the letter and look for errors. Remember to check the opening sentence and tidy up the mark losers. How did you do?	6
If you are following AQA, you will not need to read this section. If you are following Edexcel or OCR, you will need to read this section. If you are following Edexcel or OCR courses you will be asked to write, analyse, review or comment as well as persuade, argue and advise. Both pieces of writing will be based on unseen texts. If you have worked through the Reading non-fiction sections of this revision site you will have seen how to understand and interpret a non-fiction text; you will have looked at how and why it was written and presented in the way that it was. This is what you need to understand for an exam that tests you on writing to analyse, review or comment. What you must remember is that your writing is being tested as well as your understanding. Analyse: carry out a detailed study, looking for understanding and interpretation. Review: general survey or a report assessing the features of a document. Comment: to give an opinion or an explanation. All these skills are covered within the Reading non-fiction section of this website. If you are not sure which exam board you are studying with, please ask your teacher.	6
What do you need to remember about this genre? Endings and beginnings, Dear Madam = yours faithfully, Dear Mr Smith = yours sincerely. The layout of a letter, address, date etc. Your Member of Parliament, a politician. What sort of tone is appropriate for the audience? To argue that the way dairy cows are kept is cruel. What do you want? A change in the law, to make dairy farming less cruel to cows.	6
Now that you have the information you need to include in your letter, you need to make a plan. Here are three possible introductions to this letter. Which one do you think is most appropriate? Dear Ms Hill MP, I am writing to you to express my disgust at the way dairy cows and their calves are treated in this country. I wholeheartedly hope that you are as dismayed as me when you read the following and will try to bring about a change in the law. Dear Ms Hill MP, The treatment of cows in this country is disgusting and I want something done about it. Dear Ms Hill MP, I am writing to express my concerns about the treatment of dairy cows; I really feel that we should treat these animals in a more humane and compassionate way. I would like a change in the law to ensure that, in the future, these animals are treated with more respect and care. The introduction that is most appropriate is Introduction C. Introduction A does introduce the subject, but it is far too aggressive in tone, whereas Introduction B provides little introduction and is far too angry in tone. Introduction C introduces the subject, says what you would like to happen and is written in a formal, but not aggressive way.	6
You should now feel confident about the skills you need when writing to argue. This exercise will show you the importance of structure, punctuation and correct spelling.

My friends spent two weeks of hell in a half-finished hotel that was advertised as 'a new jewel in the crown of this most gorgeous island'. Our opinion was rather different after our two week nightmare in this rain-soaked building sight. I have several reasons for complaining, but the main one is that ther were no facilities what so ever. The promised gyms and golf course were still an architects pipe-dream and shopping mall was a simple outdoor market that packed up whenever it started too rain. We were warned that the weather could be changable, but it never changed once: it rained for a fortnight! A further reason is that the flight to Paloma was delayed so that we missed nearly a day of our holiday by spending a day in Manchester Airport's departure lounge: this ended up being the high-point of our holiday since we were dry, warm and well-fed. This brings me to my next area of complaint. Food. There was non. Your brochure stated food was 'plentiful and traditional' and that it was available day and night. It was, in fact, available for fourteen days and nights because we marked a quiche and it was still there after forteen days. Furthermore there were many builders on the hotel sight who made the holiday something of an ordeal by having to endure their catcalls, whistles and innuendoes. Luckily, we could not understand what they were shouting, otherwise you might have been answering a charge of discrimination and verbal abuse. The builders were our only form of entertment as we soon became dependnt upon them for repairs to our room in order to make it safe and to make runing repairs to the solitary pice of 'disco equipment': a Dansette record player and some old LP's. Therefore, after having endured two weeks of this ordeal, I feel that I and my friends are deserving of at least a sizeable refund or we will be forced to take this matter further and may reliese our photographs to the press. Now have a look at the model answer to compare your corrections.	6

Before you write anything, you must write a plan setting out the key areas you intend to cover. It doesn't matter if the plan is short. Take a look at this example - we've called the headteacher Mrs Seddon. People who used to go to the school who will remember the headteacher Mrs Seddon - ex-pupils and staff. To tell ex-pupils and staff that Mrs Seddon is retiring and to inform them that there is going to be a party, a collection for a leaving present etc. Formal, but friendly. It should also be inviting.	6
As well as analysing texts, you need to be able to write about them successfully. Think about your audience, the genregenre: A category or type of something. Fiction and non-fiction are examples of two genres. of your text and the main point of your analysis. By staying focused you will write more effectively. We can all improve our writing, however experienced we are! Here are a few tips and tricks.	6
With an initial structure in mind, you can start to develop more detail in your story. Your plan is essential to give your story direction. A brief, but clear plan acts as a kind of map to guide your writing and stop you getting lost half-way through your piece. Without a plan you might fall into the trap of accidentally starting a novel! You will be marked on your ability to tell your story clearly. To begin with you should think about the sequence of events. This basic structure will help you to shape your ideas and begin to make a plan.	6
Try writing a plan for a horror story choosing options from each of the main story ingredients below and putting them together. Setting and time - choose one Character - choose one or more Problem - choose one or more Climax - choose one Resolution - choose one	6
"Writing reads better when the sentences in your paragraphs vary in length but if you want to create a tense atmosphere, you can use lots of short sentences. If you want to show that lots of things are happening at once, use a long sentence. A list of words, or descriptions together in a sentence make the narrator seem excited, desperate or afraid. The passage below is from Lord of the Flies by William Golding. The main character, Ralph, is being hunted by another boy, and Ralph is afraid for his life. Ralph fumbled to hold his spear so that it was point foremost; and now he saw that the stick was sharpened at both ends. The savage stopped fifteen yards away and uttered his cry. Perhaps he can hear my heart over the noises of the fire. Don't scream. Get ready. The savage moved forward so that you could only see him from the waist down. That was the butt of his spear. Now you could see him from the knee down. Don't scream. A herd of pigs came squealing out of the greenery behind the savage and rushed away into the forest. Birds were screaming, mice shrieking, and a little hopping thing came under the mat and cowered. Five yards away the savage stopped, standing right by the thicket, and cried out. Ralph drew his feet up and crouched. The stake was in his hands, the stake sharpened at both ends, the stake that vibrated so wildly, that grew long, short, light, heavy, light again. Lord of the Flies, William Golding Think about how the extracts below create certain effects in William Golding's writing? 1. ""Don't scream. Get ready."" 2. ""The stake was in his hands, the stake sharpened at both ends, the stake that vibrated so wildly, that grew long, short, light, heavy, light again."" 3. ""Birds were screaming, mice shrieking, and a little hopping thing came under the mat and cowered."" Match the comments to the correct quotation. A. The writer shows the character's desperation and fear with a rhythmic list of descriptions within one long sentence. B. These short sentences create a tense atmosphere. The reader wants to read on quickly to find out what will happen. C. The writer uses a longer sentence to show that lots of things are happening at once, so that the reader can feel the character's sense of panic. Now that you understand how these techniques work in William Golding's writing, try them out in your own piece of work. But be careful to get the punctuation right!"	6
This exercise shows you how to create atmosphere in your writing. Itâ€™s easiest to do this from where you are right now, but instead you could imagine the sounds of a fictional place or somewhere youâ€™ve been before. If you can, take a moment to open the window of the room you are in. Concentrate on the sounds you can hear. Now take time to consider if there's a particular atmosphere created by these sounds that tells you about the place - do you get a feeling of excitement, chaos or blissful peace? You could use a list of these sounds to help you to describe a typical day in this place. What new sound would it take to change or disrupt this typical day?	6
The setting of a story will seem more real to the reader if they can imagine the smells, tastes and textures of a place as well as being able to imagine the sounds. Choose a place and start to focus on it. Now follow the instructions below and pause between each activity. Close your eyes, and focus on your breath. Slow your breathing down â€“ not so much that you are uncomfortable but just slow enough that you feel relaxed. Now try to imagine yourself in your chosen place. Take a moment to look around this place in your mind. What can you see? If you are outside, look at the sky. Are there any clouds? What precise colour is the sky? If you are on a beach, what colour is the sand? Look at the light on the sea. You may be in a room or building instead. Look around, filling in each detail of this place â€“ how high is the ceiling, what colour are the walls? How do you feel, physically? Are you pleasantly warm? Perhaps you can feel the sun on your skin, or maybe there is a slight chill in the air. Think of the textures surrounding you. Perhaps you can feel grass tickling your legs. Or soft, powdery sand between your toes. If you are in a room, concentrate on the texture of the floor. Is it soft carpet, smooth tiles, creaky floorboards or something different? Do you feel safe and happy in this place? Concentrate for a moment on how your surroundings make you feel. Now write down details of the place you have just visited in your imagination. Using the list below, write words and phrases each to jog your memory. Once you have made a list for each sense, see if you can describe the place for the reader.	6

"Hamlet is a tragedy set in ancient Denmark. The main protagonist [protagonist: The chief character in a literary work. ] is Prince Hamlet, the son of King Hamlet and Queen Gertrude. When the play opens, King Hamlet has recently died. Claudius, King Hamlet's brother, has been crowned the new King and has married Gertrude. Shortly after his mother's marriage, Prince Hamlet meets his father's spirit. People believe that King Hamlet was killed by a poisonous snake bite. However, the Ghost tells Hamlet that he was murdered by Claudius. Claudius killed the king by pouring poison into his ear while he slept. He says that Claudius has seduced Gertrude and stolen the throne. The Ghost tells Hamlet that ""The serpent that did sting thy father's life /Now wears his crown"". The spirit implores Hamlet to seek revenge: ""Let not the royal bed of Denmark be/ A couch for luxury and damned incest"". Hamlet needs proof that this is an ""honest ghost"" and not a ""goblin damn'd"". He feigns madness to allow him to observe Claudius and plot his revenge. Horatio is the only person who knows that Hamlet is pretending to be mad. Hamlet often talks to himself and questions his own plans and existence. At one point he comtemplates suicide: ""To be or not to be that is the question. Whether tis nobler in mind to suffer the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune or to take arms against a sea of troubles..."" Hamlet is in love with Ophelia, but pretends to be angry with her. He tells her he doesn't love her - ""Get thee to a nunnery, go: farewell."" She is shocked and upset. Polonius and Claudius see Hamlet shouting at Ophelia and are worried. Seeing Hamlet's irrational behaviour, Claudius decides to watch Hamlet closely: ""Madness in great ones must not unwatched go."" Hamlet puts on such a good act of being mad that it can be questioned whether Hamlet really has been driven mad. Hamlet puts on a play for Claudius in which a king is poisoned in his sleep. If Claudius really did murder the old King, Hamlet thinks that his reaction will prove his guilt: ""The play's the thing wherein I'll catch the conscience of the King."" On seeing the play, Claudius is shocked and angry, which convinces Hamlet that the Ghost was telling the truth. Claudius realises that Hamlet knows who murdered the old King and that his stepson is a threat. Finding Claudius alone and apparently praying, Hamlet plans to kill him: ""And now I'll do't""! However, he hesitates because Claudius' prayer may save his soul from being ""damn'd and black as hell"". He decides to kill him when Claudius is ""about some act /That has no relish of salvation in't"". Against the wishes of the Ghost, Hamlet turns his anger on his mother and her incestuous relationship with Claudius. He declares, ""Let not the royal bed of Denmark be/ A couch for luxury and damned incest"". In Gertrude's bedroom, he hears a noise behind a tapestry and thinks it must be Claudius. Hamlet is furious and stabs violently through the curtain, ""How now! A rat?"". However, Polonius is behind the curtain, spying on Hamlet to find out the cause of his madness. Hamlet has now killed Ophelia's father. Gertrude tells Claudius that Hamlet's insanity caused him to kill Polonius. Claudius decides not to have him tried for murder but convinces Hamlet to leave for England with two of his friends, Rosencrantz and Guildenstern. Claudius convinces Rosencrantz and Guildenstern to take a secret letter to the King of England. The letter asks for Hamlet to be sentenced to death for murder. Ophelia, already struggling to cope with Hamlet's madness, learns of her father's death and is driven insane. While collecting flowers, she drowns in a stream. While sailing to England, Hamlet's ship is attacked by pirates. Hamlet survives and returns to Denmark to meet Horatio. They see a grave being dug (a grave that will be Ophelia's). Hamlet picks up an unearthed skull which he learns is that of the court jester, ""Alas, poor Yorick! I knew him, Horatio; a fellow of infinite jest, of most excellent fancy"". Hamlet sees Laertes and Gertrude in the cemetery. Hamlet hides and when he overhears that the grave is Ophelia's, he is upset. Ophelia's brother Laertes has returned home from Paris for the funeral. He has learnt of Hamlet's part in his father and sister's deaths and when he sees Hamlet in the cemetary, he challenges him to a duel - a fencing match. Claudius sees this as a chance to be rid of Hamlet. He convinces Laertes to switch from the traditionally blunted sword to one sharpened and tipped with deadly poison, also adding poison to Hamlet's drink for extra security. Hamlet, Claudius, Gertrude and Laertes die in the final scene The duel begins but things quickly go wrong. Both Laertes and Hamlet become wounded by the poisoned blade. Gertrude, thinking her son is approaching victory, accidentally drinks from the poisoned cup. Seeing his mother die, Hamlet stabs Claudius saying ""follow my mother"". Hamlet drinks what is left in the cup and dies. Horatio is the only person left standing and laments ""Now cracks a noble heart. Good night, sweet prince, And flights of angels sing thee to thy rest!"""	6
To understand the context [context: The factors surrounding a text which help us to understand it; the background events which help to explain something. ] of the play, it's helpful to know a little about J B Priestley's life and his political views during the early 20th century - a time of great global change. He wrote An Inspector Calls after the First World War and like much of his work contains controversial, politically charged messages. Keen to pioneer a new 'morality' in politics, Priestley's chief concerns involved social inequality in Britain and the need for nuclear disarmament. John Boynton Priestley was born in Yorkshire in 1894. He knew early on that he wanted to become a writer, but decided against going to university as he thought he would get a better feel for the world around him away from academia [academia: An academic community, usually a university. ]. Instead, he became a junior clerk with a local wool firm at the age of 16. When the First World War broke out, Priestley joined the infantry and only just escaped death on a number of occasions. After the war, he gained a degree from Cambridge University, then moved to London to work as a freelance writer. He wrote successful articles and essays, then published the first of many novels, The Good Companions, in 1929. He wrote his first play in 1932 and went on to write 50 more. Much of his writing was ground-breaking and controversial. He included new ideas about possible parallel universes and strong political messages. During the Second World War he broadcast a massively popular weekly radio programme which was attacked by the Conservatives as being too left-wing. The programme was eventually cancelled by the BBC for being too critical of the Government. He continued to write into the 1970s, and died in 1984.	6
This was the period of the Russian Revolution, two appalling world wars, the Holocaust and the Atom Bomb. Priestley deliberately set his play in 1912 because the date represented an era when all was very different from the time he was writing. In 1912, rigid class and gender boundaries seemed to ensure that nothing would change. Yet by 1945, most of those class and gender divisions had been breached. Priestley wanted to make the most of these changes. Through this play, he encourages people to seize the opportunity the end of the war had given them to build a better, more caring society.	6

During the 1930's Priestley became very concerned about the consequences of social inequality in Britain, and in 1942 Priestley and others set up a new political party, the Common Wealth Party, which argued for public ownership of land, greater democracy, and a new 'morality' in politics. The party merged with the Labour Party in 1945, but Priestley was influential in developing the idea of the Welfare State which began to be put into place at the end of the war. He believed that further world wars could only be avoided through cooperation and mutual respect between countries, and so became active in the early movement for a United Nations. And as the nuclear arms race between West and East began in the 1950s, he helped to found CND, hoping that Britain would set an example to the world by a moral act of nuclear disarmament.

The Birling family are spending a happy evening celebrating the engagement of Sheila Birling to Gerald Croft - a marriage that will result in the merging of two successful local businesses. Yet, just when everything seems to be going so well, they receive a surprise visit from an Inspector Goole who is investigating the suicide of a young girl. The questions he asks everyone relating to the case reveal that they all have secrets linking them to the tragedy [tragedy: A type of drama in which characters undergo suffering or calamity, and which usually ends with a death. A sad or catastrophic event causing suffering or death. ]. The Birling family are holding a dinner party to celebrate the engagement of Sheila to Gerald Croft, the son and heir of Mr Birling's rival in business. Although there are a few signs that not everything is perfect (Mr Birling is a bit too anxious to impress Gerald, Eric seems rather nervous and Sheila playfully rebukes Gerald for not having come near her the previous summer) there is a happy, light-hearted atmosphere. When the ladies leave the men to their port, Mr Birling has a 'man to man' chat with Gerald and Eric, advising them that a man needs to look after himself and his own family and not worry about the wider community. As he is telling them this, the door bell rings. Inspector Goole enters, an impressive, serious man whom none of them has heard of.	6
When Sheila enters, the Inspector reveals that he would also like to question her about Eva Smith's death. He tells Sheila that Eva's next job was at a big shop called Milwards, but that she was sacked after a customer complained about her. When she too is shown a photograph of the girl, Sheila is very affected. She admits that it was her fault that Eva was sacked: when Sheila had gone in to try on a dress that didn't suit her, she had caught Eva smirking to another shop assistant - in her anger, Sheila had told the manager that if Eva wasn't fired, Mrs Birling would close their account. Sheila is hugely guilty and feels responsible for Eva's death. When the Inspector then states that Eva, in despair, changed her name to Daisy Renton, Gerald Croft's involuntary reaction reveals that he knew her too. When the act ends, the audience is poised to find out what part Gerald had to play in her death.	6
Sheila is glad to have heard this confession from her fiancÃ©, although Mrs Birling is scandalised. Once Gerald has left to go for a walk and get over the news of Daisy's death, Inspector Goole shows a photograph to Mrs Birling. She grudgingly admits that she had seen the girl two weeks previously, when the girl - now pregnant - had come to ask for financial assistance from the Brumley Women's Charity Organisation. Mrs Birling was the chairwoman and persuaded the committee to turn down the girl's appeal on the grounds that she had the impudence to call herself Mrs Birling and because she believed that the father of the child should bear the responsibility. She says the girl refused to let the father of the child support her because she believed money he had given her previously to be stolen, yet Mrs Birling is proud of refusing the girl aid. She claims that she did her duty and sees no reason at all why she should take any blame for the girl's death.	6
There is a bitter meeting between Eric and his parents, which the Inspector interrupts so that he can question Eric. Eric tells the story [story: A sequence of events in writing or spoken word. ] of his own involvement with the girl. He had met her in the same theatre bar as Gerald, had got drunk and had accompanied her back to her lodgings. He almost turned violent when she didn't let him in, so she relented and they made love. When he met her two weeks later they slept together again and soon afterwards she discovered that she was pregnant. She did not want to marry Eric because she knew he didn't love her, but she did accept gifts of money from him until she realised it was stolen. Eric admits that he had taken about Â£50 from Mr Birling's office - at which Mr and Mrs Birling are furious.	6
The Birling family are spending a happy evening celebrating the engagement of Sheila Birling to Gerald Croft - a marriage that will result in the merging of two successful local businesses. Yet, just when everything seems to be going so well, they receive a surprise visit from an Inspector Goole who is investigating the suicide of a young girl. The questions he asks everyone relating to the case reveal that they all have secrets linking them to the tragedy [tragedy: A type of drama in which characters undergo suffering or calamity, and which usually ends with a death. A sad or catastrophic event causing suffering or death. ]. The Birling family are holding a dinner party to celebrate the engagement of Sheila to Gerald Croft, the son and heir of Mr Birling's rival in business. Although there are a few signs that not everything is perfect (Mr Birling is a bit too anxious to impress Gerald, Eric seems rather nervous and Sheila playfully rebukes Gerald for not having come near her the previous summer) there is a happy, light-hearted atmosphere. When the ladies leave the men to their port, Mr Birling has a 'man to man' chat with Gerald and Eric, advising them that a man needs to look after himself and his own family and not worry about the wider community. As he is telling them this, the door bell rings. Inspector Goole enters, an impressive, serious man whom none of them has heard of. Inspector Goole announces that he has come to investigate the suicide of a young working-class girl who died that afternoon. Her name was Eva Smith. After seeing a photograph of her, Birling admits that she used to be one of his employees: he discharged her when she became one of the ring-leaders of a strike asking for slightly higher wages. Birling justifies sacking her by saying he paid his workers the usual rates; he cannot see that he has any responsibility for what happened to her afterwards. When Sheila enters, the Inspector reveals that he would also like to question her about Eva Smith's death. He tells Sheila that Eva's next job was at a big shop called Milwards, but that she was sacked after a customer complained about her. When she too is shown a photograph of the girl, Sheila is very affected. She admits that it was her fault that Eva was sacked: when Sheila had gone in to try on a dress that didn't suit her, she had caught Eva smirking to another shop assistant - in her anger, Sheila had told the manager that if Eva wasn't fired, Mrs Birling would close their account. Sheila is hugely guilty and feels responsible for Eva's death. When the Inspector then states that Eva, in despair, changed her name to Daisy Renton, Gerald Croft's involuntary reaction reveals that he knew her too. When the act ends, the audience is poised to find out what part Gerald had to play in her death. After some tense words between Sheila and Gerald, an attempt by Mrs Birling to usher the Inspector away and the revelation that Eric Birling is a hardened drinker, Gerald admits that he too had known Daisy Renton. He had met her at the local Variety Theatre - known to be the haunt of prostitutes - and had 'rescued' her from the unwelcome attentions of Alderman Meggarty, a local dignitary. When he found out that Daisy was almost penniless, Gerald let her stay in the flat of a friend of his and she became his mistress. He ended the affair when he had to go away on business, giving her some money to see her through for a few months. Sheila is glad to have heard this confession from her fiancÃ©, although Mrs Birling is scandalised. Once Gerald has left to go for a walk and get over the news of Daisy's death, Inspector Goole shows a photograph to Mrs Birling. She grudgingly admits that she had seen the girl two weeks previously, when the girl - now pregnant - had come to ask for financial assistance from the Brumley Women's Charity Organisation. Mrs Birling was the chairwoman and persuaded the committee to turn down the girl's appeal on the grounds that she had the impudence to call herself Mrs Birling and because she believed that the father of the child should bear the responsibility. She says the girl refused to let the father of the child support her because she believed money he had given her previously to be stolen, yet Mrs Birling is proud of refusing the girl aid. She claims that she did her duty and sees no reason at all why she should take any blame for the girl's death. Right at the end of the scene [scene: In a drama, a piece of action that occurs in one place without interruption. ], as Mrs Birling denounces the father of the child and claims he needs to be made an example of, Sheila (and the audience) realise that Eric is involved. When Eric comes into the room, the act [act: In drama an act is a section of the performance, usually made up of a number of scenes. ] ends. There is a bitter meeting between Eric and his parents, which the Inspector interrupts so that he can question Eric. Eric tells the story [story: A sequence of events in writing or spoken word. ] of his own involvement with the girl. He had met her in the same theatre bar as Gerald, had got drunk and had accompanied her back to her lodgings. He almost turned violent when she didn't let him in, so she relented and they made love. When he met her two weeks later they slept together again and soon afterwards she discovered that she was pregnant. She did not want to marry Eric because she knew he didn't love her, but she did accept gifts of money from him until she realised it was stolen. Eric admits that he had taken about Â£50 from Mr Birling's office - at which Mr and Mrs Birling are furious. All the Birlings now know they played a part in the girl's death. Mr and Mrs Birling are concerned about covering up their involvement, whereas Sheila and Eric are more aware of the personal tragedy [tragedy: A type of drama in which characters undergo suffering or calamity, and which usually ends with a death. A sad or catastrophic event causing suffering or death. ] and feel guilty. The Inspector leaves, after delivering a strong message about how we all should be responsible for each other. After he has left, and the family has begun to consider the consequences of what has been revealed, they gradually begin to wonder about the Inspector. Was he real? When Gerald returns from his walk he explains that he also had suspicions about the Inspector and had found out that there is no Inspector Goole on the force, which Birling confirms with a phone call. They gradually realise that perhaps the Inspector conned them - he could have showed each person a different photograph - and when they telephone the infirmary, they realise that there hasn't been a suicide case for months. Birling is delighted, assuming they are now all off the hook, while Sheila and Eric maintain that nothing has changed - each of them still committed the acts that the Inspector had accused them of, even if they did turn out to be against five different girls. Then the telephone rings. Mr Birling answers it, and after hanging up tells the family that it was the police on the line: an inspector is on his way to ask questions about the suicide of a young girl...	6
The characters we see as the curtain rises are not the same as those at the plays conclusion. The events of the evening change everyone, as well as their expectations of the future. Inspector Goole is instrumental in disturbing the harmony; a purposeful, mysterious character who forces the characters to confront each other's social responsibility, snobbery and guilt. But is the inspector as genuine as he seems? All these changes take place because of the visit of Inspector Goole. But who is Inspector Goole? And who is the girl whose suicide he is apparently investigating?	6

But is the inspector as genuine as he seems? All these changes take place because of the visit of Inspector Goole. But who is Inspector Goole? And who is the girl whose suicide he is apparently investigating? Of course, we never see Eva Smith on stage in the play: we only have the evidence that the Inspector and the Birlings give us.	6
"As you read the play, it is important to imagine yourself watching and listening to the action. It is a drama not a novel! The stage directions [stage directions: Instructions written into the script of a drama to guide the performers' actions. ] are important in helping us to imagine exactly what is going on: they can help us picture each character's actions and reactions. In the course of An Inspector Calls the Birling family and Gerald Croft change from a state of great self-satisfaction to a state of extreme self-doubt. The play is in 'real time' - in other words, the story lasts exactly as long as the play is on the stage. So, what happens in a comparatively short time to create such a dramatic contrast [contrast: A description of all the differences between two things (in this case, two texts). ]? How is the drama maintained and the audience involved? Think about these points. The Setting and Lighting are very important. Priestley describes the scene in detail at the opening of Act 1, so that the audience has the immediate impression of a ""heavily comfortable house."" The setting is constant (all action happens in the same place). Priestley says that the lighting should be ""pink and intimate"" before the Inspector arrives - a rose-tinted glow - when it becomes ""brighter and harder."" The lighting reflects the mood of the play. The dining room of a fairly large suburban house, belonging to a prosperous manufacturer. It has good solid furniture of the period. At the moment they have all had a good dinner, are celebrating a special occasion, and are pleased with themselves. There are subtle hints that not is all as it seems. For example, early on we wonder whether the happy atmosphere is slightly forced. Sheila wonders where Gerald was last summer, Eric is nervous about something, Lord and Lady Croft did not attend the engagement dinner. This arouses interest in the audience - we want to find out what is going on!"	6
There is dramatic irony [dramatic irony: An occasion where the audience knows more than the characters do. ]. For instance, the audience knows how wrong Mr Birling is when he makes confident predictions about there not being a war and is excited about the sailing of The Titanic: famously, the ship sank on her maiden voyage. This puts the audience at an advantage over the characters and makes us more involved. The Birlings' Living Room There is a lot of tension [tension: A feeling of potential conflict between a group of people. In an audience or reader, a sense of potential conflict, or a feeling of anxiety due to what may be about to happen. ] as each member of the family is found to have played a part in Eva's death. New pieces of information contribute to the story being constructed. The audience is interested in how each character reacts to the revelations.	6
"There are numerous changes in tone [tone: The mood or manner of a text or part of a text. The author's 'tone of voice' or way in which they expect to be understood. The emotional load carried by a text. ]. For instance, Mr Birling's confidence is soon replaced - first by self-justification as he tries to explain his part in Eva's death, and then by anxiety. Timing of entrances and exits is crucial. For example, the Inspector arrives immediately after Birling has told Gerald about his impending knighthood and about how ""a man has to look after himself and his own."""	6
Because Eva was a woman - in the days before women were valued by society and had not yet been awarded the right to vote - she was in an even worse position than a lower class man. Even upper class women had few choices. For most, the best they could hope for was to impress a rich man and marry well - which could explain why Sheila spent so long in Milwards. For working class women, a job was crucial. There was no social security at that time, so without a job they had no money. There were very few options open to women in that situation: many saw no alternative but to turn to prostitution. Why did Priestley decide to hinge his play on the death of a young working class woman rather than the death of a young working class man?	6
To put Macbeth into perspective, you'll need to know a little about William Shakespeare and why the play is still so popular over 400 years after it was first performed. William Shakespeare was born in Stratford upon Avon in 1564. His father sold gloves and became an important person in the town. William, one of eight children, was the eldest son and was probably educated at the local grammar school. He married when he was only 18 and his wife, Anne Hathaway, was eight years older than him. They had two girls and a boy (who died aged 11). Nobody knows how Shakespeare began to write or when he entered the theatre, but we know that he became a leading member of the theatre troupe known as 'The Lord Chamberlain's Men'. The company proved very popular and later, when King James I granted them the right to perform at his court, the troupe became known as 'The King's Men'. Shakespeare wrote over 30 plays for 'The King's Men', making it the most important theatre company in the country, and he often wrote parts for particular actors. He was very successful and wealthy in his time, and his work has remained very popular ever since.	6
Macbeth is one of Shakespeare's best known plays. There are all sorts of reasons for this but perhaps the main one is that the basic story still strikes a chord with modern audiences. It is a bloodthirsty tale of ambition, and the evils we will go to in order to get what we want. We follow the central character, Macbeth, as he plots and kills in order to become king. And as soon as he is crowned, we watch as his world falls apart around him. The play is considered very unlucky - actors shouldn't even say the word 'Macbeth' if they aren't on the stage performing it. So that's why people talk about 'The Scottish play', or 'The Comedy of Glamis', or even just 'The Play'. In fact, anything but Macbeth (luckily it's okay to write it). One reason for keeping quiet is that some people thought Shakespeare didn't just include witches as characters in his play, he actually wrote real magic spells in some of the lines. Because of this, the play was cursed - legend has it that an actor died on the opening night, and lots of others have died since. Macbeth has been filmed a number of times and adapted for stage in all sorts of ways. For instance, there have been versions with over a hundred witches on the stage, versions set in Nazi Germany, versions with Zulu warriors and even a rock opera.	6

In your coursework you should be aware of the story of Macbeth. The play opens as three witches plan a meeting with the Scottish nobleman Macbeth, who at that moment is fighting in a great battle. When the battle is over, Macbeth and his friend Banquo come across the witches who offer them three predictions: that Macbeth will become Thane of Cawdor and King of Scotland, and that Banquo's descendants will become kings. Banquo laughs at the prophecies but Macbeth is excited, especially as soon after their meeting with the witches Macbeth is made Thane of Cawdor by King Duncan, in return for his bravery in the battle. He writes to his wife, Lady Macbeth, who is as excited as he is. A messenger tells Lady Macbeth that King Duncan is on his way to their castle and she invokes evil spirits to help her slay him. Macbeth is talked into killing Duncan by his wife and stabs him to death. No-one is quite sure who committed this murder and no-one feels safe, but Macbeth is crowned king. Now that Macbeth is king he knows the second prediction from the witches has come true, but he starts to fear the third prediction (that Banquo's descendants will also be kings). Macbeth therefore decides to kill Banquo and his son, but the plan goes wrong - Banquo is killed but his son escapes. Macbeth then thinks he is going mad because he sees Banquo's ghost and receives more predictions from the witches. He starts to become ruthless and kills the family of Macduff, an important lord. Macbeth still thinks he is safe but one by one the witches' prophecies come true, Lady Macbeth cannot stop thinking about Duncan, becomes deranged and dies. A large army marches on Macbeth's castle and Macbeth is killed by Macduff. This is just the basic story and there are lots of extra characters and details you can include. However, do not fall into the trap of retelling the story in your essay - you will get no marks for it because the examiner already knows what happens. Instead, use the plot to support your work and ideas. Let's have a look at how you can do this next. Act I - The witches begin their manipulation of Macbeth.	6

Act II - Lady Macbeth bullies Macbeth into committing the murder of Duncan, he immediately regrets what he's done. Act III - Macbeth begins to eliminate those he believes threaten his position. Act IV - Macbeth arranges the murder of Macduff's family. Act V - Macbeth is beheaded by Macduff after a lengthly duel between the two men. In your work you need to show how different events fit together. This means you should know the basic storyline and what other parts of the plot are relevant to your task. If your task is about a particular scene, you should know what has already happened and what happens after the scene. Imagine you are looking at Act 2, Scene 1 (which finishes with Macbeth killing Duncan). You can use the plot in all sorts of ways, but remember to focus on your task or title. So imagine you are discussing the relationship between Macbeth and Lady Macbeth. The plot is a very important element in your work, but only if you use it sensibly. If you end up just retelling the story, you are not making the most of your knowledge.	6
There are over twenty named characters in Macbeth, plus various other roles. However, you do not need to refer to many of these and, depending on your task, you might just focus on one or two characters. The starting point is to sort out who they are, how they develop and how they relate to each other. We know that Macbeth is a brave and valiant soldier, ready to die for his king, Duncan. However, the prophecies of the witches have a powerful effect on him, especially when he learns the first has come true, and he becomes the Thane of Cawdor. He thinks more and more about being king, and he is easily persuaded to agree to murder Duncan. However, he often appears weak - he starts to have visions, he asks lots of questions, he cannot make a decision and never really seems sure of himself. For instance, he panics just after the murder and has to rely on his wife to find an alibi. Later in the play he appears to be more in control and less reliant on his wife. For instance, he plans to murder Banquo without even telling his wife. He also ignores his visions and makes decisions quickly, giving orders rather than asking questions. At times he is full of confidence but he is also distant and seems to ignore the death of his wife. When he realises he will also die, he 'will not yield' and fights to the very end. Knowing the facts about a character is only the start - we need to be able to use these effectively. One way to do this is to have details or quotes from the play to support our ideas.	6
Banquo is Macbeth's close friend and ally. He knows about the witches and their predictions but doesn't take them seriously at first. Later he thinks more about it, but he is never tempted in the way Macbeth is. However, he starts to realise how interested Macbeth is and then gets suspicious of him. Banquo is also presented as a very brave and completely loyal soldier - even when Macbeth tempts him Banquo makes it clear he wants to keep his 'allegiance clear' to the king. Duncan is the king at the start of the play. He is presented as a strong ruler. For instance, when he finds out the first Thane of Cawdor is a traitor, he immediately executes him and puts Macbeth in his place. He is also perceptive, and knows that you can't always tell who is a traitor. He is respected by everyone. However, he perhaps leads Macbeth into thinking about murder - Duncan announces that his son, Malcolm, will become the next king, and this starts Macbeth thinking of ways he might become king himself. The Witches introduce the play and control the mysterious forces of the world. They know the future and seem to put Macbeth under their spell. Their magical words are well-known, such as 'Double, double toil and trouble, fire burn and cauldron bubble. Macduff is the lord who first finds Duncan's body and who eventually kills Macbeth. He is seen as completely loyal to Duncan and his country. He is brave, swearing to investigate the murder and he doesn't go to see Macbeth crowned. This implies Macduff is already suspicious. He then goes to England to raise an army and his family are murdered on Macbeth's orders. He convinces Malcolm to join his attack against Macbeth. He kills Macbeth in the final battle because he is not 'of woman born' (he was born by caesarean section) - it's as if he has some magical power because only he can kill Macbeth. The Murderers - there are two of these (but a third, unknown murderer joins them when they attack Banquo). They are men who have nothing to lose and will set their 'life on any chance'. In other words, they are desperate and ready for anything. Malcolm is Duncan's son and is named as the Prince of Cumberland, so will inherit the throne from his father. However, when his father is murdered he runs away to England. He returns later and is convinced by Macduff to join the attack against Macbeth.	6

Lady Macbeth is another central figure in the play and we can make the same sort of notes about her character as we did for Macbeth. There are a number of other characters you might want to look at and the following section gives a brief outline of their characters and relationships. Banquo is Macbeth's close friend and ally. He knows about the witches and their predictions but doesn't take them seriously at first. Later he thinks more about it, but he is never tempted in the way Macbeth is.

When we are talking about dramatic effect, we are basically talking about how we experience the play in a theatre. Shakespeare didn't try to make his plays seem realistic and there were very few props or scenery. This means the audience had to use their imaginations. This is most obvious with Macbeth's hallucinations - for example, he thinks he sees a dagger or sees Banquo's ghost at the banquet. Some productions might want to show these visions (perhaps using a projector), but most audiences (including Shakespeare's) would imagine it - we can't see these visions because we haven't committed his crimes or have the same feelings of guilt. Also, it is important to remember how people watch a play in the theatre - we can't stop the actors to make a cup of tea, and there's no book to put down or DVD to pause. This seems very obvious but it's easy to forget. For instance, in Act 2, Scene 1 we have the build up to Duncan's murder and we have to think about how an audience would experience this. They don't fast-forward to the scene but bring all sorts of ideas with them.	6
Imagine we are looking at Act 2, Scene 1. In order to understand how dramatic effect is created in this scene we need to put it into context. We've already met the witches, heard about the predictions and know that Macbeth has plotted to murder Duncan in the next few hours. At the start of the scene we find Banquo and his son alone after midnight in the courtyard of a castle. An audience would therefore expect a sinister mood - the atmosphere of the scene is dark and tense because we are waiting to find out what happens next. Banquo and Fleance are suddenly disturbed so Banquo reaches for his sword - will we see a fight? It is a 'friend' though, Macbeth, and he is choosing his words carefully. He seems to be happy, but as soon as he is alone we know differently. A theatre audience naturally realises his confusion, and how alone he is at this point. His wife wouldn't even recognise his feelings, and his best friend would kill him as a traitor. This is exactly what dramatic effect is all about - how feelings are created.	6
Drama is created in all sorts of ways, such as using sound effects, leaving characters on stage alone or switching from one event or group of characters to another. Quite a lot is left to the imagination, for instance we do not see the actual battle in the beginning, the execution of the first Thane, the killing of Duncan or Lady Macbeth's suicide. However, Shakespeare uses all sorts of other theatrical tricks to make us understand just how awful the violence is. For example, Macbeth disappears to kill Duncan and we hear an owl shriek. He then enters 'with two bloody daggers'. He and his wife both hear noises and then he tells her about hearing a voice cry out to him. He daren't even look again at Duncan's body and when Lady Macbeth leaves, he hears a knocking noise. This noise happens four times, reinforcing its importance for the audience and making Macbeth increasingly worried. With the final knock he says simply, 'Wake Duncan with thy knocking: I would thou couldst'. It is as if Macbeth has given up, he is not thinking of becoming king but of his terrible crime, and that is exactly what the audience are thinking about too.	6
Shakespeare also makes use of dramatic irony, which is when the audience knows something which characters in the play do not. For instance, Duncan greets Macbeth without suspecting a thing and Duncan thinks the castle (where he is to be murdered) is 'pleasant' and 'sweetly recommends itself'. Dramatic irony is used here to bring the audience into the play - we know what is happening but feel powerless to do anything The key to understanding dramatic effect is to think about the feelings being created in the audience. It's not about reading the play but experiencing it. And the feelings we have are not accidental, but created by putting certain events together, or by explaining a character's thoughts and motivations, or by suggesting what will happen next. We might feel anger, disbelief, sympathy or fear. Try to include something about dramatic effect in your work, as it shows you understand how the play works.	6
When we are talking about dramatic effect, we are basically talking about how we experience the play in a theatre. Shakespeare didn't try to make his plays seem realistic and there were very few props or scenery. This means the audience had to use their imaginations. This is most obvious with Macbeth's hallucinations - for example, he thinks he sees a dagger or sees Banquo's ghost at the banquet. Some productions might want to show these visions (perhaps using a projector), but most audiences (including Shakespeare's) would imagine it - we can't see these visions because we haven't committed his crimes or have the same feelings of guilt. Also, it is important to remember how people watch a play in the theatre - we can't stop the actors to make a cup of tea, and there's no book to put down or DVD to pause. This seems very obvious but it's easy to forget. For instance, in Act 2, Scene 1 we have the build up to Duncan's murder and we have to think about how an audience would experience this. They don't fast-forward to the scene but bring all sorts of ideas with them. Imagine we are looking at Act 2, Scene 1. In order to understand how dramatic effect is created in this scene we need to put it into context. We've already met the witches, heard about the predictions and know that Macbeth has plotted to murder Duncan in the next few hours. At the start of the scene we find Banquo and his son alone after midnight in the courtyard of a castle. An audience would therefore expect a sinister mood - the atmosphere of the scene is dark and tense because we are waiting to find out what happens next. Banquo and Fleance are suddenly disturbed so Banquo reaches for his sword - will we see a fight? It is a 'friend' though, Macbeth, and he is choosing his words carefully. He seems to be happy, but as soon as he is alone we know differently. A theatre audience naturally realises his confusion, and how alone he is at this point. His wife wouldn't even recognise his feelings, and his best friend would kill him as a traitor. This is exactly what dramatic effect is all about - how feelings are created.

Once you have understood how to use the plot and the characters, you should move onto the themes. Using themes in your work makes it far more interesting - you are no longer just thinking about Macbeth as if it was a true story. Instead you are looking at the play and thinking about Shakespeare's choices - why does he keep contrasting appearance and reality? Why are certain characters tempted by evil? And does the supernatural have a part to play in our lives? Perhaps the most obvious subject or theme in Macbeth is ambition and we see this with both Macbeth and Lady Macbeth. They are tempted by the idea that Macbeth will become king - Macbeth is not sure what to do but his wife is ruthless in getting what she wants - she views her husband as a coward and appears ready to do anything. Ambition leads to evil - it makes Macbeth stronger and more determined, but then destroys his wife - she goes mad. And ambition eventually kills him as well, because he becomes a tyrant and so loses the support of his friends.	6
Another major theme is the supernatural - the idea that there are mysterious forces controlling what is happening in our lives. The very first characters we meet are the three witches, and their prophecies are what drives the story forward. In Shakespeare's time belief in witchcraft was very strong and many so-called witches were burnt at the stake. It is not surprising that his audience would have taken these ideas seriously and felt that Macbeth was somehow possessed. There are lots of references to this - he is unable to say 'Amen', he has visions, he is disturbed and even thinks no-one can kill him. The final battle scene also contains many elements of the supernatural. Macbeth believes he is invincible because many of the witches' prophecies appear impossible to fulfil - and yet just as the witches predicted Birnam Wood does indeed move to Dunsinane, and Macbeth is killed by Macduff because he is not 'of woman born'.	6
The contrast between what is real and the appearance of something is also used by Shakespeare. The classic dagger scene, when Macbeth is not sure if he can trust his eyes, is only one of many references to this theme. For instance, he sees Banquo's ghost at the banquet and Lady Macbeth imagines blood on her hands. The contrast between reality and appearance is also shown with all the references to thoughts, dreams and actions. Banquo talks about the 'cursed thoughts' he has had and his dreams of the witches. Macbeth talks of the world of thought and dreams and sometimes is stuck there. For instance, Lady Macbeth is critical of Macbeth's 'foolish thoughts' and talks of him being 'lost' because of this. Sleep is another theme associated with reality, because characters view it as vital to life, but like death or being in another world. Macbeth is told he has murdered sleep and will 'sleep no more' whilst Lady Macbeth thinks of sleep as death, calling it the sternest 'goodnight'.	6
Loyalty and guilt are also strong themes in Macbeth. Duncan clearly values loyalty - he has the first Thane of Cawdor executed and rewards Macbeth by making him the new Thane. Shakespeare cleverly uses loyalty as a dramatic device as well - Duncan is in the middle of talking about 'absolute trust' when Macbeth walks in - we know he's already thought about killing Duncan, but for the moment he talks about 'the loyalty I owe' and his 'duties' to Duncan. Loyalty is also very important to Banquo - he will not desert Duncan. Macbeth, however, has an odd idea of loyalty - he knows he is doing the wrong thing, but he still goes ahead. Early on in the play perhaps it is his wife who is manipulating him, but later on it is Macbeth who makes the decisions. And later on he also starts to show he hates disloyalty, threatening his messengers and servants. Macbeth also shows his guilt - he is unsure before the murder and regrets it immediately after. Lady Macbeth is the opposite - she seems to show no guilt at the time and even talks about how 'a little water' cleans away the blood. Her increasing madness later on is a sign of her guilt and she imagines her hands to be stained with blood. There may be other topics you can spot, such as violence, destruction and tyranny. It's good to include something about the basic ideas within Macbeth in your own work. This will help you understand what the play is about, how it all fits together and how Shakespeare used ideas to frighten, shock and entertain his audiences.	6

We have already looked at one aspect of language - in the section on character we saw how you could use short quotations as evidence. We might want to say that Macbeth is not afraid to die at the end of the play. We can then support this view by looking at his language. Macbeth says for instance, 'I'll fight till from my bones my flesh be hack'd' and he also insults people who he thinks are afraid. Here we are using two ways of providing evidence - words that are directly from the play are put in quotation marks (such as 'I'll fight till from my bones my flesh be hack'd').' The second way is to describe what is said in your own words (for example, he insults people). It's often good to combine these methods, perhaps quoting just one word from the play. For instance, we can make the point that Macbeth has a conscience because he is unhappy about being disloyal and he cannot say 'Amen' after he has committed the murder The one thing you should avoid is using a long quotation - many students write out whole chunks of the play and this is just like retelling the story - there is no reason for it and you'll get no marks for it.	6
"We can also deal with language in Macbeth by looking at the techniques Shakespeare used. Some of these techniques (and names) might seem difficult at first. If that's the case, just think about what the play would sound like if the technique was not used. ""Thing's aren't what they seem, you know"" Well, yes, it is easy to understand but it is not something unusual or interesting, and it doesn't seem to be something a witch might want to say anyway. ""Fair is foul, and foul is fair"" Suddenly it's not so obvious what Shakespeare is getting at. This is also a lot more complex and interesting - opposing ideas are put together and the actual meaning seems to be a paradox - how can something fair be foul, and something foul be fair? Let's have a look at this next."	6
"""Fair is foul, and foul is fair"" We know the witches are in the middle of a storm and perhaps they are saying that they like this; they are witches so they enjoy bad things and are on the side of evil. However, they could also be saying that what we think looks attractive (or 'fair') is actually bad (or 'foul'). In other words, our ambitions can be our downfall. Or they could be warning us of things to come in the play - Macbeth is tempted by their predictions and enters a confused, unnatural world, where he cannot trust what he sees and cannot bear what he is. Perhaps now we can appreciate Shakespeare's skill as a writer - many of his characters say things which are ambiguous. This means that you can interpret them in different ways, so the witches might be talking about the weather, or they might mean something completely different. Another example of ambiguity is when Lady Macbeth says the daggers 'must lie there' - she could mean the daggers must be placed there, but also that the daggers will hide the truth and pin the blame on the servants."	6
"Imagery is used a lot in Macbeth. This is when strong pictures or ideas are created in our minds. For instance, the play has lots of references to darkness, to sleep, to disease and even to blood. Metaphors is when one thing is called something else. For instance, when Macbeth wants to defend his lands against others, he uses metaphors from medicine - he wants to find the 'disease' in Scotland, to restore it to 'health' and to use a 'drug' against others. Personification is where something is described as if it is human, so the ""Dark night strangles the travelling lamp"". Similes is when a direct comparison is made (with 'as', 'than' or 'like'), so Banquo says that the witches ""look not like the inhabitants o'the'earth"" or Macbeth says something ""moves like a ghost""."	6
"Opposite words or ideas are also frequent in Macbeth - they highlight conflicts in the story such as appearance and reality, choice and fate or good and evil. At times the opposites are in terms of single words, such as 'heaven' or 'hell'. The technical term for this is antithesis, when words are deliberately chosen to contrast. For instance, we have 'foul' and 'fair' from the witches and even Lady Macbeth says what has 'quenched' the servants has given her 'fire' (she means it's made them tired, but made her alert). Repetition is also used frequently in Macbeth - repeating a word or phrase draws attention to it. Sleep no more!Macbeth does murder sleep', the innocent sleep,Sleep that knits up the ravell'd sleeve of care In fact the word 'sleep' is repeated 8 times in just 10 lines. Again, this is no accident - Shakespeare really wants the audience to be aware of what sleep means to his characters - sleep is like death, but it's also an escape from the worries of the world. By concentrating on the word 'sleep' we can see how Macbeth has put Duncan to sleep (he's killed him) and now will no longer sleep (or relax) again. Another important technique in Macbeth is the use of soliloquies. These are speeches but they are meant to be heard only by the audience. They tell us directly about a character's thoughts and feelings and they are very important in Macbeth, because we can understand exactly what is going through a character's mind. Perhaps the most famous is in Act 2, Scene 1, which starts: ""Is this a dagger I see before me"". Without this soliloquy, we would have no idea just how confused Macbeth is."	6
Most tasks allow you to write or talk about how language is used in the play. So imagine your title is: 'How does Macbeth change during the course of the play?' Our first impression of Macbeth is of a strong, brave leader. He has fought hard and is called 'noble Macbeth' by Duncan. However, we also see how interested he is in the witches' predictions - he asks 'Tell me more' and wishes they had stayed. His aside 'Glamis, and Thane of Cawdor' has the same function as his soliloquies later on - only the audience hears this, so other characters, such as Banquo, have no idea what is on Macbeth's mind. This combines much of what we have covered so far - it starts to answer the question without filling up the page with irrelevant facts, plot details and fancy technical terms. Remember, you don't have to tick off the language terms like a trainspotter. Instead show you appreciate some of the techniques Shakespeare used and the effects they have on his audiences.	6

Typical questions ask you to show how a character develops during the play, or how a theme is presented in the play, or to look closely at a scene in the play. Each of these tasks mentions one main topic - for example, the first is about Macbeth, so it's about character. However, you will also have to deal with a number of other topics in your answer. For instance, you should look at how he speaks, so you are looking at language. You could also look at his part in the plot, how he is used for dramatic effect and the themes he talks about. We could look at each question in the same way. For instance, an answer to question 3 above should cover what Act 2, Scene 1 adds to the overall plot, the characters in the scene, the dramatic effects (that is the main part of the question! ), the themes in the scene and the language the characters use. In other words, try to look at a range of topics in your answer. Markers are always pleased to see answers which cover plot, character, dramatic effect, theme and language.	6
The best way is to start answering your question straight away. It will help you focus on what is really important, and it will help you decide what extra ideas you need as you develop your answer. Version Two:Macbeth and Lady Macbeth are at the heart of the play - they provide the ambition, the justification and the actions which drive the events forward. Our first view of them is of a close, caring couple. Macbeth doesn't treat her as a passive, submissive wife. Instead she is his equal and his letter calls her his 'dearest partner'. She, on the other hand, seems tougher and more business-like. She says she wants to 'pour my spirits' into his ear and we quickly see how determined she is. For instance, when they meet Macbeth calls her his 'dearest love' but her response is to ask where Duncan will go after his visit. This might be a first draft but already it has a good focus on the question. Working like this allows you to plan your answer around the question, which is far better than just writing everything you know about the play. Remember, there is nothing wrong with including extra detail but you only get marks for what is relevant.	6
The final thing to remember is there are lots of ways of answering the same question. You don't have to follow a set plan, or include things in a fixed order. It helps if you have a range of ideas, especially if they are connected to the plot, characters, dramatic effects, themes and language. Stick to what is relevant and don't be afraid to put a personal reaction in as well - it shows you have engaged with the text and not just copied ideas you have heard. So, imagine our task is 'How is the theme of ambition dealt with in Macbeth?'. There are all sorts of ways of answering this - one answer might start with different aspects of ambition, another answer with the language of ambition and another with the dramatic effects created. However, try to plan the start of an answer using the character of Macbeth as the focus. Once you've done that, compare your ideas with the answer below. 'How is the theme of ambition dealt with in Macbeth?' One of the main themes in Macbeth is ambition and from the start we can see just how tempted Macbeth is at the thought of becoming king. He recognises his 'black and deep desires' but writes to tell his wife at length and is increasingly torn by a 'suggestion' that killing Duncan will make the witches' predictions come true. Macbeth recognises where ambition can lead and the contrast between what he thinks he should do, and his inner thoughts. His language reflects this, using antithesis such as 'heaven or to hell'. In fact, his very first words are 'So fair and foul a day'. This repeats what the witches have been saying and it would be obvious to an audience in Shakespeare's day that Macbeth is already associated with the evil the witches represent. There are many approaches you can take to the same question. This is only the start of the task and there is a lot more you could add, but it is a fine introduction because it keeps to the point as well as using a range of relevant details combined with personal thoughts.	6
To put The Merchant of Venice into perspective, you'll need to know a little about William Shakespeare, the city of Venice during the 16th century, and attitudes towards Jews in Shakespeare's England. William Shakespeare was born in Stratford upon Avon in 1564. His father was a glove merchant and a prominent local dignitary. William, one of eight children, was the oldest son. He was probably educated at the local grammar school. He married Anne Hathaway in 1582, aged18; his wife was eight years older than him. They had a daughter, followed by twins two years later. Their only son, Hamnet, died aged 11. Nobody knows how Shakespeare began to write or when he entered the theatre. At some point he joined an acting company called the Queen's Men and then became a leading member of the Lord Chamberlain's Men. They developed into London's top theatre company, performing at the Globe Theatre from 1599 and becoming the King's men when James I came to the throne in 1603. Shakespeare probably began writing plays in the 1580s and went on to write more than thirty. These would all have been performed by his theatre company: he may have acted some of the roles himself and certain parts would have been written with particular actors in mind. Certainly his work was very popular: by 1597, Shakespeare was wealthy enough to buy New Place, the grandest house in Stratford! The Merchant of Venice was written between 1596 and 1598 and first published in written form in 1600. He also wrote poems, including many love sonnets [sonnets: Poems which are usually written in the iambic pentameter rhythm and are 14 lines in length. ] which are mysteriously dedicated to a Mr W H. Shakespeare died in 1616 on his 52nd birthday. He is known the world over as the greatest playwright [playwright: A writer or maker of plays. Note the spelling: it comes from the same derivation as 'wheelwright' (a maker of wheels) and has nothing to do with the word 'write'! ] ever.	6
The Doge's Palace, Venice Venice was famous as an important Mediterranean trading centre for goods from the Far East. Silks, spices, jewels and other expensive items were bought and sold there - including slaves. It had the reputation of being full of fashion, culture and sophistication. It would have been a very exotic location for an Elizabethan audience. Venice was run by a Duke, or Doge, and a Council of Ten, who ruled with an iron fist. All Venetians were encouraged to do whatever they had to for the security of the state, even spying on other ports. People who were seen to have committed a crime against the state were often killed without trial and their bodies were left in the street to serve as a warning to others. Because of Venice's position as a centre for trade, it was full of people of many different nationalities, religions and races. The Christian leaders were keen to quell the activities of the Jews, and so created one of the first Jewish ghettos, forcing the Jews to live in a particular area. Yet the Jewish community continued to flourish in spite of the prejudice shown against them. Belmont, Portia's home, is an imaginary setting. All we know about it is that it is two days' sail away from Venice. It seems to be a beautiful, rich country estate.	6
Money-lenders preying on Christian debtors Although Jesus Christ himself was born a Jew, there have been battles between Jews and Christians for 2000 years. This is because the Romans who then ruled the area where they lived - now known as Israel - tried to crush the Jewish faith. Many Jews moved away to escape persecution, taking their customs and cultures with them. Through their hard work and consequent success in business, Jews were often resented in their new homes, especially in Christian countries. Terrible crimes were committed against them. In England, when Shakespeare was writing, Jews had been banished for the past 300 years. Shakespeare's audience would not have known any Jews; their knowledge of Jews would have been based solely on rumour and prejudice. They would have enjoyed the verbal insults and racist jokes against Shylock, and would probably not have questioned the treatment Shylock receives as we do today. The worst ever persecution of Jewish people occurred comparatively recently, before and during World War II (1939 - 45). The Nazi party convinced the Germans that the Jews were responsible for the country's economic problems and so began the Holocaust: 6 million Jews were killed in Germany and other European countries, many in gas chambers at concentration camps. The Diary of Anne Frank will give you some idea of the horrors of that time. And, unfortunately, Jews are still being persecuted in different countries around the world today.	6
To put The Merchant of Venice into perspective, you'll need to know a little about William Shakespeare, the city of Venice during the 16th century, and attitudes towards Jews in Shakespeare's England. William Shakespeare was born in Stratford upon Avon in 1564. His father was a glove merchant and a prominent local dignitary. William, one of eight children, was the oldest son. He was probably educated at the local grammar school. He married Anne Hathaway in 1582, aged18; his wife was eight years older than him. They had a daughter, followed by twins two years later. Their only son, Hamnet, died aged 11. Nobody knows how Shakespeare began to write or when he entered the theatre. At some point he joined an acting company called the Queen's Men and then became a leading member of the Lord Chamberlain's Men. They developed into London's top theatre company, performing at the Globe Theatre from 1599 and becoming the King's men when James I came to the throne in 1603. Shakespeare probably began writing plays in the 1580s and went on to write more than thirty. These would all have been performed by his theatre company: he may have acted some of the roles himself and certain parts would have been written with particular actors in mind. Certainly his work was very popular: by 1597, Shakespeare was wealthy enough to buy New Place, the grandest house in Stratford! The Merchant of Venice was written between 1596 and 1598 and first published in written form in 1600. He also wrote poems, including many love sonnets [sonnets: Poems which are usually written in the iambic pentameter rhythm and are 14 lines in length. ] which are mysteriously dedicated to a Mr W H. Shakespeare died in 1616 on his 52nd birthday. He is known the world over as the greatest playwright [playwright: A writer or maker of plays. Note the spelling: it comes from the same derivation as 'wheelwright' (a maker of wheels) and has nothing to do with the word 'write'! ] ever. The Doge's Palace, Venice Venice was famous as an important Mediterranean trading centre for goods from the Far East. Silks, spices, jewels and other expensive items were bought and sold there - including slaves. It had the reputation of being full of fashion, culture and sophistication. It would have been a very exotic location for an Elizabethan audience. Venice was run by a Duke, or Doge, and a Council of Ten, who ruled with an iron fist. All Venetians were encouraged to do whatever they had to for the security of the state, even spying on other ports. People who were seen to have committed a crime against the state were often killed without trial and their bodies were left in the street to serve as a warning to others. Because of Venice's position as a centre for trade, it was full of people of many different nationalities, religions and races. The Christian leaders were keen to quell the activities of the Jews, and so created one of the first Jewish ghettos, forcing the Jews to live in a particular area. Yet the Jewish community continued to flourish in spite of the prejudice shown against them. Belmont, Portia's home, is an imaginary setting. All we know about it is that it is two days' sail away from Venice. It seems to be a beautiful, rich country estate.

Antonio - The Merchant of Venice - is sad, but his friends cannot discover why. All the ships in which his money is invested are at sea, but he claims this is not what is worrying him - he has many ships, which makes good business sense. (In other words, he is not risking all his eggs in one basket.) His best friend, Bassanio, asks Antonio to lend him even more money than he already owes him, to help him win the hand of a rich and beautiful heiress, Portia. Antonio has not got any spare cash, but agrees to borrow money to help him. Portia complains about the restrictive terms of her father's will to her maid, Nerissa. She can only marry the man who correctly guesses whether her portrait lies within a gold, silver or lead casket. She wittily attacks the most recent batch of suitors, none of whom she would have dreamed of marrying. The only man she has ever met whom she thinks worthy of praise is Bassanio.	6
Shylock has been invited to dinner by Bassanio, but is nervous about the evening and feels that something is about to go wrong. He tells Jessica to take special care to lock up the house carefully while he is away - yet while he is gone, she elopes with Lorenzo, dressed as a young male torchbearer - carrying a large amount of Shylock's wealth with her! The Prince of Morocco chooses the gold casket and so loses his chance to marry Portia. Back in Venice, there is news of Shylock's rage on the discovery of his missing treasure and his missing daughter. There is also news that a galleon has been wrecked - could it be Antonio's? - and we hear that Bassanio had an emotional parting with Antonio before leaving for Belmont. The Prince of Arragon, another suitor for Portia's hand in marriage, chooses the silver casket and is also proved wrong. News reaches Portia that Bassanio has arrived.	6
Antonio's friends mock Shylock over the loss of his daughter. After news reaches Venice of the loss of another ship, Shylock, argues forcefully that he is just as much a man as a Christian and therefore will follow that the example the Christians set and seek revenge. When he hears that yet another of Antonio's ships has been lost, Shylock gleefully orders the arrest of Antonio. Although Portia urges Bassanio to take his time in choosing a casket (not wanting to lose him if he chose the wrong one), Bassanio goes ahead. He chooses the lead casket that contains Portia's portrait, to much rejoicing. Portia hands Bassanio a ring as a symbol of their love. Gratiano and Nerissa become engaged too. Jessica and Lorenzo arrive in Belmont- so all the lovers are together. Yet then news comes that disturbs their happiness. Antonio has sent Bassanio a letter telling him that all his ships have been lost. Portia sends Bassanio to Antonio straight away, with enough money to settle the debt to Shylock several times over. Antonio is in prison, longing to see Bassanio once more before he dies. Shylock is keen to have his pound of flesh. Portia and Nerissa leave Lorenzo and Jessica in charge of Belmont, saying that they are going to a convent during their husbands' absence. Yet Portia sends a letter to her cousin, asking for men's costumes and tells Nerissa that they will see their husbands again soon, disguised as men... Jessica tells Lancelot that Lorenzo has converted her to Christianity. She talks of how much she admires Portia.	6
The Duke hears the details of the case between Antonio and Shylock. He expects Shylock to be merciful, but Shylock refuses: he is determined to have his bond. He also refuses Bassanio's offer of 6000 ducats (double the amount owed), claiming his right to justice. He sharpens his knife, preparing to cut away the pound of flesh. Portia enters, disguised as a lawyer, Balthazar. Shylock is not swayed by Portia/Balthazar's arguments to be merciful either, nor by an increased offer of money, so Portia/Balthazar grants him his wish: the bond must be honoured. Shylock prepares to cut out a pound of Antonio's flesh from near his heart. Antonio prepares to die. At the last minute, Portia/Balthazar points out that the bond makes no mention of blood - so that if Shylock spills the smallest drop of Antonio's blood, his act is illegal. Shylock, realising he has been defeated, says he will simply take the 3000 ducats owed him, but Portia/Balthazar insists (as Shylock had himself insisted) that he must take the bond only. So, Shylock is left with nothing. Things then become even worse for Shylock, because Portia/Balthazar cites an ancient rule that says anyone who has attempted to kill a Venetian should be condemned to death and have their wealth confiscated. The Duke grants Shylock his life, but rules that his wealth should be split between Antonio and the state. Antonio requests that part of the money should go to Jessica. However, in a final humiliation, Antonio says that Shylock has to become a Christian. Antonio and Bassanio thank Portia/Balthazar for having saved Antonio's life, offering him money as a reward, but Portia/Balthazar will accept nothing but Bassanio's ring. He gives it away, reluctantly, at Antonio's request. Nerissa (acting as Balthazar's clerk) collects the ring and tells Portia that she will try to obtain Gratiano's ring in the same way.	6
Jessica and Lorenzo talk of love, comparing their own love to famous lovers in history. Portia and Nerissa arrive back in Belmont shortly before Bassanio and Gratiano, so that their husbands do not know that they have been away. The women mock the men about the loss of their rings, saying that they will not sleep with their new husbands until the rings are returned. Only when Bassanio has sworn eternal fidelity does Portia reveal the joke. Portia tells Antonio that three of his ships have been saved (so he is not ruined, as he had thought). Portia tells Jessica and Lorenzo that Shylock has given everything he has to them.	6
"As you read the play, it is important to imagine yourself watching and listening to the action. It is a drama [drama: A play or other performance in which events and dialogue are portrayed by actors on a stage; from the ancient Greek word for 'acting out'. Can also mean exciting or upsetting events. ], not a novel [novel: A long story that is published as a book. ]! Shakespeare provides us with very few stage directions [stage directions: Instructions written into the script of a drama to guide the performers' actions. ], so to help us imagine exactly what is going on, we need to picture each character's actions and reactions clearly. During the course of The Merchant of Venice we see comedy [comedy: A light-hearted drama that is played for laughs. ] and near-tragedy [tragedy: A type of drama in which characters undergo suffering or calamity, and which usually ends with a death. A sad or catastrophic event causing suffering or death. ]. We see three sets of lovers get together and almost see a man murdered on stage. There is much deception and disguise. The ending is full of celebration for most but despair for Shylock. So, what happens to create so many dramatic contrasts? How is the drama maintained and the audience involved? Various elements of the plot [plot: The sequence of events in a narrative; a story ] are woven together in such a way that we are often left on a mini cliff-hanger, wondering what will happen next. It's just like in a soap opera: we jump from place to place, picking up the story each time. ""'Nearest his heart'. Those are the very words."""	6
There are frequent changes in tone [tone: The mood or manner of a text or part of a text. The author's 'tone of voice' or way in which they expect to be understood. The emotional load carried by a text. ] in this play. The dream-like, fairy-tale world of Belmont First there is tonal contrast [contrast: A description of all the differences between two things (in this case, two texts). ] between two places: the world of downtown Venice - a gritty, male world dominated by business, politics and conflictconflict: disagreements between different interest groups - and that of Belmont, which is a dream-like, female space in which thoughts of love and marriage prevail. Then there are the frequent changes of tone in the action of the play: the atmosphere changes from love or comedy to cruelty from scene to scene, sometimes even within scenes - so much so that it's often hard to decide whether we are watching a comedy [comedy: A light-hearted drama that is played for laughs. ] or a tragedy [tragedy: A type of drama in which characters undergo suffering or calamity, and which usually ends with a death. A sad or catastrophic event causing suffering or death. ] or something in between. Equally noticeable are the changes in pace. For example, Act 2 is made up of lots of short scenes that rush us through the story of Jessica and Lorenzo's elopement. In contrast, Act 4 is one long scene taken up almost wholly by the trial, in whose complexities and emotions we are quickly caught up.	6
"""He was wont to call me usurer: let him look to his bond."" There is a lot of hostility between the Christians and the Jews of Venice, and this of course fuels the hatred between Shylock and Antonio. There is verbal abuse between the two groups. Shylock is keen to commit murder in the cutting out of the pound of Antonio's flesh. But the conflict is balanced to some extent by comedy. We can laugh at Lancelot's trick on his father, Gobbo, and at the bawdy jokes."	6
Dramatic irony [dramatic irony: An occasion where the audience knows more than the characters do. ] arises from the scenes involving disguise and deception. We, the audience, are aware that Lancelot is deceiving his old father, that Jessica dresses up as a boy, and that Portia and Nerissa are really Balthazar and his clerk. It's amusing because we know more than the characters on stage. As well as the main characters who people the various plots of the play, there are some 'commentator characters' like Solanio and Salarino, who fill in as narrators [narrators: Tellers of a story; the 'voices' in a text that describe or narrate the events of the plot; either characters in the story, or one ore more authorial voices who relate but take no part in events. ] and tell us about events we have not seen on stage. Some aspects of characterisation Shakespeare has left up to the play's director. For example, characters do not always tell us how they feel about something that has happened, so we have to rely on how they behave. Think about Jessica in Act 3, scene 2, when she arrives at Belmont with her new husband: how is she feeling? And how does Shylock react at the end of the trial scene (Act 4, scene 1)? A broken, grovelling Shylock would mean a very different ending from a defeated but defiant Shylock.	6

Portia promises to the characters on stage that she will answer all things faithfully at a later time, but we never see this happen, leaving a few unanswered questions."	6
There are various types of love explored in the play. From which characters do we learn about the different sorts of love? Which type of love is shown to be the strongest in the play? What about the tensions in some of the relationships? What is Shakespeare telling us about the nature of love? You could also comment on the love of possessions: would you say that Shylock loves money? Yet the play is also full of hatred. Which proves to be stronger, love or hate? Do you think that the play provides an answer? (It is worth considering that some productions miss out the final act [act: In drama an act is a section of the performance, usually made up of a number of scenes. ] and finish the play at the end of the trial. How would that alter what the play shows us about love and hate?)	6
There are many instances in the play when all is not quite as it seems. We, the audience, are aware of the disguises and deceptions with which some of the characters are involved. It is clear that we should not judge by appearances! Do you think that it is fair to deceive others, even for 'honourable' motives? Are there any characters in the play who, in your opinion, take deception too far? We could also question the 'appearance' of the Venetians - they call themselves Christians (and so ought to follow the teachings of the New Testament, loving their neighbours), but the reality is that they own slaves and persecute the Jews.	6

To put Much Ado About Nothing into perspective, you will need to know a little bit about William Shakespeare and why the play is still so popular over 400 years after it was first performed. William Shakespeare was born in Stratford-upon-Avon in 1564. His father sold gloves and became an important person in the town. William, one of eight children, was the eldest son, and probably educated at the local grammar school. He married when he was only 18 and his wife, Anne Hathaway, was eight years older than him. They had two girls and a boy (who died aged 11). Nobody knows how Shakespeare began to write, or when he entered the theatre. But we know he became a leading member of the theatre troupe known as 'The Lord Chamberlain's Men'. The company proved very popular, and later, when King James I granted it the right to perform at his court, became known as 'The King's Men'. Shakespeare wrote more than 30 plays for 'The King's Men', making it the most important theatre company in the country. He often wrote parts for particular actors, too. He was very successful and wealthy in his time, and his work has remained very popular ever since.	6
Much Ado About Nothing is one of Shakespeare's best-known plays. There are all sorts of reasons for this, but perhaps the main one is that the basic story still strikes a chord with modern audiences. The play is all about relationships between the sexes, and we meet two very different couples. One is exactly as we would expect a couple to be: they fall in love almost at first sight and appear ideally suited to each other. However, the man appears to be quite shallow and believes his wife-to-be has cheated on him. He leaves her, but is tricked into marrying her later on. The second couple are not together as a couple at all. They spend most of their time insulting each other, and both swear they will never marry. However, their friends trick them into falling in love, which they do, and they get ready to marry at the end. One of the most interesting ideas in the play is that the traditional couple are perhaps not really in love, but the odd couple are. The play contains two basic ideas which have been used in all sorts of films and stories. The first is that a couple have to overcome numerous obstacles before they can find true love. The second is that two very different people who start off arguing later fall in love, and everything ends happily. Because it is so popular, Much Ado About Nothing has been filmed a number of times and adapted for stage in all sorts of ways. For instance, there are versions set during the Second World War, one in India, and even a version with references to the mafia.	6

In your coursework, you should be aware of the plot. Don Pedro wins a war against his brother, Don John, and arrives with his men to stay with Leonato, the Duke of Messina. One of Don Pedro's friends, Claudio, falls in love with Leonato's daughter, Hero. A wedding is arranged and, as a light-hearted joke, a group of friends plan to trick Beatrice, Hero's cousin, and Benedick, another soldier, into falling in love. However, Don John also has a plan: he wants to spoil the wedding, and manages to convince Don Pedro and Claudio that Hero has been unfaithful before she is wed. Don John's servant is arrested, and the plan discovered. However, Dogberry, the captain in charge, is so useless the message is not passed on. Claudio arrives on the wedding day and refuses Hero, calling her a prostitute. Her family are persuaded to pretend she is dead. Later, the men realise they were tricked - Hero was completely innocent. To compensate, Claudio agrees to marry someone else, even though he cannot see her face during the ceremony. Afterwards, he is delighted to find out that Hero is still alive and he has just married her. The other surprise is that the other plan works: Beatrice and Benedick actually fall in love and at the end she accepts his marriage proposal. This is just the basic story. There are lots of extra characters and details you can include. However, do not fall into the trap of retelling the story in your essay. You will get no marks for it, because the examiner already knows what happens. Instead, use the plot to support your work and ideas. Act I - Early in the play the stubbornness of Benedick and Beatrice plays a big part in keeping them apart.	6
In your work you need to show how different events fit together. This means you should know the basic storyline and what other parts of the plot are relevant to your task. Imagine you are writing about Beatrice and her relationship with Benedick. You can use details from the plot to set the scene for when they first meet. This shows you appreciate what Shakespeare was trying to do. We have some clues to Benedick's character before we see him, and as soon as Beatrice and Benedick are together they insult each other. There must be a reason for this. Then we find out that Beatrice knows him 'of old'. It also seems important that Benedick continues his insults about women after Beatrice has left. As far as women go, he will 'trust none'. We can use details like this to work out the relationship between Beatrice and Benedick. We are therefore answering the question given to us. Just remember that you should not write out the entire plot. You only need to show what is happening at key points in the play.	6

Other aspects of the story, such as Dogberry's treatment of the prisoners, are not important, so you should ignore them. It all depends on your task. When you are using the plot you can pick incidents from right across the play, so long as they are relevant to your title. The plot is a very important element in your work, but only if you use it sensibly. If you end up just retelling the story, you are not making the most of your knowledge. After we have understood how to use the plot, we need to move to the characters.	6
There are over 20 named characters in Much Ado About Nothing, plus various other roles. However, you do not need to refer to many of them. Depending on your task, you might just focus on one or two. The starting point is to sort out who they are, how they develop, and how they relate to each other. Beatrice is unmarried and, because she is Hero's cousin, lives in Leonato's household. Right from the start, we see that she is clever, lively, and makes fun of lots of things. In particular, she makes fun of Benedick. She hints that she has already been in love with him, but spends a lot of the time publicly mocking him. She says she does not want to marry. This makes her seem very unusual, because in Shakespeare's day women were expected to. They were also expected to be quiet and polite, like Hero. Beatrice is not like this at all. She even turns down Don Pedro's proposal of marriage. He is a rich, powerful man, and this shows how unusual Beatrice is. She is independent and determined to stay that way. Beatrice is very loyal to Hero, and very strong and determined. Surprisingly, she is quick to believe Benedick is in love with her, and falls in love with him just as quickly. At the end of the play she seems truly happy - dancing with her husband to be. Those are the basic details of her character. We can now look at how to use these in your work. Knowing the facts about a character is only the start - we need to be able to use these effectively. One way to do this is to have details or quotations from the play to support our ideas.	6
Hero is Leonato's daughter, so comes from a wealthy and important family. She is typical of an unmarried Elizabethan woman, in that she is innocent and obeys her father. When in mixed company she is very quiet; she says more when with just women. Even when Claudio accuses her of being unfaithful, she says very little, and then faints. We can see just how passive she is when she later accepts Claudio as her husband. He has publicly humiliated her, yet she forgives him everything. Leonato is Hero's father. He is kind, protective of his daughter and friendly with Don Pedro. He is very pleased his daughter will marry, then shocked by the accusations against her. However, he is more worried about his honour than her. Leonato is determined to see Claudio pay for his behaviour, but then tricks him into marrying Hero at the end. Claudio is a traditional hero: he is young, brave, and falls in love with Hero at first sight. People like him and admire his courage. However, Claudio makes sure his bride is rich before he decides to marry her - is he really in love with her? He also seems to be immature, because he is easily tricked. He appears ready to believe rumours about Hero and treats her very badly at the church. When he thinks she is dead, he regrets his actions. However, he is then ready to marry someone else immediately afterwards. Don Pedro is the Prince and one of Benedick's best friends. He is confident, powerful and likes having fun. He helps Claudio by proposing to Hero. He later seems close to Beatrice, and even asks for her hand in marriage. However, we cannot be sure how serious he is. Don Pedro is the one who tricks Benedick and Beatrice, but in light-hearted way. Later in the play he appears very serious when he joins Claudio in insulting Hero. Don John is Don Pedro's illegitimate brother. In Shakespeare's time such people were seen as outsiders, even evil. Don John is no exception. He is largely silent and relies on his servant, Borachio, for ideas. When Don John speaks, he often talks about himself. And he spends his time plotting against Don Pedro and Don Pedro's friends. Don John is unpleasant and cunning. He knows how to spread rumours and destroy friendships. Dogberry is the leader of The Watch, an early police force. The entire force is made to look as silly as possible, making all sorts of mistakes and being useless at the job. Dogberry tries to speak in an impressive way, but says the wrong thing each time. He also acts like a clown. Dogberry does not know how to behave properly, so he exaggerates everything he does.	6

Knowing the facts about a character is only the start - we need to be able to use these effectively. One way to do this is to have details or quotations from the play to support our ideas. Along with Beatrice, Benedick is the other central figure in the play. We can make the same sort of notes about his character as we did for Beatrice. There are a number of other characters you might want to look at. The following section gives a brief outline of their characteristics and relationships. Hero is Leonato's daughter, so comes from a wealthy and important family. She is typical of an unmarried Elizabethan woman, in that she is innocent and obeys her father. When in mixed company she is very quiet; she says more when with just women. Even when Claudio accuses her of being unfaithful, she says very little, and then faints.

He also acts like a clown. Dogberry does not know how to behave properly, so he exaggerates everything he does.	6
When we are talking about dramatic effect, we are basically talking about how we experience the play in a theatre. The first thing to bear in mind is that the play is not meant to be real, or even look real. In Shakespeare's time all the actors would have been men. Even Hero and Beatrice were men dressed up as women. There were also very few props or scenery. This meant people in the audience had to use their imagination. It is almost like watching a pantomime nowadays: we know it is not real, but that is part of its charm. Secondly, it is important to remember how people watch a play in the theatre. We cannot stop the actors to make a cup of tea, and there is no book to put down or DVD to pause. This seems obvious, but it is easy to forget. For instance, in Act 4, Scene 1 we witness the build up to Hero and Claudio's wedding. Hero and her friends know nothing of Don John's plot and what has happened beforehand. However, the audience knows Claudio plan to reject her publicly. She will be alone and when this happens - even her father wishes she was dead. A theatre audience naturally feels sympathy for her. This is exactly what dramatic effect is all about - how feelings are created.	6
Chaille Stovall is making a movie about the 2000 presidential election. His friend Zac Skipp is helping him. Chaille (pronounced shal-ee) is only 11 years old! Party Animals is the name of Chaille Stovall's latest movie. The movie is about the 2000 presidential election. For the movie, Chaille talked to the two main candidates. He talked to Texas Governor George W. Bush at the governor's home. Chaille also traveled with Vice President Al Gore on his campaign bus. Chaille has been making films since he was 8 years old. Chaille's first movie was Boyz in Tights. The movie explored what people think about boy ballet dancers. Chaille won two awards for the movie. Chaille Stovall (CS): I decided to do a documentary [a true story film] called Boyz in Tights. Then people at HBO [a cable TV company] saw it, and they said they wanted to show the film. CS: It's mostly about the 2000 election. The movie asks why a kid should care about politics. CS: Very surprising. George W. Bush said his daughters weren't so happy with him running in the election because they didn't want to leave their school or stay inside all the time. When I first went to speak to Al Gore in New Hampshire, he knelt down in the snow. It was sort of like he understood children. They both seemed like very nice men. Filmmakers have their own language. Here are some words they use and their meanings.	2
"If he wins the election, Gore will stay in Washington, D.C., where he now lives. Gore also lived in Washington, D.C., as a kid. His father was a United States senator. Gore also spent time as a kid in Carthage, Tennessee. In Carthage, Gore's family owned a farm. Gore helped take care of the farm animals. Gore says he believes the hard work he did on the farm will help him be a good president. He has chosen Senator Joseph Lieberman to run for the vice presidency. On Election Day, voters will decide who will become our president and vice president. Weekly Reader asked Al Gore some questions. Here's what he had to say: Weekly Reader (WR): Who is your hero? Why? Al Gore (AG): My father and mother were heroes for me. I really respected the way they lived their lives. AG: Mr. Popper's Penguins, by Richard and Florence Atwater. I thought it was very funny. AG: Yes. I want to protect the environment--the air, the water, the land, and the Earth itself. Full Name: Albert Arnold Gore, Junior Birthday: March 31, 1948 Place of Birth: Washington, D.C. Family: Married to Mary Elizabeth, who is called ""Tipper."" Children: Karenna, Kristin, Sarah, and Albert III. Grandchild: Karenna's son, Wyatt. Pets: Two dogs, Shiloh and Daisy"	2
Just where the mighty Amazon, a river located in South America, starts had been a mystery. But a team of explorers has found the answer. The team says the Amazon begins on a mountain named Nevado Mismi. The mountain is in the country of Peru and is 18,363 feet high. It is part of the Andes mountain range. Freezing temperatures, strong winds, and rocky land made the mountain trip difficult for the explorers. They traveled by foot, car, bicycle, and even horseback. Even though the trip was hard, the team is happy to have solved the mystery.	2
You probably know that exercise is good for your body. But would you run all the way across the country to show kids that exercise is healthful? During the summer, Stu Mittleman ran from California to New York in 57 days. Mittleman covered 3,000 miles, or about 52 miles a day, in his journey through 11 states.	2
Most of the world's penguins live in Antarctica. The map shows Antarctica. Look at the map. Then choose the correct answer to each question. The map shows Earth's southernmost continent, Antartica. A hole in the ozone layer opens above Antartica each year. 1. Which ocean is closest to the Prince Charles Mountains? Atlantic Ocean Indian Ocean Pacific Ocean 2. Which mountains are located near the South Pole? Transantarctic Mountains Atlas Mountains Rocky Mountains 3. The pacific Ocean is nearest which part of Antarctica? West Antarctica East Antarctica Queen Maud Land 4. Which sea is not shown on the map? Weddell Sea Ross Sea Red Sea 5. Which ice shelf is closest to the Weddell Sea? Ronne Ice Shelf Ross Ice Shelf Amery Ice Shelf	2
Animals that are too old to perform in zoos or circuses now have special places to live. They can live in retirement homes. Both Nevada and California have special places for retired animals. The animals have plenty of room to run and play. The animals have pools to swim in and trees to climb. Volunteers take care of the animals. All kinds of animals live in the retirement homes. At one home, an ostrich and a buffalo spend lots of time together!	2
In 1909, explorer Matthew Henson was one of the first people to reach the North Pole on foot. Henson, an African American, was honored by the National Geographic Society last fall. The society gave Henson's family the Hubbard Medal, which is the society's highest honor. Henson was an expert sled dog handler. He also learned to speak Inuit, the language spoken by people living near the North Pole.	2
On New Year's Eve, five sailboats took off on a high-speed race around the world. A sixth boat joined in the adventure, called The Race, on New Year's Day. The Race began in Spain, a country in western Europe. The teams on boats will try to sail around South America, Australia, and Africa. The finish line is in France, a country northeast of Spain. The teams hope to finish The Race in 65 days or less. They want to beat the world record, which is 71 days. So The Race should end sometime in March.	2
Arthur the aardvark will celebrate his 25th birthday later this month. To readers, Arthur will always be 8 years old. But Marc Brown has been writing and drawing the Arthur books for 25 years. Weekly Reader talked to Marc Brown about his work. Here's what he had to say. Marc Brown (MB): Telling bedtime stories to my son was one of my favorite things to do. So I decided to write and draw kids' books. MB: I try to make the stories fun to read. But I also write about things that are important to kids. MB: Read, read, read! That's a great way to learn how to put words together. And keep a journal.	2
Scientists studied how penguins move. Because they have short legs and big feet, penguins would get worn out quickly if they walked. When they waddle, penguins rock back and forth. The motion moves them forward easily. The scientists say that waddling could help some people who have trouble walking. Scientists may design new walking devices that move as penguins do.	2
What do birds and people have in common? Dreaming, scientists say. People often dream of events that happened during the day. Scientists say birds dream about singing. Scientists attached a special device to the head of a bird called the zebra finch. Scientists watched how the bird's brain acted while it was singing. Then they watched how the bird's brain behaved while it slept. The bird's brain acted the same way!	2
"Deitte (DEE-et) Curry's dog was having trouble breathing. Doctors said the 12-year-old dog was sick. The dog had a weak heart and needed an operation. Doctors put a pacemaker in the dog's heart. A pacemaker is a small device that helps the heart beat evenly. The dog's pacemaker came from a woman who had died. She wanted her pacemaker to help an animal. A pacemaker cannot be used again in a person, but a pacemaker can be used again in an animal. The dog is healthy now that it has the pacemaker. ""He's as good as new,"" Deitte said. ""He's a puppy all over again!"""	2
Many of the butterflies are from warm rain forests in places like Africa and Asia. So the temperature in the butterfly room is kept at 80 degrees Fahrenheit. Powerful lamps shine down from the ceiling like the sun shines in a rain forest. Visitors to the museum can walk along a pathway through the special room. The butterflies often land on the visitors. People get a close-up look at the butterflies.	2

"Texas Governor George W. Bush or Vice President Al Gore will probably be our next president. The president will do things about education. Weekly Reader talked to the candidates about education. Here's what they had to say: Texas Governor George W. Bush, Republican: ""I hope every child becomes a good reader. I want to make America's schools the best in the world--places where you can learn and soar as high as your dreams will take you."" Vice President Al Gore, Democrat: ""We must [keep our promise] to provide all our children with a high-quality education. I will fight to make sure each and every child receives the quality education they deserve."""	2
People have been celebrating Earth Day since 1970. Earth Day was started by a man named Gaylord Nelson. Nelson was a United States senator from Wisconsin. He was worried about the damage being done to the planet. To celebrate Earth Day, people get together once a year to think about ways to protect Earth. But many people think that every day should be Earth Day. They say people should always work to to stop pollution and clean up the land and water. Cans, bottles, and newspapers can be recycled. That means these objects are put through a special process so they can be used again. Start a can recycling program at your school. Use the money you earn from returning the cans to buy new playground equipment or to have an Earth Day party. Paper is made from trees. You can save a tree by not wasting paper. Use both sides. Celebrate National Arbor Day on April 27 by planting a tree. This holiday encourages people to plant and care for trees. You can easily conserve, or save, water. Turn the faucet off while brushing your teeth and washing your face. Save electricity by turning off the lights when you leave a room. Do not leave a radio or TV on if you aren't using it.	2
The H.L. Hunley in the lifting sling. In 1864, the H. L. Hunley became the first submarine to sink an enemy ship. On its way back to shore, the sub disappeared. In 1995, a team of divers found the Hunley in the water off the coast of South Carolina. The sub was filled with 65,000 pounds of sand and water. In August, divers put 32 thick straps around the sub. The straps were attached to a steel frame that surrounded the sub. A huge crane lifted the frame and the sub from the water in only three minutes. Now scientists will clean and study the sub. Scientists hope to solve the mystery of the sub's disappearance.	2
The United States government recently said it will clean up the Everglades. The Everglades are wetlands in southern Florida. A wetland is an area of wet and spongy soil. Both pollution and construction have hurt the Everglades. A new law will now clean up and protect the Everglades. Over the next 36 years, the government will spend $8 billion to clean up pollution in the Everglades. • The Everglades take up about 2,344 square miles. That's about the size of Delaware.	2
Some experts say that computers can harm kids. They say kids can hurt their bodies while using computers. Some experts say kids can hurt their bodies if they use computers too much. For example, staring at a computer screen for a long time can hurt a kid's eyes. Many kids do not sit up straight while using a computer. Some kids do not have the proper desk and chair. That means kids have to stretch their arms and wrists to reach the computer's mouse and keyboard. Kids can hurt their wrists while stretching to use a computer. Experts also worry that kids are not getting enough exercise because of computers. Some kids would rather use a computer than play a sport or a game. Kids need exercise to stay healthy. Imagine a classroom filled with computers and students--but no teacher. That's what some experts think school will be like in 2010. They say that kids will eventually take all their classes Online. That means students will use computers and the Internet to connect with teachers and kids from all over the world. For example, a teacher in Africa might teach you a lesson about elephants! Technology experts say that kids' backpacks will be filled with the latest technology. Instead of notebooks and pencils, you might carry a laptop computer and an e-book reader!	2
Ann Bancroft and Liv Arnesen are trying to become the first women to ski across Antarctica. They plan to ski 4,200 miles in 100 days. That is the longest distance ever skied by women. The women began their journey in November. That is spring in Antarctica. But the average temperature is 39 degrees below zero! Freezing winds blow at 100 miles per hour. The wind is helping Arnesen and Bancroft. They attach themselves and the sleds that carry their supplies to sails, so the wind helps them ski faster. They hope to finish their trip later this month.	2
About 47 million American kids went back to school in September. Some live in cities that do not have big enough schools for all the kids. Some of those cities do not have space or money to build new schools. That is why some cities are turning empty shopping malls into schools. Stores become classrooms, and restaurants become lunchrooms. Making a mall into a school is faster and costs less than building a new school.	2
Hundreds of cows are visiting U.S. cities. But they are not real cows. The cows are statues dressed in costumes. Some look like clowns. Some wear cowboy boots! These crazy cow statues are starring in an art show called Cow Parade 2000. Artists and schoolchildren decorate the life-size cow statues. The cows will stand on sidewalks and in city parks until October. Then the cows will be sold, and the money will be given to local charities.	2
Scientists discovered the first fossil of a dinosaur heart last April. A fossil is what is left of a plant or an animal that lived long ago. The dinosaur was named Thescelosaurus (THES-uh-loh-SAWR-us). The dinosaur's heart has four chambers, or parts. A human heart also has four chambers. Scientists say the dinosaur heart may have worked a lot like the human heart. Before the discovery, scientists thought that dinosaur hearts had only three chambers. A four-chambered heart probably helped Thescelosaurus move quickly. Being able to move fast helped it get away from larger dinosaurs.	2
The table shows data, or information, about different kinds of dinosaurs. Use the data to answer the questions. Choose your answer. 1. How long was Brachiosaurus? 75 to 85 Feet 30 to 40 Feet 22 to 28 Feet 2. Which dinosaur weighed 10,000 to 12,000 pounds? Brachiosaurus Plateosaurus Iguanodon 3. How many of the dinosaurs listed lived in Asia? One Three Four 4. Which dinosaur weighed the least? Iguanodon Triceratops Plateosaurus 5. Which continent did Triceratops live on? North America Europe Antarctica 6. The smallest Plateosaurus was how many feet shorter than Triceratops? 4 Feet 7 Feet 12 Feet	2
A few of the Sacagawea (sa-kuh-juh-WEE-uh) dollar coins have been misprinted. One side of the new gold-colored coin shows the face of George Washington. That is usually found on a quarter. The other side shows the back of a Sacagawea dollar coin. So far, only four misprinted coins have been reported. Coin collectors call these very rare coins mules. Three of the four mules have been sold for between $29,000 and $41,000!	2
In late January, a powerful earthquake hit India, a country in Asia. An earthquake is a strong, shaking movement of the ground. Scientists say the earthquake was the strongest to strike India in 50 years. The quake caused houses and buildings to fall down. Thousands of people were killed, and many were injured. Rescue workers from countries all over the world are caring for the survivors. They are helping rebuild businesses and homes.	2
Imagine sending out 25 e-mails and getting 115,000 e-mails back. That's what happened to John Street and his fourth-grade class in Newcastle, Nebraska. The students wanted to learn about the countries of the world. So they sent 25 e-mails to Street's friends. People who got the e-mails were asked to forward, or send along, the e-mails to someone else. The students asked everyone to send them an e-mail that told their location. They pinpointed each location on a world map. E-mails came from every continent and dozens of countries. Many more people mailed letters to the students. Street said he made one mistake with the project. He didn't include an end date. Nearly a year later, the e-mails show no signs of stopping.	2
The MacPherson family left their home in Washington, D.C., last July. They will travel around the world for one year. The MacPhersons will visit South America, Africa, Asia, and Australia. The MacPhersons went on the trip because they want to see the world together. The MacPherson kids will not go to school for a year. But they did bring school books. Their parents think they will learn a lot from traveling the world.	2
Fixing the flag is a big job. The flag is 42 feet long and 30 feet wide! Workers lie on their stomachs on a platform above the flag. The workers have removed material that covered the back of the flag. The workers had to cut 1.7 million stitches! Next, the flag's holes will be patched. The project will be finished in 2002.	2
On September 15, a runner will carry a torch into the Olympic stadium in Sydney, Australia. When the runner arrives, the 2000 Summer Olympic Games can begin! The torch traveled for 128 days from Greece, a country in Europe. It was carried by more than 13,000 people. The torch was carried on an airplane, in a helicopter, and on a camel's back. It was even carried by a diver underwater! The torch is special because the smoke from the torch's flame does not pollute the air. Empty fuel cans and leftover fuel will be used again. The torch also has a built-in safety system. If the torch is turned upside down or left lying on the ground, the flame goes out. The torch will light the Olympic flame in Sydney. The flame will burn until the Games are finished on October 1. More than 100 countries will send their best athletes to compete in the Olympics. The United States will send at least 200 athletes to the Games. The top three finishers in each event win a medal. First-place finishers win a gold medal, second-place finishers win a silver medal, and third-place finishers win a bronze medal. The first Olympics took place long ago in Greece. The Olympics helped keep peace among different groups of people.	2
A group of sandhill cranes made their first flight last fall by learning to follow the leader. But their leader was not another crane. The birds followed a scientist who flew a small airplane. Eleven sandhill cranes flew from Wisconsin to Florida last fall. The birds followed a scientist flying a small airplane on the 39-day trip. Each fall, cranes travel from cold areas, like Wisconsin, to warm areas, like Florida. Baby cranes learn from their parents how to make the trip. But these cranes learned to follow scientists. When the sandhill cranes hatched, the first thing they saw was a group of scientists dressed to look like adult cranes. The scientists fed the chicks. The chicks thought the scientists were their mothers. Then the scientists trained the young birds to follow an airplane. The scientists played a tape of the noise that planes make. They also played sounds adult sandhill cranes make. So the cranes learned to trust and follow people in planes. By flying to Florida, 11 sandhill cranes were helping their cousins, the whooping cranes. Many sandhill cranes live in the United States. But few whooping cranes live here anymore. Only one group of whooping cranes knows how to migrate, or travel, from the North to the South. Scientists hope to teach other whooping cranes to migrate. More cranes may survive if they can learn to travel back and forth.	2
Football is not just for men and boys anymore. The Women's Professional Football League (WPFL) had its first game in October. Right now, the WPFL has 14 teams. Each team will play ten games this season. Past women's football leagues in the United States have failed. But there are strong women's football teams in Australia, Germany, and Japan. They play by the same rules the U.S. teams follow.	2
This year's Summer Olympics will be in Australia. The last Summer Olympic Games were held in the United States in 1996. The table shows the number of gold medals top four countries won. Study the table. 1. How many gold medals did Russia win? 2. Which country won 20 gold medals? 3. Which country won the most gold medals? 4. How many gold medals did China win?	2
Many states are using goats to eat plants on mountains and in fields close to people's houses. By eating plants in those areas, the goats leave a clear patch of land. That way, if a fire starts in the forest, it will not be able to spread to where people live.	2
Scientists fear that many animals will be endangered if there are too few horseshoe crabs. Many animals eat horseshoe crabs. To help the horseshoe crab, the government has made a rule saying how many crabs each state can catch. States must not catch more than that number. Scientists say the rule may mean there will be more horseshoe crabs soon.	2
When he was a kid, George W. Bush dreamed of becoming a baseball player. Now that he is grown up, Bush's dream is to be the next United States president. George W. Bush grew up in Midland, Texas. His childhood friends remember him as a class clown. Since 1995, Bush has been the governor of Texas. Now Bush is running for president. He has chosen Richard Cheney to run for vice president. Together, Bush and Cheney want to lead our country. On Election Day, voters will decide whether they will get the job. Weekly Reader asked George W. Bush some questions about himself. Here's what he had to say. George W. Bush: Because I will do what I have promised to do. I [will] bring people together to achieve common goals. GWB: Set high goals and work hard to [reach] them. You can be anything you want to be. Full Name: George Walker Bush Birthday: July 6, 1946 Place of Birth: New Haven, Connecticut Family: Married to Laura. Twin daughters Barbara and Jenna are 18. Pets: Three cats, named Cowboy, Willie, and Ernie. A dog named Spot.	2
"Do you wear headgear when you play soccer? Some parents think you should. That is because many kids use their heads to hit soccer balls. This is called ""heading."" Some doctors say that heading can hurt your brain. A group of parents has made special helmets and headbands to protect kids' heads.

Many people visit Hawaii each year. They admire the coral reefs that surround the islands. But those beautiful reefs have been damaged by people and ships. Recently the United States government made a law to protect the reefs around Hawaii. A coral reef is a large strip of hard sea animal skeletons that is close to the ocean's surface. More than half of the United States' coral reefs are located in the waters around Hawaii. Coral reefs provide homes for sea animals. Reefs also protect coastlines from dangerous, pounding waves. When waves pass over reefs, they slow down and get smaller. Hawaii's reefs are being hurt. People have polluted the water around the reefs and have taken too many fish. Before he left office, President Bill Clinton created the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands Coral Reef Reserve. A reserve is an area protected by the government. This reserve is underwater and covers 84 million acres. That is almost as big as the states of Florida and Georgia combined. Special rules make sure the reef reserve will be protected. People are not allowed to remove coral from the reefs. The number of fish taken from the reserve area cannot go up. Hawaii's reefs are now protected from further damage. A coral reef is built by tiny sea creatures called coral polyps Coral polyps have hard outer skeletons that protect them. When the polyps die, their skeletons stay. After a long time, the coral skeletons build up, forming a reef.	2
Naoko Takahashi buzzed past other runners in the Olympic marathon last year. (A marathon is a 26-mile footrace.) The runner says that hornets helped her win the gold medal for Japan, a country in Asia. The insects didn't lend Naoko their wings, however. Before and during the race, Takahashi drank the stomach juice of giant hornets! Japanese scientists say that the drink helps people move faster and prevents muscles from tiring. A Japanese company plans to make a sports drink out of hornet juice soon.	2

"Giant panda Hua Mei celebrated her first birthday in August. Hua Mei (wah may) lives in the San Diego Zoo in California. The zoo gave Hua Mei a birthday party. Hua Mei had a cake made of bamboo. Bamboo is a plant and is the giant panda's favorite food. Hua Mei's birthday is special because there are very few giant pandas in the world. Hua Mei's name means ""China USA."""	2
A program called Ice Hockey in Harlem teachers kids how to play hockey. They learn the rules of the game and about hockey equipment. Then, one night per week, kids practice hockey at a local skating rink. To play hockey, the kids have to go to tutoring sessions. The sessions use hockey information as learning tools. For example, the kids practice math skills by comparing hockey teams' scores. If the kids keep their grades up, they can play on hockey teams. Some travel across the country playing other teams.	2
"Last November, doctors operated on a clouded leopard named Joe. Joe had not been eating and had trouble walking. A disease was causing fluid to press on Joe's brain. This disease can also happen to cats, dogs, and humans. A two-hour operation saved Joe's life. Joe is special because he is an endangered species. He is one of only a few hundred clouded leopards in the world. Joe lives in Texas at the Fort Worth Zoo. He is often taken out of the zoo to visit people at schools and churches. A veterinarian, or animal doctor, at the zoo said Joe is ""part of the family."""	2

Sahara Sunday Spain is like a lot of 9-year-olds. She enjoys painting pictures, singing songs, and writing poetry. But unlike most kids her age, Sahara is a published poet. In February, she published her first book of poems. Sahara started writing poems when she was 5 years old. Now some of the 400 poems she has written are in a book. The book is called If There Would Be No Light.	2
What do takeout pizza and toys have in common? Justin Lewis and Matthew Balick invented toys they call Flip-Its out of pizza savers. A pizza saver is the white piece of plastic used to keep cheese off the takeout box. Balick and Lewis, both from Illinois, found that if they pressed down on a pizza saver, it went flying. So they created 24 colorful, three-legged Flip-Itz characters.	2
Students from across the country are raising money to help build the National World War II Memorial. The memorial will honor the men and women who served in World War II (1939-1945). It will be located in Washington, D.C. The memorial is expected to cost $100 million. So far, kids from 1,200 schools have raised more than $600,000.

If George W. Bush wins the presidential election, it will be the second time in U.S. history that a father and son have been president. George H. W. Bush, George W.'s father, was our 41st president. He served from 1989 to 1993. Seven years later, George W. Bush is battling Vice President Al Gore to become the 43rd president. John Adams was the second president of the United States. He was the president from 1797 to 1801. John Quincy Adams, his son, became our sixth president 24 years later.	2
In a national park in Ghana, a country in Africa, scientists watched a baby elephant. It had become separated from its family and stood quietly. But soon the scientists saw the baby elephant's family surround it. How did the family find the baby elephant? Scientists say that the baby was making very low rumbling sounds that humans cannot hear. Scientists knew this because they had placed special recording devices in the forest. The devices recorded the rumbles that the baby elephant was making. Scientists said that the rumbles were actually calls for help. Scientists also recorded two elephants greeting each other by calling back and forth. Another time, a family of elephants made rumbles to keep the group together as they traveled. Scientists hope to figure out what some other elephant sounds mean. That will help them learn more about elephants and keep track of them in the forest. Move over Backstreet Boys, something bigger is now on music store shelves. The Thai Elephant Orchestra released its first album last December. The orchestra is made up of six Asian elephants from the Thai Elephant Conservation Center. The center is located in Lampang, Thailand. Thailand is a country in Southeast Asia. The elephants play many instruments, including drums and a xylophone. The money raised from album sales will be used to care for baby elephants. Workers will buy milk to feed elephants that have lost their mothers.	2
This year, Memorial Day will be celebrated on May 28. On this holiday, we honor the American men and women who have served in past wars. A special animal cemetery in New York honors dogs that helped soldiers in wars. Dogs helped locate people injured in wars. When specially trained dogs brought a soldier's helmet to rescue workers, they knew the soldier needed help. Dogs also carried messages and supplies during wars. The Hartsdale Pet Cemetery in Hartsdale, New York, built a memorial to war dogs in 1923. Since then, the cemetery has held a special ceremony each Memorial Day to honor the dogs.	2

Many African penguins live on Robben Island. A ship carrying oil sank near the island. The oil spilled into the water and covered thousands of penguins. Oil can make penguins sick, so wildlife workers tried to help them. In July, wildlife workers rescued African penguins from Robben Island. Robben Island is in the Atlantic Ocean near South Africa. Workers took 14,500 oily penguins to a wildlife center. Each penguin was carefully washed. It took two people about an hour to clean the oil from each of the birds! Workers took the cleaned penguins to the east coast of South Africa. The penguins were set free in the ocean and swam back to Robben Island. While the penguins were swimming home, workers had time to clean up the spilled oil. Workers put a special device on a few penguins. The device sent information to a computer. The computer showed exactly where each penguin was on its 560-mile swim home. Did you know that there are 17 kinds of penguins? Here are just a few:	2
A company called Boundless Playgrounds is making special playgrounds. The equipment is different from other playgrounds. These special places are for all kids. Kids who use wheelchairs or walkers can play on the equipment easily. The playground has special kinds of swings. Some swings have high backs and armrests. Other swings look like the one in the photo. These swings can hold lots of kids safely. Ramps connect different parts of the equipment. The playground is fun for all kids.	2
For years, people have thought of Pluto as the smallest planet in our solar system. Now, some scientists say that Pluto is actually an asteroid. An asteroid is a rocky object that moves in the solar system. Did you know that it would take 88,000 tons of yarn to stretch from Earth to an asteroid called Braille? That's more than enough yarn to make sweaters for every person in the United States! You can learn more cool facts at the Space Place, a great Web site made just for kids! So take off to the Space Place at spaceplace.jpl.nasa.gov/spacepl.htm	2
Both the United States and Russia are worried about polar bears. Russia is a large country in Europe and Asia. Many polar bears are hunted each year. Some people eat polar bear meat. Others sell polar bear fur to be used for rugs. The United States and Russia fear that the number of polar bears is dropping too quickly. Recently, both countries agreed to protect polar bears. People in each country can hunt only a small number of polar bears each year. They can no longer hunt female bears or cubs, which are young bears.	2
"Hi! My Name is Pam Pollster. This is my pet parakeet, Polly. We live in Polling Place. Polly is a smart bird. In fact, she's so smart, she can count very high numbers. This is good, because I need Polly's help--and yours--with a problem. The problem is that Polling Place needs a new motto. The one we have now is kind of lame. Want to hear it? ""Polling Place. Live Here. It's Nice."" I told you it was lame. That's why we need a new motto. The town council came up with three choices. Now, it's up to Polly and me to find out which choice people like best. How are Polly and I going to find out everyone's opinion? It won't be easy. A few thousand people live in Polling Place. We sure don't have the time to go to every person's house to find out which motto he or she likes. (Besides, my bike has a flat tire and my in-line skates don't fit.) So what should we do? Well, Polly came up with a great idea. We can poll the people of Polling Place! (Told you she was smart.) A poll is a way of asking a small part of a large group of people what they think. Then, using math, you can figure out what the larger group is thinking. Polls are used all the time. In fact, they are really important during elections. (You know, the big thing that's on the news all the time?) Polls are also used to help the government, businesses, and organizations make decisions or plans. So, what is the first step for our motto poll of Polling Place? Turn the page to find out! Believe it or not, polling has been around for a long time in the United States. One of the first political polls was done in 1824! In those days, newspapers asked readers to write in saying the person they liked for president. One newspaper did a poll that said Andrew Jackson would be president. But Jackson didn't get enough votes to win. John Quincy Adams won that election and became our seventh president. Why was the newspaper wrong? The biggest problem was that only the readers of that one newspaper took part in the poll. It did not show what all people in the U.S. felt. By the 1960s, polling became more scientific. Such a scientific poll was used by John F. Kennedy during the 1960 presidential election. The poll, done by Louis Harris, figured out what issues people were worried about. For a poll to be scientific, three things must happen. Get a sample. The people who run a poll need to get a sample of people. A sample is a small part of a larger group of people. A sample for a poll must include ALL types of people, like boys and girls, young and old. Also, no one can know who is going to get picked for a poll's sample. And no one can volunteer to take part in a poll. Figure it out. Finally, experts, sometimes with the help of math, study the data, or people's answers. Then they put the data into charts so that it is easier for everyone to understand. So how did Polly and I poll the people of Polling Place? Here's how we did it. Step 1. The first step was to figure out the subject of the poll. That was easy! We wrote down the following on a piece of paper: Step 2. The tough part of polling is figuring out how to ask people our questions and get their answers. One way is to send people out to ask our questions. Another is to call people on the telephone. The Internet is also another way of polling. Polly and I decided to go out and ask a sample of all kinds of people. Step 3. We now have our data from the people of Polling Place! Next we will put it together into a chart. So what's the result? Which motto did the people of Polling Place like best?"	2
"Popocatépetl means ""smoking mountain"" in a language once spoken in Mexico. It is also the name of a Mexican volcano, which people have nicknamed ""Popo."" Mexico is a country just south of the United States. Inside Popo and below Earth's surface, temperatures were about 2,000 degrees Fahrenheit before Popo popped. Scientists from Mexico and the United States used special tools to keep track of what was happening inside Popo. One tool detected that magma, or melted rock, was rising inside the volcano. During eruptions, magma can spill out of openings in volcanoes. The hot, flowing magma is called lava when it is outside the volcano. When Popo erupted, only heat, gas, and ashes burst out. After the eruption, the residents were able to return to their homes. But they are watching for future eruptions. Lava and ash from volcanoes can harm people. What else might these substances harm?"	2
Some students from Missouri are testing seeds. The students had sent one batch of seeds on Atlantis. They kept a second batch of seeds on Earth. The astronauts on Atlantis brought their seeds back to Earth on September 20. The students planted the seeds that had been in space. The students also planted the seeds they had kept on Earth. When the seeds grow into plants, the students will compare them. They want to find out whether being in space changed the seeds. Other objects were also carried into space. Students sent hair, bread, hamburger, toothpaste, and even bubble gum! The students want to see if being in space affected the objects. The main mission of the space shuttle was to carry supplies to the International Space Station (ISS). Many countries are building the station. The ISS is being built about 250 miles above Earth. Scientists plan to start living and working in the space station before December. If all goes well, the ISS will be finished in 2006.	2
"People in the United States will celebrate Martin Luther King Jr. Day on January 15. That day is King's birthday. He will be honored for the important work he did. Soon, a monument will be built in Washington, D.C., to honor King. The memorial will sit on the shore of the Potomac River in Washington, D.C. It will cover an area of land about the size of three football fields. Visitors will be able to walk along a path lined with large stone panels. Each panel will show words from King's important speeches. There will also be a 20-foot-high stone statue of King. Workers will probably begin building the memorial this year. They plan to finish the memorial in 2003. On August 28, 1963, King gave an important speech in Washington, D.C., to more than 200,000 people. King asked that all people be treated equally, or the same. That speech is often called the ""I Have a Dream"" speech. For many years, African Americans were not treated equally in the United States. King worked hard to solve that problem. He told people to work out their problems by talking, not fighting."	2
California Sea Lions live along the west coast of North America. The map shows the west coast of the U.S. Tourists like to visit the busy piers of San Francisco, California. (A pier is a platform built over water.) People like to look at boats tied up at the piers. They also enjoy watching sea lions that have made a home at one of San Francisco's piers. San Francisco's Pier 39 is packed with sea lions. The sea lions sleep in the sun, bark loudly, and eat fish. (They don't always smell that great, however!) Animal experts are not sure why sea lions first came to Pier 39. But the number of sea lions has grown each year since an earthquake hit San Francisco in 1989. Before the earthquake, only about 30 sea lions camped out at Pier 39. Now, the number of sea lions can be as high as 600! Experts say the earthquake might have caused herring, a type of fish, to swim closer to San Francisco than before. Herring is a favorite food of sea lions, so they might have followed those fish to shore. Sea lions might also like the pier because they have plenty of room to spread out. The Marine Mammal Center, an organization that cares for sea animals, asked the city to protect the sea lions. Now the sea lions cannot be moved from the pier. Storm drains in Oxnard, California, usually don't bark. But they do if there is a sea lion stuck inside! Two kids called the police when they heard barking and saw a sea lion inside a storm drain. (A storm drain is a large pipe that drains rainwater into a lake or ocean.) A rescue team used a large fishing net to free the sea lion. The team spent five hours bringing the 350-pound sea lion out through a manhole. Rescue workers took the sea lion back to the Pacific Ocean in a truck. They say the sea lion was probably swimming in a local harbor when it entered the drain.	2
Schools across the country are trying to protect kids from getting hurt by heavy backpacks. Researchers say heavy backpacks can hurt kids' backs and cause kids to fall down. Some schools are giving students two sets of textbooks. Students keep one set in school, and they leave the other set at home. That way, kids don't have to carry books back and forth every day. Experts say that a kid who weighs 60 pounds should carry a backpack that weighs 9 pounds or less. If a kid weighs 70 pounds, his or her pack should weigh no more than 12 pounds.	2
The land on Devon Island is a lot like the land on Mars. Scientists wanted to find out what life on Mars might be like. Scientists lived on Devon Island to study it. Scientists hope that someday people will be able to visit Mars. To find out what life on Mars might be like, scientists went to an island right here on Earth. Devon Island is about 900 miles from the North Pole. Scientists say Mars might look a lot like Devon Island. Both Devon Island and Mars have rocky hills and valleys. Devon Island is cold and so is Mars. Scientists used the cold weather on Devon Island to test a spacesuit they might wear on Mars. A visit to Mars might not happen for many years. But by studying Devon Island, scientists will be ready for the trip.	2
Scientists want to make a list of every kind of animal in the park. They want to protect the living things in the park. Scientists say that knowing what animals live in the park will make protecting them easier.	2
"Sharks do not like the taste of people. That's what Dr. Peter Klimley says. Klimley is a scientist who studies sharks. He says sharks would rather eat seals and sea lions than people. Seals and sea lions have a thick layer of fat on them. Eating that fat gives sharks energy. Klimley says people's bodies do not have enough fat to fill up a shark. Klimley thinks that sharks should be afraid of people. Each year, people kill about 65 million sharks. Some people like to eat shark meat. And some sharks die because they live in water that is polluted. Klimley says that at least seven kinds of sharks are endangered. The number of those sharks has dropped in the past ten years. Klimley hopes that people will help protect sharks. Weekly Reader talked to Dr. Peter Klimley about his work. Here's what he had to say. Peter Klimley (PK): I wanted to study how sharks behave. I wanted to get into their world and learn everything about them. PK: No. Many kinds of sharks are not dangerous. I think sharks bite people by mistake. PK: The hammerhead shark. I have studied the hammerhead for most of my life. I am often called ""Dr. Hammerhead""!"	2

You probably know that cigarette smoking makes people sick. But did you know that smoking hurts the environment? Sometimes people drop cigarette butts on the ground. Many beaches in the United States are littered with cigarette butts. When beach cleanups are held, cigarette butts are picked up more often than any other kind of trash. Cigarette butts can be dangerous. Cigarettes have hundreds of poisons in them. Scientists worry that the poisons could pollute the ocean water. Cigarette butts can also harm animals. Seabirds will try to eat cigarette butts. The birds think the butts are food. The butts get stuck in the birds' stomachs and make them sick. On November 16, kids across the United States will scream their lungs out. That's when the Great American SmokeScream will happen. The kids will tell people not to smoke. You need healthy lungs to breathe and to scream loudly. Keep your lungs healthy by not smoking. Use your healthy lungs to tell other people not to smoke.	2
Did you know that the sun can power a car? Students from Canada set a world record last summer with a car powered by the sun. The students drove 4,350 miles in the solar-powered car. It is the longest distance a solar car has ever traveled. Because the car uses the sun for power, it does not pollute the air. Special cells are on top of the car. The cells collect sunlight and turn it into electricity. The electricity powers the car's motor. Each day, the car used the same amount of electricity needed to run a toaster. The team hopes that someday more people will drive solar cars.	2
Scientists have never seen a living giant squid. They want to learn more about this huge animal that lives deep in the ocean. Scientists believe giant squids live about a mile down in the ocean. They live in the coldest, darkest part of the ocean. Recently, scientists traveled in submarines to look for the giant squid. Even with the light from the submarine, they could not see the huge giant squid. The sperm whale is the giant squid's only enemy. Scientists attached video cameras to the heads of some sperm whales with suction cups. They hoped the cameras would take pictures of giant squids swimming. The cameras filmed other types of squids, but not the giant squid. For now, the giant squid remains a mystery. Debra Ingrao works at Mote Marine Laboratory in Florida. Last year, Debra flew to New Zealand to bring back a dead giant squid to study. She talked to Weekly Reader about her work. DI: I enjoy studying sea animals in their natural habitats. [A habitat is the place where an animal lives.] DI: Its large size is scary! But giant squids don't live where people swim.	2

Colorado Alaska Mississippi 6. How much shorter is New Hampshire's state tree than Wisconsin's state tree? 20 Feet 22 Feet 30 Feet	2
The San Francisco Giants baseball team has several four-legged helpers. These furry friends help the team by fetching baseballs. Six Portuguese (POR-chuh-geez) water dogs joined the Giants baseball team last summer. The dog team is known as B.A.R.K. That stands for Baseball Aquatic Retrieval Korps. B.A.R.K. 's job is to bring back home-run balls that go out of the ballpark. But this is not as easy as it sounds. The Giant's ballpark is right next to San Francisco Bay in California. Home-run balls hit to right field usually go into the bay. The B.A.R.K. team rides around the bay in a motorboat. When a ball lands in the bay, a B.A.R.K. dog dives into the water and brings back the ball. The Giants founded the dog team with help from Pets In Need, a local animal shelter. During baseball games, workers from Pets In Need are at the ballpark trying to find homes for the shelter's animals. Pets In Need also sells the home-run balls to fans and uses the money to help its animals. Specially trained dogs work for the U.S. government. They can sniff out illegal drugs in suitcases. An Air Force base in Delaware became home to too many birds. The birds were getting in the way of the base's airplanes, so dogs were hired to shoo the birds away.	2
"In 1991, the frozen body of a man who lived 5,000 years ago was found in the Ötztal (oet-sahl) alps. Those are mountains on the continent of europe. Scientists named the ""iceman"" Ötzi (oet-see). Recently, scientists thawed Ötzi so they could study his body. Ötzi is the world's oldest frozen mummy. Scientists want to learn more about Ötzi. So they thawed and examined his body. Scientists took samples of Ötzi's bones and skin. The samples might help scientists figure out more about Ötzi's life. Samples from Ötzi's stomach and teeth may tell scientists what kind of food he ate. Some foods grew only in certain areas. Knowing about Ötzi's diet will help scientists figure out where he lived. Ötzi lived thousands of years ago. Knowing about Ötzi's life will tell scientists more about life on Earth long ago. Some tools and objects that were found near Ötzi. Ötzi's ax helped scientists figure out how long he had been frozen. The blade on his ax was made of a reddish brown metal called copper. Copper was used in tools thousands of years ago. Scientists figured out that Ötzi had been frozen for about 5,300 years!"	2
The Bowler family of England took a trip back in time last year. The Bowlers moved into a house that did not have electricity or a telephone. The Bowlers lived for three months as a family would live in the year 1900. The family even had to wear clothes from the year 1900. The clothes were not comfortable. The girls wore long dresses that they often tripped on. For fun, the Bowlers played card games. They also built a puppet theater and put on puppet shows. TV cameras took pictures while the Bowlers lived in the old house. Those pictures were made into a TV program called The 1900 House.	2
Scientists find one T. rex (Tyrannosaurus rex) fossil about every ten years. The T. rex was probably the fiercest dinosaur that lived on Earth. Scientists say that a recent dino discovery in Montana is unusual. Five T. rex fossils have never been found in one place before. One of the five T. rex fossils may be the largest ever found. Scientists will know more after they study the fossils closely. Some of the fossils are still stuck inside tons of rock. Scientists have removed parts of four of the skeletons. They will free the rest of the fossils next summer when the weather is better in Montana. Because of the discovery, scientists think the T. rex dinosaur might have been more common than they had thought. That means scientists will probably find many more T. rex fossils in the future. A dinosaur named Sue is currently the most famous Tyrannosaurus rex. Sue's bones are on display at the Field Museum in Chicago, Illinois. The T. rex skeleton was named after Sue Hendrickson, who found it in South Dakota in 1990. Sue is the largest and most complete T. rex fossil ever found.	2

The world's oldest written song was recently found on the wall of a tomb. A tomb is a special building for the dead. The 4,300-year-old tomb is located in Egypt, a country in Africa. The song was written in an old form of writing that uses pictures instead of letters and words. Pictures of people playing musical instruments are also on the wall. The tomb belonged to a judge named Inti. Some scientists say the writing is a love song. Scientists wonder whether Inti wrote the song for his wife.	2
Imagine having to quit school to help your family earn money. Or think about what it might be like to be in a class with 49 other students and only one teacher. Kids in some countries must deal with problems like those. But a special worldwide organization is trying to help them. UNICEF helps children around the world. One way it helps is by providing schools and supplies. Three of the countries where UNICEF helps with education are Colombia, in South America, Rwanda (ruh-WAHN-duh), in Africa, and Thailand (TIGH-land), in Southeast Asia. Those countries are probably far from where you live. Have you ever wondered what it might be like to go to school in another country? In Colombia, the government requires kids to go to school for at least five years. Some people are poor and must work hard to survive. Some children must quit school to help their parents earn money. With UNICEF's help, Colombia's government is creating a special school for those children. The students learn at their own pace and attend when they can. They have a small library and a garden where they grow vegetables. One or two teachers must teach all the students, from grades 1 through 5. Students of the same age work together in small groups, helping one another learn. Children in Rwanda must go to school from ages 7 to 15. But there is not enough space in some schools in Rwanda to fit all the students. Some students cannot afford to buy the uniforms and notebooks they must have to go to school. To help solve those problems, UNICEF has created a special program called Schools-in-a-Box. Each box contains school supplies, workbooks, and learning games. When teachers use the Schools-in-a-Box, kids can be taught wherever they are. Children in Thailand must go to school for six years. Though school is free, some families cannot afford to buy the uniforms children must wear to school. Some classrooms in Thailand have as many as 50 kids and only one teacher! Often, children of all ages are in the same grade. The children must share the few books and school supplies that are in the school. But UNICEF is working to help these people. The organization has built Village Education Centers in parts of Thailand. At night, adults gather there and take classes. During the day, the buildings are schools for children. UNICEF is an organization that works to help children all over the world. UNICEF tries to provide health care, nutritious food, clean water, and an education for all children. The organization raises money and talks to world governments about helping children.	2
Mount Oyama erupted eight times during the summer! The volcano is on Miyake Island in Japan. The volcano covered the tiny island with smoke and ash.

Casey Martin is a professional golfer. But Martin has a disease that makes walking painful for him. So he would like to ride in a golf cart between shots during golf games. Members of the Professional Golf Association (PGA) think it would be unfair to let Martin ride in a cart. They say that part of the competition in a golf match is walking the golf course. Some matches last four days, and players walk about 25 miles. Now the U.S. Supreme Court will decide whether Martin can use a golf cart. The Supreme Court is the most important court in the United States. In January, the justices of the Court listened to what Martin and the PGA had to say about using the golf cart. The Court plans to make a decision by July.	2

Clinton: We should all be proud to be Americans because this truly is a land of opportunity. [No matter what your background is], you can work hard and [reach] your dreams. Clinton: I'll continue to work hard on some of the issues that are very important to me [such as helping poor people and the environment]. I'm sure I'll be very busy, but I also hope to spend more time with my family and friends and to simply relax after what has been eight of the most incredible years of my life.	2
Scooters, skateboards, and in-line skates can be a lot of fun. But without safety gear, kids who use these toys are in danger. Play it safe! In 1999, about 3½ million kids were hurt while playing sports and using outdoor toys. Almost half of those kids got hurt while playing with scooters, skateboards, or in-line skates. The injured kids were probably not wearing safety gear. Without safety gear, playing with some toys can be very dangerous. Pads and guards protect parts of your body that could be hurt if you fall. Most kids know that they should wear a helmet when they ride a bike. But kids should also wear helmets when they play with scooters, skateboards, and in-line skates. Kids can cut the chances of getting hurt in half by wearing protective gear.	2

But taking care of Earth is important all of the time. Turn the page to see how you can be Earth-friendly every day! Each person in the United States makes about 4 pounds of trash per day! So landfills, or places where people dump trash, are starting to get full. People should reduce, or make smaller, the amount of trash they throw away. Paper takes up the largest amount of space in most landfills. Paper does not easily biodegrade, or break down. But paper is easily recycled, or used again, after going through a special process. Some trash in landfills could be used for other things! Instead of throwing trash away, people should find more ways to reuse it, or use trash again. Reuse the top of a pizza box as an easel. Use the bottom part of the box to store your art supplies. Many times people forget to respect, or care for, Earth. One way to show respect for Earth is to use less water, electricity, and gasoline.	2
"The bones in your body are made of a hard material. Bones help you stand up. They protect body parts such as your brain, heart, and lungs. Without bones, people wouldn't be able to move and they would have no shape. A set of bones is called a skeleton. Grown-ups have 206 bones in their skeleton. The smallest bone in the skeleton is in the ear. It is call the stirrup bone. The biggest bone is a leg bone called the femur. People go to the doctors when they break their bones. Because bones are inside the body, doctors need to use X-rays to see them. X-rays make special pictures of bones. The pictures help doctors find where a bone is broken. Once the doctos knows where the break is, he or she can help it heal. The funny bone is not really a bone. It is the nickname for a place at the back of the elbow. When that place is hit, you get a funny feeling. The funny bone is found at the end of the humerus, or upper arm bone. Humerus sounds like the word humorous, which means ""funny"". Every bone in your body has a job to do. Some bones are meant to protect you. The skull helps protect your brain. Other bones like the ribs work to keep the body's shape. The femur helps hold people up when they stand."	2

Summer is almost here! Why do experts say that summer is the most dangerous time of the year for kids? During the summer, most schools are closed. Kids have more time to play outside, ride bikes, and swim. That means kids have more chances to get hurt. Playing outside gives you a chance to breathe fresh air, but it also exposes you to harmful sun rays. Harmful sun rays can cause sunburns. You can get a sunburn even if you are outside for a short amount of time. So when you are in the sun, always wear sunscreen. Use a sunscreen with a sun protection factor (SPF) of 15 or higher, and be sure to rub it evenly into your skin. You should also wear a hat and try to play in the shade. Whether you ride a bike, ride a scooter, or use in-line skates, be wheel safe. The most serious way kids get hurt while on wheels is by hitting their heads. So always wear a helmet when you are playing on wheels. When you ride scooters and use in-line skates, always wear wrist guards, kneepads, and elbow pads.	2

Some whales, like a humpback, eat krill. Krill are tiny animals that look like shrimp. The humpback opens its mouth and takes in water and krill. Grooves in the whale's throat stretch to help it hold a lot of water and food. Then it pushes the water out and eats the krill. All whales, like blue whales, breathe air through blowholes. A blowhole is an opening on top of a whale's head. The blowhole is closed when the whale is under the water. When the whale comes to the top, its blowhole opens. The whale breathes out, making water spray into the air. Then the whale breathes in and goes under the water again. Most whales, like killer whales, breach. A breaching whale jumps up out of the water. Then it comes down and makes a huge splash! No one is sure why whales breach. Some people say that they do it just for fun! Some whales, like a beluga, communicate. Whales communicate to talk to one another. Scientists think that a whale communicates by making sounds from its blowhole and from its mouth. Some whales can communicate with one another over hundreds of miles of ocean water!	2

A porcupine fish is one type of sea creature that lives in the oceans. When the porcupine fish is in danger, it swallows water and swells like a balloon. It then becomes too large and prickly for an enemy to eat. How do other sea creatures protect themselves? Oceans are home to some of the most colorful animals in the world. Each sea creature uses a different skill to survive. Angelfish usually swim in schools to protect themselves. That makes it hard for enemies to harm one fish in a group. Clown fish live in sea anemones (uh-NEH-muh-neez). Those are poisonous ocean plants. Clown fish have a slimy coating on their bodies that protects them from the plantsâ€™ poison. Sea horses use camouflage to hide from enemies. Animals that use camouflage change color or shape to blend in with their surroundings. Mimic octopuses take on the color, shape, and behavior of other, more dangerous animals. The amazing task can be done in just seconds. To stay safe, this mimic octopus pretends to be a starfish. Jellyfish are soft, clear sea creatures. Some jellyfish have long, poisonous arms called tentacles. The tentacles sting enemies that attack. Earth Day is April 22. This day reminds us to care for our planet. Sometimes oil spills onto beaches and into oceans. People help sea birds by scrubbing their feathers clean of the oil. It is important to keep beaches and oceans free of pollution. Pollution can harm animals and humans. Garbage, like plastic rings from soft drink cans, can harm animals. Animals can get trapped in the ringsâ€™ holes.	2

Thatâ€™s as fast as some airplanes can fly. Look inside for answers to some common questions about weather. There is a science behind every kind of weather. Uncover some interesting weather facts. Why do clouds sometimes look as if they are on the ground instead of in the sky? Sometimes clouds form near the ground. That is called fog. Both fog and clouds are made up of tiny drops of water that hang in the air. Here, fog forms over the Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco, California. What is a blizzard? A blizzard is a winter storm with strong winds. The wind blows the snow so that it is hard to see. Most blizzards last at least three hours. How does rain make a rainbow? Rainbows appear when sunlight passes through raindrops in the sky. As the light passes through, it is broken up into seven colors: red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet. Cirrus clouds are white, wispy streaks high in the sky. Inside these clouds is ice. Cumulonimbus clouds are large thunderclouds. Thunderstorms and tornadoes can form in these clouds. Cumulus clouds are large and puffy. They usually form near the ground and rise to the sky. Stratus clouds are thick layers of clouds low in the sky. Light rain or snow can fall from these clouds.	2

"The Olympics are events in which athletes from around the world compete in different sports. This February, the Winter Olympics will be held in Turin, Italy. One of the newest Winter Olympic sports is snowboarding. The Winter Olympics take place every four years. Here are some popular Winter Olympic sports. Snowboarding was added to the Winter Olympics in 1998. It is a lot like skateboarding and skiing. Snowboarders slide down a steep hill on a long, flat board. They do tricks in the air with their snowboards. Bobsledding is a sport in which athletes push a sled down an icy track. Once the sled starts to slide, the riders jump inside. The bobsled can travel up to 90 miles per hour. Thatâ€™s about the speed of a train! Luge (LOOJ) is the French word for ""sled."" Like bobsledding, it is one of the fastest Olympic sports. The sled races down an icy spiral track. It can also reach speeds up to 90 miles per hour. Cross-country skiing is like running or walking on skis. Athletes use wax on the bottom of their skis to glide uphill, downhill, and across flat land smoothly. They can ski almost as fast as a car travels. Ice hockey is a team sport played on an ice rink. Each team has six players on the ice. Players use long, curved sticks to hit a hard rubber disk called a puck into a goal."	2

A grasshopper can jump a distance of more than 20 times the length of its body! That means a 2-inch grasshopper can jump more than 3 feet! These insects take the prize for their athletic abilities. Some are expert runners, swimmers, or fliers. Others can jump very far or even do acrobatics. They can really move! The dragonfly is one of the fastest flying insects. Some dragonflies can reach 35 miles per hour. This insect is also acrobatic. It can fly backward and turn around quickly. It can also hover, or hang, in the air. The record for longest insect flight goes to the monarch butterfly. Each fall, millions of monarch butterflies from North America spread their wings and fly more than 2,000 miles to forests in Mexico. The diving beetle is an expert swimmer. When it is above water, the bubble on its back fills with air. That lets the beetle breathe underwater. As it swims, the bubble refills with oxygen taken from the water. A favorite to win the longjump contest is the flea. This tiny insect (the size of a pinhead) can jump a distance of 150 times the length of its body. When a flea bends its legs, its rubbery knees spring back, and off it goes! The Australian tiger beetle is one of the fastest running insects. This long-legged beetle can reach speeds of 5 ½ miles per hour. The beetle's speed comes in handy when it is chasing other insects to eat.	2

How do bees and other insects fly so well? Scientists in England may have found the answer. Their research is part of a plan to build tiny aircraft. The scientists learned that bees' wings are stiff at the front and flexible (able to bend easily) at the back. That allows the insects to lift off the ground and move in the air. The aircraft would have tiny cameras attached to them. In the future, these machines may be used for keeping an eye on traffic or even for spying.	2

These dormice are getting ready for a long winter sleep. They eat a lot of food. The food helps them survive, or live, through the winter. The dormouse can sleep for six months during the winter. That long sleep is called hibernation (high-ber-NAY-shun). During hibernation, an animalâ€™s body temperature drops, and its heart rate slows. Some animals go into such a deep sleep that they cannot be wakened. Others wake for a short time to look for food. Then they quickly fall back to sleep. Hibernating animals wake in the spring, when the weather is warm. They look for food. Hibernates: It curls up and sleeps in its nest. When will it wake? Some animals get ready for the winter in other ways. Those ways help them survive the cold. Arctic Fox—Adapt: Some animals adapt to the cold. Their fur changes color to blend in with the snow. Frog—Hide: Some animals hide under rocks, leaves, or mud. Sometimes they stay inside logs to keep warm. Ladybugs—Diapause: Some insects hibernate. When insects hibernate, it is called diapause.

They also say a new toothbrush will help you get your teeth cleaner. 1. Put a pea-sized bit of toothpaste on your toothbrush. Place your brush near your gum. 2. Gently move your brush in small circles over one tooth at a time. 3. Move your brush across the tops of your teeth. Be sure to get into the grooves. 4. Brush your tongue lightly. Then rinse your mouth with water. 5. Floss your teeth. Slide the f loss between teeth slowly. If you need help, ask a grown-up.	2
The ocean is filled with many different kinds of animals. This sea turtle lives in the upper zone of the water. An ocean is a large body of salt water. It can be divided into three zones, or layers. The deeper the water, the colder it gets. Why? Sunlight reaches only the water near the ocean's surface. Take a look in each zone to see some of the animals that live there. The top layer of the ocean is called the sunlit zone. It is lit by enough sunlight for plants to grow. All plants and most marine animals live in this zone. Whales live here because they need to swim to the surface to breathe air. Some fish here have special shapes to protect them from predators. A predator is an animal that eats another animal for food. The porcupine fish puffs up and raises its spines when danger is near. The ocean is colder in the twilight zone. Only dim light reaches this area. There is not enough light for plants to grow. Fewer sea creatures are found here than in the sunlit zone. Jellyfish and octopuses are often found here. Many jellyfish have stinging tentacles that they use to defend themselves and to capture prey. Prey is an animal that is caught and eaten by a predator. Octopuses use the suction cups on their tentacles to hold on to prey. It is pitch-dark and very cold in the midnight zone. No plants grow here. Many of the animals have sharp teeth and big jaws. Other creatures, such as the ratfish, have large eyes to see in the dark. Ratfish swim along the bottom of the ocean and eat smaller sea animals, such as shrimp and sea stars. Some animals, like the hatchetfish, have body parts that glow in the dark. That helps them to attract prey.	2
Earth has seven continents, or landmasses. When you look at a globe or a map, you will see the continents. Home, Sweet Home! North America is where we live. It is the continent that produces the most corn. Corn is used to feed people and animals. It can also be used as fuel to heat homes and help automobiles run. An Ancient City South America is the site of Machu Picchu (MAH-choo PEEchoo). That city was built hundreds of years ago by people called the Incas. That ancient city is high in the Andes Mountains in Peru. Tilting Tower Europe is home to the Leaning Tower of Pisa. That is a famous tower in Italy. The tower was built on soil made up of sand and clay. Some parts of the building have sunk into the ground more than others. A Salty Sea Asia is the largest continent and is the site of the salty Dead Sea. That body of water is a lake not a sea. Nothing can live in the water because it is so salty. The high levels of salt help people float easily. That's Hot! Africa is the hottest continent. It is also home to some of the biggest animals in the world. The African elephant is the largest living land mammal, and the ostrich is the largest living bird. Those animals can really take the heat! The Big Chill Antarctica is the coldest place on Earth. Animals in Antarctica, such as penguins, whales, and seals, have a thick layer of fat called blubber. That helps them survive the cold weather.	2

"Astronomers recently kicked Pluto out of the family of planets. Astronomers are scientists who study the universe beyond Earth. What is a planet? Scientists finally decided on a definition. They said a planet must be almost round and must orbit the sun in its own path. Plutoâ€™s orbit crossed Neptuneâ€™s path, so scientists named Pluto a dwarf planet. That is the name they gave to a new group of small objects in space. ""These dwarf planets are popping up everywhere,"" says astronomer Alan Stern. In January 2006, a spacecraft blasted off to explore Pluto. At that time, Pluto was the last unvisited planet. Now it may become the first visited dwarf planet. The spacecraft is scheduled to arrive in 2015. What might the scientists discover about Pluto?"	2

Last year, pumpkin grower Larry Checkon won the annual Pennsylvania Giant Pumpkin Growerâ€™s Association Weigh-Off. His pumpkin weighed 1,469 pounds. Thatâ€™s about as heavy as 25 second graders! More than 3,000 pumpkins were entered in the contest. After the weigh-off, master carver Scott Cully spent about 10 hours carving the winning pumpkin into a jack-oâ€™-lantern. How big will this yearâ€™s winning pumpkin be? Pumpkin Vine: A vine begins to grow. In about four weeks, a yellow f lower forms.	2
"Can a 10-year-old shelter dog get a part in a New York play? Thatâ€™s what happened to Whiskey, a cocker spaniel that recently won a role in the play Annie. The play is about a girl who looks for a family to care for her. Whiskey and 11 of his dog friends auditioned, or tried out, for the part. The judges needed a friendly dog, and they found that in Whiskey. Susan Richmond is a director at the Humane Society of New York, where Whiskey lives. She says that Whiskey is a gentle dog. ""Animals in shelters are wonderful animals,"" says Richmond."	2
Many animals live in a tropical rain forest. Some of them have bright colors. The red-eyed tree frog is one of those animals. A tropical rain forest is a warm, wet place. It is a home for many animals. Many kinds of plants grow there too. Read about the layers of a rain forest. The emergent layer is the top layer. It is made up of the tops of the very tallest trees. It is home to many birds and insects. Macaws fly up in the trees here. They like to scream loudly to each other. These birds eat fruits, nuts, and flowers. The canopy is made up of the tops of most other rain forest trees. It is home to many animals. Sloths hang upside down from tree branches here. Big, strong claws on the sloth's feet help it grab a branch. The furry sloth does not move much. U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service The understory is a dark, cool layer under the leaves of many trees. Emerald tree boas wrap around branches of trees here. The boa hunts at night to catch birds and other small animals. This snake can open its jaws wide enough to swallow a bird whole! The forest floor is dark and damp. Not much sunlight reaches it. Leaf-cutter ants work hard here, using their sharp jaws to cut pieces of leaves. This ant carries leaves that are 20 times its weight. That is like a person carrying a 1-ton load!	2
A fisherman in Japan recently spotted a rare shark. Staff at a nearby marine park discovered that it was a frilled shark. They caught the shark and took it to the park. The staff filmed it swimming and opening its jaws. Frilled sharks are sometimes caught in fishing nets, but they are rarely seen alive. That is because their natural home is between 2,000 and 3,000 feet underwater, in the twilight zone. The shark died a few hours after it was caught. Scientists believe it came close to the surface of the ocean because it was sick.	2

Tropical rain forests are in danger of disappearing, but children are working hard to protect them. They are raising money by holding bake sales, collecting pennies, and even selling T-shirts! That money will help save rain forest land and the animals that live there. Experts want to protect rain forests because they are home to half of the world's plants and animals. Rain forest plants give us medicines, fruits, nuts, and spices.	2
A volcano is an opening in the ground or on top of a mountain. Kilauea is one of the world's most active volcanoes. Kilauea is almost always erupting. Scientists say that there are more than 500 active volcanoes in the world. When a volcano erupts, lava, rocks, and gas burst out. (1) The magma heats up. Magma is hot liquid rock deep inside Earth. The magma chamber or pool is a place where magma collects. (2) The magma rises up. The central vent is an opening at the top from which rocks, gases, and lava can spill or burst. The cracks along the sides of the volcano are called side vents. (3) The volcano erupts! The plume is the hot puff of gases and smoke that blows out of the top. Scientists study volcanoes to try to predict when they might erupt. Why might scientists want to predict that?	2
School has changed in some ways over time. Letâ€™s learn about those ways. Schools did not always have computers. How is school today different from school many years ago? Then: Many schoolhouses had only one classroom. Students of all ages learned together. Now: Most school buildings have many classrooms. Students in each class are about the same age. Students listened carefully to a phonograph. That is a machine that plays recordings. Then: Students raised their hands to answer questions. The teacher called on students to respond. Now: Students still raise their hands to answer questions. That is one way school has not changed.	2
More than 100 spiders are crawling around a museum in California. The Natural History Museum created a world just for those spiders in its greenhouse. A greenhouse is a heated glass building. Visitors can see many different kinds of spiders, such as the golden silk spider. That is one of the largest spiders in North and South America. Golden silk spiders build strong webs.	2

Winter is a baby bottlenose dolphin who lost her tail in an accident. Scientists want to help her by giving her a prosthesis (prahs-THEE-suss). That is a human-made part to replace a missing body part. In spite of her injury, Winter behaves like a can-do dolphin. She has learned to swim without her tail, by moving from side to side. If the new tail works, she will be able to move up and down in the water, the way other dolphins swim.	2
Thanksgiving is a time for people to give thanks. Many people eat turkey on Thanksgiving. Long ago, the Pilgrims and Native Americans gave thanks. Joseph Bruchac (JB) is a Native American writer and storyteller. Weekly Reader (WR) asked him to share his thoughts about Thanksgiving. WR: How do you celebrate Thanksgiving? JB: My family gathers for a big meal. We say a few words in our native language of Abenaki around the table to express our thanks. WR: What does Thanksgiving mean to Native Americans? JB: Native people give thanks for all things. Different groups have many thanksgiving festivals during the year. WR: What is the history of Thanksgiving? JB: Native Americans were one of the first to have a fall harvest festival. Squanto and other Native Americans taught the Pilgrims how to survive in a new land. The Pilgrims shared their first harvest with the Native Americans. In 1620, the Pilgrims landed in what is now Massachusetts. Squanto showed the Pilgrims which crops to grow, such as corn, beans, and squash. He showed them which animals to hunt and where to fish. The Pilgrims had a good fall harvest. A harvest is a gathering of food that has been grown. They shared their food at a feast with Squanto and other Native Americans.	2

"Experts at the American Museum of Natural History in New York recently found some surprising news. They discovered that most people did not know that threefourths of Earth is covered with water. Very few people knew that only 1 percent of the world's water is drinkable. What could the museum do? The museum decided to create a special exhibit that teaches visitors about water. The exhibit will open in 2008. ""We have the opportunity to educate the public about issues of ... concern to them,"" said museum president Ellen Futter. The museum will design the exhibit based on what people want to know about water."	2

April 22 is Earth Day. That day reminds everyone to take care of Earth, our home. Many of Earth's animals are in danger of losing their homes. The pika (PEE-kah) is an animal whose habitat is in danger. A habitat is a place in nature where an animal or a plant lives. U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service Pikas are related to rabbits. Some kinds of pikas live on the rocky slopes of mountains. These animals prefer cool weather. As Earth heats up, they must move to cooler places higher in the mountains. Scarlet macaws make their nests in the holes of rain forest trees. People are cutting down those trees and using the land for farms. Macaws are running out of trees in which to make their nests. Polar bears live in the Arctic. They live on large pieces of sea ice. As Earth's temperature rises, the large pieces of sea ice begin to melt. If the ice keeps melting, polar bears will have nowhere to live. Tigers live in the grasslands of Asia. Their habitat is shrinking because people are building towns in places that used to belong to the tigers. Now these big cats have fewer grassland areas to call home. Scientists say Earth is getting warmer because of pollution in the air. They are working to protect animal habitats. Dispose of trash properly. Recycle plastic, glass, paper, and metal.	2

"A bouncing baby gorilla was recently born at Zoo Atlanta, in Atlanta, Georgia. Five gorillas have been born at the zoo in the past 10 months. ""Weâ€™ve had a baby boom,"" said Susan Elliott, an expert at the zoo. ""Itâ€™s really exciting to watch the babies play and swing."" The newest baby was born to Sukari, a female, and Taz, a male. Taz is a silverback gorilla. He has a patch of silver hair on his back. The baby gorilla is getting used to its new family and life at the zoo."	2
Scientists in California recently explored a large inactive, underwater volcano. They were looking for ways to protect this special sea mountain that is home to many animals. Bright yellow sea sponges and 10-foot-tall pink coral live there. It is located deep below the surface of the Pacific Ocean off the coast of California. Its name is Davidson Seamount. The rocks there make good homes for deep-sea animals. Scientists used a remote control vehicle to help them explore the volcano. It took photos and collected bits of rock and coral. Scientists say that we must find ways to protect this place or we will lose these sea creatures forever.	2
"People are not the only ones who work hard at their jobs. Some worms in California are also hard at work recycling garbage in offices. In those offices, red worms wiggle inside plastic bins and munch on apple cores, lettuce leaves, sandwich scraps, and other leftover foods. The worms create waste material that can be used as fertilizer. That helps plants grow. Some workers are grossed out by the worms, but others are not. Some people have learned about worms just by sharing an office with them. ""Worms donâ€™t like ranch dressing,"" says Andrew Hurst, a member of the California Environmental Protection Agency. His office welcomes worms too!"	2

"Good news for the bald eagle! The bird was recently taken off the U.S. endangered species list. That is a list of animals and plants that are in danger of dying out. ""It's exciting that the bald eagle is back and so healthy. It is a beautiful bird and the symbol of our nation,"" says Martha Nudel. She is a spokesperson for the National Wildlife Refuge System. ""We know that we're protecting the planet in a way that is helping bald eagles and hundreds of other birds."" Bald eagles were in danger because many of them had been killed by hunters. They were also harmed by a chemical called DDT. It had been used to kill insects on farms until 1972. In 1963, only 417 nesting pairs of bald eagles were left in the continental United States. That included all of the states except Hawaii and Alaska. Today, there are nearly 10,000 pairs. Though bald eagles are no longer on the endangered species list, they are still protected. Killing a bald eagle is illegal, or against the law. The bald eagle is a symbol of our country. It was chosen as our national bird in 1782. Read about some other U.S. symbols. The faces of four U.S. presidents are carved into Mount Rushmore. That is a mountain in South Dakota. The 50 stars on the American flag stand for the 50 states. The 13 stripes stand for the 13 colonies. The Liberty Bell is known for its famous crack. You can visit the bell in Pennsylvania. If you were asked to create a new American symbol, what would it be? Why?"	2
It is time to celebrate poetry. Poetry is a type of writing that lets people express, or show, their emotions. Some poems rhyme, and some do not. This month, everyone can take part in the fun. Many people will go to poetry readings to hear poets read their work. Kids will read and write poems in school too. In this issue, you will learn about three types of poems. Then write a poem of your own! A couplet is a poem that has only two lines. The last words in each line rhyme. Spring Blossoms When rain comes down in drippity drops, Umbrellas go up with poppity pops. —Marie E. Cecchini In an acrostic poem, each line describes a topic word. Each letter of the word starts a new line. This poem about spring uses the letters in the word spring to begin each line. Spring Sunny days are coming. Pretty birds chirp early in the morning. Rain falls from the sky. Insects buzz and crawl. New baby animals take their first steps. Green grass grows, and flowers bloom! —Nicole Diaz A quatrain is a poem that has four lines. The last words in the second and fourth lines must rhyme. Write the two words in the poem that rhyme. Sunflower Leaves of green, Petals so bright, It grows quite tall. A beautiful sight! —Rachelle Kreisman Which poem do you like best? How does it make you feel?	2
What do termites, ants, and honeybees have in common? They are all social (SOH-shuhl) insects. Social insects live together in large groups called colonies. Social insects always have at least one queen. The queen is the mother. She lays the eggs. The rest of the group divides the work. Ants often live in underground nests. The nests have thousands of rooms connected by tunnels. Millions of ants may live together in a nest. It can contain more than one queen. Worker ants take care of all the other ants. Larger worker ants are called soldier ants. Their job is to guard the nest. Life in a honeybee hive is busy. Up to 60,000 bees may live together. Only one queen bee lives in a hive. Worker bees do all the chores. They care for the young bees and the queen. They clean and guard the hive and control the hive’s temperature. The workers also make food for all the bees in the hive. Termites build tall nests in wood or soil. A nest can be up to 40 feet high. Millions of termites may live in one nest. Every colony has a king and a queen. They make the eggs. Worker termites build the nest and care for the eggs. Soldier termites protect the colony.	2
Cockroaches are not social insects, but they do live in groups. Scientists wanted to learn more about how cockroaches make group decisions. To do that, they created tiny robots that smelled like real roaches. Cockroaches like to rest together in dark places. The scientists put the robots with a group of roaches. Soon, the robots and roaches were all resting together in a dark place. Then the robots were placed in a light area. When the roaches saw the robots, they ended up resting in the light area too. What did scientists learn from the study? A few cockroaches can change how the whole group behaves. The robotic cockroaches did not look like real insects. However, the real roaches did not notice. That is because scientists made sure that the robots smelled like roaches.	2
"Many kids are checking their coins for new state quarters. This year, they can complete their collections. The U.S. Mint will release the last five of the 50 state quarters starting this month. The U.S. Mint is the place that makes coins. The 50 State Quarters Program began in 1999. Since then, the U.S. Mint has made five new state quarters each year. The coins are released to the public in the order in which each state became part of the United States. The front, or heads side, of each state quarter is the same. They all have a picture of George Washington. He was the first president of the United States. He became president in 1789. The back, or tails side, of each state quarter is unique (yoo-NEEK). That means one of a kind. The design shows something special about that state. ""The program teaches people about the rich history of the states,"" says Michael White. He is a spokesperson for the U.S. Mint. Many kids and adults started collecting coins in 1999 because of the new state quarters. ""It is, by far, the most popular and successful program in U.S. Mint history,"" says White. ""More than 140 million Americans collect them."" The main office of the U.S. Mint is in Washington, D.C. Offices are also located in five other cities across the United States. Study the map to learn more. 1. Washington, D.C.; 2. Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; 3. West Point, New York; 4. Fort Knox, Kentucky; 5. Denver, Colorado; 6. San Francisco, California. If you could design your own state quarter, what would it look like? Why?"	2
"Many kids are excited about new toys that teach both Spanish and English. Many of the toys talk. Some toys also sing. There are dolls, games, and books. Toy companies think they will become more and more popular. Weekly Reader spoke to toy expert Adrienne Citron. She said that kids of all cultures are interested in Hispanic television characters such as Dora and Diego. Culture is the way of life of a group of people. ""Any family can have fun with these new toys,"" says Citron. ""The toys are great. They let everyone be a part of the Hispanic culture!"""	2
"What do Tyrannosaurus rex and the chicken have in common? A team of scientists say the two animals are related. Recently, the scientists studied a T. rex bone that shows proof of that. Proof is anything that can be used to show that something is true. The T. rex bone was part of a dinosaur's leg. It is 68 million years old. Scientists found it in Montana in 2003. They cut into the bone and were surprised to find protein inside. Protein is a living material that makes up muscle. It is also found inside bone. Lewis Cantley is a scientist on the research team. ""We were very excited,"" he says. ""No one thought that protein could survive that long."" Scientists used a special machine to study the protein. They compared it to the proteins in other animals. Chickens were the closest relatives. Many scientists have long thought that dinosaurs and birds are related. The recent discovery is more proof. ""Previous proof was based on the way the bones looked. This proof is based on protein,"" says Cantley. ""It better supports our beliefs that chickens came from dinosaurs."" This year, scientists plan to look for more dinosaur bones to study. ""We want to find other dinosaur bones that contain protein,"" says Cantley. ""That would give us even more proof."" Imagine that T. rex and the chicken were the same size. Would they look related? Take a look at the photos to see for yourself. How are they alike? How are they different?"	2
"April 22 is Earth Day! That day reminds people to take care of our planet. Many kids and adults will take part in the Great American Cleanup. It is held each year from March 1 to May 31. Weekly Reader spoke with Gail Cunningham. She is in charge of the Great American Cleanup. She says, ""People should get into the habit of taking care of Earth all year long."" Here are some ways people can help. People will clean up beaches and parks this year. They will pick up litter, or trash. Animals can mistake litter for food and choke on it. Last year, volunteers for the Great American Cleanup collected more than 200 million pounds of litter. Many people will plant trees. Last year, volunteers planted more than 4 million trees. Trees are very important. They help clean the air. They also give off a gas called oxygen. People and animals need oxygen to live. People will recycle paper, bottles, and cans. When something is recycled, it is made into something new. Volunteers collected more than 70 million plastic bottles last year. The bottles were recycled, and a company used them to make backpacks for kids. This year, the bottles will be made into fleece jackets. Those jackets will be given to kids who don't have enough warm clothing. ""It is wonderful to turn plastic bottles into something fantastic,"" says Cunningham. How does recycling help Earth? What are some other ways to take care of Earth?"	2
"Lunch is now much tastier at Wright Elementary School in Nevada. The menu changed, thanks to a class of second graders. The students did not like eating green beans. What did they do about it? They wrote letters to the school's food service. ""The food is great, but there's one problem. The kids don't like green beans,"" wrote one student. Another letter said, ""We love lunch, but we were wondering if you can pretty please change the green beans."" The food service officials read all the letters. They asked the kids for their help. Read the steps below to see how students changed the lunch menu. Now all the kids can enjoy the new vegetable choices. How many colors do you eat? Brightly colored fruits and vegetables are healthy. Experts say kids should eat a rainbow of colors. Each color helps the body in a different way. Read the chart to learn more. Along with fruits and vegetables, what are other healthy foods? Why is eating healthy food important?"	2
"The NFPA wants to sound the alarm about the need for a home fire escape plan. They want people across the country to practice their fire escape plans this month.

Water is always on the move! It moves from the ground to the air and back again. That repeated trip is called the water cycle. 1 Evaporation: The sun heats oceans, lakes, and rivers. Tiny drops of water move up into the air. 3 Precipitation: The water drops get heavy. They fall back down as rain or snow. 4 Collection: The water soaks into the land and collects in oceans, lakes, and rivers. Then the water cycle starts again.	2
It's Thanksgiving time! Each fall, Americans celebrate this holiday on the fourth Thursday in November. This year it takes place on November 22. The first Thanksgiving feast took place in 1621. The Pilgrims and Native Americans had a feast to celebrate the harvest. A harvest is a gathering of food that has been grown. That harvest feast helped start the American tradition of Thanksgiving. Today, people still share food with their families and friends on this special day.	2
Oprah Winfrey has her own television talk show and magazine. She uses much of the money she earns to help others. Winfrey has a charity called the Angel Network. People donate, or give, money to the charity. The money is used to help people throughout the world. Robert L. Curbeam Jr. is an astronaut. When he was a boy, he wanted to design rockets. He now works for NASA. That is the U.S. space agency. Curbeam has been on three spaceflights. He has spent more than 900 hours in space! Nikki Giovanni is a writer. She is the author of books and poems for children and adults. She has won many awards for her poetry. In 2005, she wrote a children's book called Rosa. It is about the life of Rosa Parks. (See story below.) Savion Glover is a tap dancer. He also creates new dances. Glover has won many awards. He has been tap dancing since he was a boy. At the age of 10, he starred in The Tap Dance Kid. The show was on a Broadway stage in New York City. Since then, Glover has danced in television shows and in movies. Rosa Parks helped to change a law that was unfair to African American people. That law said that African Americans had to sit in the back of city buses. One day in 1955, Parks was riding on a city bus in Montgomery, Alabama. The driver told her to give her seat to a white person. She refused to move. To refuse means to decide not to do something. Thousands of people heard this story and refused to ride the city buses in Montgomery. One year later, the law was changed.	2
Martin Luther King Jr. was a leader. He lived from 1929 to 1968. Americans honor him in January with a national holiday. This year, Martin Luther King Jr. Day is January 21. King grew up in the southern part of the United States. At that time, laws treated African American people differently from white people. African Americans were forced to sit in the back of buses. They also had to use separate bathrooms and water fountains. When King was older, he worked to change those laws. As a result, equal rights laws were passed. Those laws provide the same rights to all Americans. King will soon be honored with a memorial. A memorial is a statue or a place that honors a person or an event. The King memorial is being built on the National Mall. That is a park in Washington, D.C., our nation's capital. Memorials for some U.S. presidents are also on the Mall. The King memorial is scheduled to be finished this year. It will have a 30-foot statue of King. Sentences from some of his speeches will be carved into a stone wall. The cost of the memorial is $100 million. Most of that money has been raised. A concert was held in September in New York City to raise the rest of the money. Many famous singers performed. The singers included Aretha Franklin, Stevie Wonder, and Garth Brooks.	2
What would life be like without inventions? It’s hard to imagine. An invention is a new thing or idea. It can change the way people live. Some inventions solve problems and make life easier. Other inventions make life more fun (or tastier!). Read about some great inventions. The next time you stick on a Band-Aid, you can thank Earle Dickson. He invented the ready-made bandage in 1920. He wanted to help his wife who often cut her fingers while cooking. At the time, people had to cut pieces of gauze and tape to make bandages. They were hard to use. Dickson’s simple idea was a big success. Today, ready-made bandages come in many shapes, sizes, and colors. Did you know that chocolate chip cookies were a mistake? Ruth Graves Wakefield created them in the 1930s. She was mixing a batch of chocolate cookies and was out of baking chocolate. She decided to chop up a bar of semisweet chocolate instead. When the cookies were done, the pieces of chocolate had not melted! They had kept their chip form in each cookie. Before the 1920s, people often got into traffic accidents. One day, Garrett Morgan saw a bad accident between a car and a horse-drawn carriage. He decided to solve the problem by inventing a traffic signal. It was a pole with signs saying when to stop and go. Today’s red, yellow, and green traffic lights are based on Morgan’s idea. What other inventions can you name? Which of those inventions do you think is the most important?	2

Inventing is not just for adults. Kids from across the country recently showed off their great ideas. They took part in a contest to create a new use for Bubble Wrap. Bubble Wrap is a packing material that has air-filled plastic bubbles. It is used to protect objects that are breakable. Andy Boler, age 10, from Texas, used Bubble Wrap to make a cover for plants. It protects plants from the cold. “I like building things that could help people,” he says. Other inventions in the contest included a kite-making kit and a wrist cushion. Some of the kids’ inventions may be turned into real products. “We have very few rules,” says a contest spokesperson. “One of the main goals is to get young students thinking.”	2

"Many people like the taste of sweet corn. But corn is not just for eating. Corn can be found in more than 3,000 products—toothpaste, crayons, and rubber tires, to name just a few. Corn is also used to make a special fuel for cars. That fuel is called ethanol. This year, farmers are growing the largest amount of corn since 1944. Experts say that is because people are using more ethanol. ""Oil and ethanol are used to make gasoline to put in your car,"" says Nick Weber. He is a spokesperson at the National Corn Growers Association. ""Oil has become very expensive. Ethanol is cheaper than oil—to produce and for consumers."" A consumer is someone who buys a product or service. Oil comes from the remains of plants and animals. It takes millions of years to form. Unlike oil, ethanol will not run out. ""Farmers can keep planting corn and turn it into food or fuel,"" says Weber. Gasoline made with oil pollutes the air. When the air is polluted, it becomes dirty. That can make people and animals sick. Ethanol keeps the air cleaner. ""Many people now know ethanol's benefit as a fuel,"" says Weber. ""It's good for farmers, consumers, and our planet."""	2
"Students at Richardsville Elementary School in Kentucky know how to put on a great show! They recently performed a musical play to honor Abraham Lincoln. It is called Lincoln: A Man for All Times. State officials and teachers from all over Kentucky went to see the play. The students sang a new song called ""A Man for All Times."" It was written by Kentucky songwriter Glen Rice. ""The song is a tribute to Lincoln's life,"" says the school's music teacher, Pam Thurman. A tribute is a something done to show thanks or respect. Second grader Christopher Hayes was in the play.

Jody Naranjo (nah-RON-hoh) is a potter. She makes pots out of clay. Her mother, grandmother, and aunts make pottery too. Naranjo is a Native American from the Santa Clara Pueblo group. She lives in New Mexico. Her work can be seen in museums across the country. About 4½ million people in the United States are Native American. They live in cities and towns across the country. Some Native Americans live on reservations. A reservation is land set aside for Native Americans by the U.S. government. Native Americans belong to more than 500 different groups. Each group has its own traditions.	2
Scientists are hopping with joy. They recently found a new species, or type, of frog. It lives in Colombia. That is a country in South America. The frog is very small. It is less than an inch long. Its skin is a golden color. Scientists say the frog is part of a group called poison dart frogs. The frog's poison may injure or kill an animal that eats it. That is why poison dart frogs are so colorful. Their bright colors warn predators to keep away. A predator is an animal that eats another animal for food.	2
Many people chew sugar-free gum today. Did people chew gum thousands of years ago? Scientists say yes. A 5,000-year-old lump of gum was recently dug up. It even had tooth marks on it! The gum was made from tree bark tar. One expert explains that the tar was boiled and cooled. Then it was heated again to make it soft enough for people to chew. Scientists say the sticky tar might have been used to treat mouth infections. They believe that people who chewed the gum might also have used it as a glue to fix things, such as pots. A college student found the gum in Finland. That is a country in Europe. The student was helping scientists dig for artifacts. An artifact is an object made by people who lived in the past.	2
Scientists recently made a surprising discovery. They found the remains of a giant penguin. It was about 5 feet tall! That is much larger than any penguin alive today. In fact, it is the third-largest bird known to have ever lived. The giant penguin had a long, sharp beak. It was almost a foot long. The beak looked like a spear, say scientists.

"Celebrate Constitution Day! Get to know the U.S. Constitution. Constitution Day is September 17. On that day, students across the United States will learn about the Constitution. That is a written plan that tells the laws of our country. A law is a rule. A group of leaders wrote the United States Constitution more than 200 years ago. George Washington was one of those leaders. The U.S. Constitution was signed in 1787. Learn more below. The Constitution was written by hand. It has more than 4,000 words and starts, ""We the People ... "" Our country had only 13 states when the Constitution was written. It has 50 states today. Benjamin Franklin was the oldest person to sign the Constitution. At the time, he was 81. A letter from George Washington was found recently. A 10-year-old girl had saved it in a scrapbook in 1826. The letter was sent to her grandfather, Jacob Morris. The girl lived in New Jersey. Her name was Julia Kean. Washington wrote the letter in 1787. At that time, he was meeting with other leaders to create the U.S. Constitution. In the letter, Washington wrote that the country's happiness depended on what the leaders decided. Two years later, he became our country's first president. The letter is important, say history experts. It helps people learn more about our country's past."	2
For kids in parts of Africa, it is also a way to get clean water to their communities. How? The merry-go-rounds pump water out of the ground. They are called PlayPump water systems. Kids in Africa play on a PlayPump merry-go-round. It pumps clean water out of the ground. People need clean water for drinking, cooking, cleaning, and bathing. Many people around the world do not have clean water. In some parts of Africa, women and girls have to walk miles to get clean water. People are raising money now for more PlayPump systems. By 2010, they hope to have 4,000 PlayPumps in Africa. The PlayPump water is stored in a tank. Now it is easy for people to get clean water.	2

"Get ready to rock! It's a special year for the Grand Canyon. It was named a national monument 100 years ago. A national monument is a place that is protected by the United States government. A canyon is a long, narrow valley with high cliffs on each side. Canyons are often carved by fast-moving rivers. The Grand Canyon is in Arizona. It was carved by the Colorado River. The river still flows through the Grand Canyon and wears away the rock. Each year, about 5 million people visit the Grand Canyon. Scientists are working to protect the area. They do that by studying changes in the canyon. They want to make sure the natural wonder is around for hundreds of years. Expert Andy Pearce teaches kids about the canyon. ""It is a unique landscape,"" he says. ""There is really nothing else like it in the world."""	2
A reptile is an animal that has hard, dry skin. Turtles are the only reptiles that have shells. Most reptiles have clawed feet and walk on four legs. Can you name a reptile that has no legs? A snake! Other reptiles include alligators, crocodiles, and lizards. Most reptiles lay eggs on land. Baby reptiles hatch from the eggs. A leaf-tailed gecko, like the one shown on the cover, lays two eggs at a time. The corn snake lays up to 30 eggs at once! The boa constrictor is a snake that does not lay eggs. It gives birth to baby snakes. An amphibian is an animal that spends part of its life in water and part on land. Most have smooth, wet skin. Frogs, toads, newts, and salamanders are amphibians. Most amphibians hatch from eggs. The eggs are usually in or near water. Young amphibians breathe through gills. When they get older, they breathe with lungs. Most adult amphibians live on land. For example, you young frogs that hatch from eggs are called tadpoles. Tadpoles live in water and move like fish. After they grow legs, they can hop on land. If you could be any reptile or amphibian, what would you be? Why?	2
"If you think spiderwebs are weak, think again! Spiderwebs are made of silk. That is one of the strongest materials. In fact, silk is stronger than the same amount of steel! A spider squeezes a sticky liquid from its body. That liquid hardens into a strong silk thread. Scientists are working to make silk that is as strong as a spider's. They are getting closer to learning how. ""We use lots of different machines to see how spiders make their silk,"" says scientist Chris Holland. ""The machines can show us how strong the silk is and what it is made of."" Holland says, ""We recently discovered that to make silk like a spider's, we have to start with the right material. We have been using a material that was too runny. In spiders, it is thick like mayonnaise [MAY-uh-nayz]."" Scientists hope their work will help produce, or make, a stronger silk. It may be used to make clothes that are strong but light in weight. The clothes may one day protect soldiers and astronauts. A grass spider uses silk to make a shelter. A shelter is a place where an animal lives. An orb weaver spider makes a sticky web to trap prey. A spider's prey is any animal that it eats. What other things in nature are useful to people? How?"	2
Smile! Healthy teeth make you look great and feel happy. Munch. Crunch. Without your chompers, you would have trouble chewing food. Your teeth also help you speak and sing clearly. Fa, la, la, la! Now say the word thanks. Notice that you need your teeth to say the th sound. Keeping your teeth in tip-top shape is important. Taking care of your teeth keeps plaque (PLAK) from building up. Plaque is a sticky film that can cause gum disease and cavities. A cavity is a hole in a tooth. Dentists recommend these helpful tips to remove plaque and keep your teeth healthy. 1 Brush twice a day with a soft-bristle toothbrush. Make sure you brush for two to three minutes. Hum a song or time yourself to make sure you brush long enough. Brushing your tongue will help freshen your breath. Replace your toothbrush every three months. 2 Floss gently once a day. Flossing cleans between your teeth. Don't forget to floss behind the last tooth in each row. 4 Eat foods that are good for you. Those foods include fresh fruits, raw vegetables, and cheese.	2
Hurricane season is here. A hurricane is a storm that forms over warm ocean water. It brings strong winds and heavy rains. The season lasts from June to November. Experts say the 2007 season will be a busy one. They want to make sure people are prepared. U.S. Air Force photo/Tech. Sgt. Shane A. Cuomo Hurricanes can damage trees, cars, and buildings. A hurricane's strong winds can also make ocean levels rise. That is called a storm surge. It happens when a hurricane travels over water. The strong winds push against the water. The water gets higher and higher. As the hurricane passes over land, the water pushes onto the shore. The rising water can cause flooding. Hurricane Hunters are ready. They are a part of the U.S. Air Force Reserve. Their job is to fly airplanes into the eye of a hurricane! The eye is the calm center. Inside the storm, the hunters measure the amount of rain and the speed of the wind. Their work helps weather experts predict where the hurricane will go and how strong it will become. 1. First, small storms begin over an ocean. 2. Then strong winds make the storms spin around and come together. 3. Soon, a hurricane forms. It spins around and around. Sometimes it moves over land and brings heavy rains and strong winds. Would you want to be a Hurricane Hunter in the U.S. Air Force? Why or why not?	2

"It's time for monarch butterflies to take a trip. Each fall, they migrate south for the winter. The word migrate means ""to move from one place to another."" Many monarchs leave Canada and the United States to travel to Mexico. Others go to California, Texas, or Florida. In the winter, monarchs stay close together on trees. That helps protect them from wind, rain, and cold. The trees look bright orange because they are covered with millions of butterflies! In the spring, monarchs migrate north. On the way, female monarchs stop to lay eggs. A baby caterpillar hatches from each egg. Many of the new monarch butterflies finish the trip north. Second graders at Arlington Elementary School in Indiana are ready for a monarch visit. That school has a garden full of milkweed plants. Monarchs can rest, eat, and lay eggs there. Milkweed is the only type of plant where female monarchs lay their eggs. ""If the milkweed disappears, so do the monarchs!"" says teacher Edie McDonnel. The garden also has plants with nectar for the monarchs to eat. Nectar is a sweet liquid. ""Monarchs have to stop and eat along the way,"" McDonnel says."	2

Many kids love listening to music on their MP3 players. However, portable music players may not be good for the ears. Health experts say the music players may lead to hearing loss. Why? They send loud sounds straight into the ears. Hearing loss is also more likely if you listen to loud music for hours at a time. Experts say kids need to give their ears a rest. They warn that at least 12 out of 100 children are at risk of losing some of their hearing. How do you know if your music is too loud? If you are wearing your earphones, you should be able to hear someone talking to you from a few feet away. You can also ask friends if they can hear the music from your earphones. If they say yes, turn it down!	2

The Grand Canyon is made of nearly 40 different rock layers. The layers include sandstone, shale, and limestone. Those rocks are made from sediment. Sediment is small pieces of sand, clay, or seashells that are carried by water. Rocks and the sediment they contain are made of minerals. A mineral is a natural material found in the ground. Read the chart to learn more.	2
Dear Kids, We drew pictures of frogs today. Sara told Mario that his picture wasn't good. I think he feels sad. What can I do to cheer him up?	2
Dear Kids, Today we made a list of class rules. This is one of them: Listen to all ideas. Why is that rule important?	2
Space is an exciting place! Our solar system is in space. It is made up of the sun and the eight planets that travel around the sun. Our solar system also has moons, stars, and other space objects. The sun is at the center of our solar system. The sun is a hot, bright star. A star is a ball of hot gas. It gives off heat and light. The sun is the star closest to Earth. That is why it looks different from other stars. Most stars look tiny and can be seen only at night because they are so far away. A planet is a large ball made of rock or gas. Eight planets make up our solar system. You live on one of them—Earth! The others are Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune. Each planet moves in a path around the sun. The path is called an orbit. Earth has one moon. It travels in an orbit around Earth. The moon is made of rock. It is covered with deep holes called craters. The moon may look as though it gives off light, but it does not. It looks bright when it reflects light from the sun.	2
Bats are shy and gentle animals. Some people are afraid of bats. That is usually because they don’t know these facts about bats. Bats are the only mammals that can fly. A mammal is a warm-blooded animal that has fur or hair on its body. Female mammals feed Bats are nocturnal. That means they sleep during the day and are active at night. Bats sleep hanging upside down. Most bats live in caves and trees. A bat’s home is called a roost. Most bats feed on insects. One bat can eat hundreds of insects in an hour! Without bats, those insects would eat crops that farmers grow. Some bats eat fruits. They drop seeds in different places. That helps new plants grow.	2
How much do you know about Abraham Lincoln? Fill in the blanks to finish the chart below.	2
A reptile is an animal that has hard, dry skin. Reptiles are cold-blooded. Their body temperature changes as the temperature of the air or water they live in changes. Amazing facts: Chameleons can move their eyes separately and look in two different directions at the same time! Chameleons can also change colors. They might be green one moment and brown 20 seconds later. A mammal is an animal that has hair on its body. Mammals are warm-blooded. Their body stays about the same warm temperature in both hot and cold weather. Amazing facts: Cheetahs are the world’s fastest land animals. They can run as fast as 70 miles per hour. That is faster than most cars driving on a highway! Cheetahs can reach highway speeds in just a few seconds. However, they can run fast for only a short time. An amphibian is an animal that lives part of its life in water and part on land. Amphibians are cold-blooded. Most have smooth, wet skin. Amazing facts: The American bullfrog is the largest frog in North America. It can grow up to 8 inches long. How did this frog get its name? The frog’s call sounds like a cow. A bull is a male cow.	2
Martin Luther King Jr. was born on January 15, 1929, in Atlanta, Georgia. Each January, Americans honor him with a holiday. This year, Martin Luther King Jr. Day is January 19. When King was growing up, the laws in some places were unfair. Those laws treated African American people differently from white people. African Americans were not allowed to go to the same schools as white students. Many were also forced to sit in the back of buses. King’s birth home is in Atlanta, Georgia. Here he is at age 6. In the 1950s and 1960s, King worked to change unfair laws. He led peaceful marches and gave many speeches. In 1963, King gave his famous “I Have a Dream” speech. He said, “I have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character.” As a result of King’s hard work, equal rights laws were passed. Those laws make sure that all Americans are treated fairly and equally.	2
February is Black History Month. During this time, we remember important African Americans. Read about four people who made history. In 1947, Jackie Robinson changed history. He became the first African American to play majorleague baseball. He played for the Brooklyn Dodgers. Until then, African Americans were not allowed to play in the major leagues. Rosa Parks spent her life fighting for equal rights. Those rights make sure all people are treated fairly. In 1955, Parks was arrested in Alabama for not giving up her bus seat to a white person. Her brave act helped change unfair laws. George Washington Carver was an inventor. He was born on a farm in Missouri. He found more than 300 new uses for peanuts. Those uses include making soap, glue, and paint. Carver also taught people better ways to farm. Marian Anderson was a famous singer. In 1955, she became the first African American to sing a leading role at the Metropolitan Opera. That is an opera house in New York City. She was also the first African American to sing at the White House. Which of these four people would you most like to have met? Why?	2
Welcome to the Arctic! That is the cold, windy area around the North Pole. It includes the Arctic Ocean and the land near it. Snow and ice cover the ground for much of the year. The Arctic is a habitat, or place in nature where many animals live. The walrus, polar bear, and snowy owl are a few of those animals. They have different ways to survive the cold. A walrus spends most of its time in the icy water. This marine animal has a thick layer of blubber, or fat, under its skin to keep it warm. When a walrus swims, its body works in a special way to stay warm. Blood flows away from its skin to important organs inside its body. They include the heart and brain. That keeps heat from leaving the walrus’s body, and the animal’s skin turns white. When the walrus is warm again, its skin turns a pink color. A polar bear has special fur to keep it warm. Each hair is shaped like a straw. The shape helps direct sunlight toward the bear’s black skin. The black skin collects and holds in heat. Polar bears also have a layer of blubber under their skin. How does a snowy owl stay warm? It has two layers of feathers. They cover the owl’s entire body, including its legs and feet. The bottom layer of feathers, called down, is soft and fluffy. The outer layer of feathers is thick. In strong wind, the snowy owl may hide on the ground behind a pile of snow or rocks to block the wind.	2
The Arctic is feeling the heat. Its sea ice is melting. “The ice has been shrinking for more than 30 years,” says scientist Mark Serreze. “Over the past five years, it has been melting faster and faster.” Serreze works at the National Snow and Ice Data Center, which keeps track of how much snow and ice is on Earth. He predicts, “We could be looking at an ice-free Arctic in 2030.” Why is the ice melting? Earth is getting warmer. Scientists say that is because of pollution in the air. As Earth’s temperature rises, sea ice at the Arctic melts. “The animals there will have a hard time,” says Serreze.	2
A male zebra finch changes his song if a female zebra finch is nearby. A zebra finch is a bird. A bird is a warm-blooded animal with feathers on its body. Can the female tell when the male is singing just to her? A team of scientists recently learned that the answer is yes. They did an experiment using a recording of a male zebra finch singing. They placed female birds between two speakers. The first speaker played the song of a male zebra finch singing alone. The second speaker played a male singing for a female. Most of the female birds moved closer to the second speaker. “The males make very small changes to their songs,” says scientist Sarah C. Woolley. “We were excited to learn that the females can notice those changes and that they pay attention to them.”	2
November 11 is Veterans Day. On that holiday, Americans honor U.S. veterans. Veterans are men and women who have served in the military for our country. Many cities will hold events to honor veterans. The oldest and largest celebration is held in Birmingham, Alabama, each year. Veterans from all over the country attend. Events include an awards dinner and a parade. “We want to thank our veterans for their service,” says event planner Bill Voigt.	2
Learn about American women who made history. Some did great things long ago. Some are doing great things today. Althea Gibson was a tennis player. She made history in 1950, at age 23. She became the first African American to play in the U.S. National Tennis Championships. She later became the first African American to win the championships. Michelle Wie is a golfer. She started playing golf when she was 4 years old. At age 14, she became the youngest player to compete in a Professional Golfers’ Association tour event. Wie is 19 years old now. She has played against the best golfers in the world. Clara Barton was a teacher and a nurse. She started the American Red Cross. That is a group that helps people during floods, fires, and other disasters. Barton served as its first president from 1881 to 1904. Julie Louise Gerberding is a doctor. In 2002, she became the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. That group helps protect Americans across the country from disease. Laura Ingalls Wilder was an author. She wrote a series of children’s books about her life. Little House on the Prairie is one of those books. Wilder won many awards for her stories. In 1974, they were made into a hit television show. Kate DiCamillo is a children’s author. She has won many awards for her books. One of those books is Because of Winn-Dixie. In 2005, it was made into a movie. Her newest book is Louise, The Adventures of a Chicken. What do you want to be when you grow up? Why?	2
Chinese New Year is here! The holiday is the longest and most important celebration in China. It lasts for 15 days. This year, it began on January 26. Chinese New Year festivals take place in many cities across the United States. Each year in the Chinese calendar is named after an animal. This is the Year of the Ox. Kids carry bright lanterns in evening parades during the Lantern Festival. People wear a dragon costume and dance through the streets. The dragon is thought to bring good luck. The costume can be long—it may stretch more than 100 feet! That is longer than two school buses. The festival is held on the last day of the holiday. It also includes music and fireworks. People eat many special meals during Chinese New Year. They eat foods such as soup, dumplings, chicken, fish, and sweets. The foods stand for different wishes of luck. For example, dumplings stand for the wish of wealth. Sweets stand for a sweet new year. People wear red clothing during this holiday. The color red is thought to keep away bad luck. Homes are decorated with happy wishes written on red paper. Family and friends give kids small red envelopes. The envelopes are filled with money for good luck.	2
September 17 is the start of Constitution Week. Many events will take place across the country. One event is called America Reads the Constitution. Kids and adults will hear people read the Constitution at the National Constitution Center. That is a museum in Philadelphia. It is across the street from where the Constitution was signed. “September 17, 1787, is an important date in American history,” says a spokesperson for the museum. “America Reads is a chance to hear the words and ideas that formed our government.”	2
Large colorful globes are popping up around our planet. They are part of an art project called Cool Globes. Artists are creating the globes to remind people to take care of our planet. The project began in 2007 in Chicago, Illinois. The exhibit then traveled to other U.S. cities. This month, the globes will be in London, England. People can take simple actions to help Earth, says Wendy Abrams. She is the person who came up with the idea of Cool Globes. “We all have the power to do something, and together we can have an impact,” she says. An impact is the power of something to cause changes.	2
The United States is having money trouble. It now costs more than a penny to make a penny. A nickel costs nearly 8 cents to make. Why are those coins so costly? Copper, nickel, and zinc are metals that are going up in price. Copper and zinc are used to make pennies. Nickel and copper are used in nickels. Some lawmakers want the U.S Mint to use a cheaper metal: steel. It was used in pennies made in 1943, when there wasn’t enough copper. You won’t see new steel coins just yet. Other lawmakers first have to agree to the plan. The Lincoln penny turns 100 this year. Abraham Lincoln was our country’s 16th president. His picture has been on the penny since 1909.	2
What type of dinosaur had a nose that looked like a beak? Hadrosaurs! That is why they are often known as duck-billed dinosaurs. Hadrosaurs were plant eaters. They moved in herds, or groups. Most ate while standing on four legs. They were able to walk and run on two legs. Many scientists believe the crest was like a trumpet. The scientists say hadrosaurs used their crests to make sounds and send signals to one another.	2
Scientists have made a big discovery. They found the bones of a new type of hadrosaur. The bones were dug up in Mexico near the city of Saltillo (sahl-TEE-yoh). The dinosaur was 25 feet long. It was not fully grown, say scientists. An adult would have been about 35 feet long. Scientists named the dinosaur Velafrons (VEL-ah-frahnz). The name is a mix of Latin and Spanish. It means “sailed forehead.” The top of the dinosaur’s head was shaped like a sail. “Finding this dinosaur is exciting for us,” says scientist Eric Lund. “It helps us learn more about hadrosaurs.”	2
Eating foods that are good for you will help you feel great. What should you eat? Experts say a healthy diet is made up of foods from these groups. Whole grains help your heart and give you energy. Try whole-grain breads and crackers, oatmeal, and plain popcorn. Fruits and vegetables help your heart, eyes, skin, and teeth. Try apples, oranges, grapes, carrots, broccoli, and peppers. Dairy foods build strong bones and teeth. Try low-fat milk, yogurt, and cheese. Meat and beans build strong muscles. Try fish, chicken, kidney beans, lima beans, and nuts.	2
President George W. Bush sits at his desk in the Oval Office. That is a room in the White House. Americans vote for a president every four years. George W. Bush is our president today. He has held the job for eight years. After his first four years, he was elected again. He cannot be elected for a third time. That is because the law says that a president cannot serve more than twice. The president lives in the White House. The White House is in Washington, D.C. That is the capital of the United States.	2
November 4 is Election Day. On that day, Americans will vote for the person to be the country’s top leader. They will elect, or choose, the next president of the United States. John McCain and Barack Obama are running for president. Learn more about them below. Family: He is married to Cindy McCain. They have four sons and three daughters. Fun Facts: John McCain has many pets—three parakeets, two dogs, two turtles, a cat, a ferret, and 13 fish. He loves watching sports. His favorites are basketball, football, and baseball. Family: He is married to Michelle Obama. They have two daughters. Fun Facts: Barack Obama is left-handed. He loves hot sauce. His favorite meal to cook is chili. He exercises every morning. He likes to jog and play basketball.	2
Lunch is a special treat at Fisher Hill School in Orange, Massachusetts. The fruits and vegetables are always fresh picked. They come from a nearby farm. “I like the apples. They are juicy,” says Alyssa Rousseau, age 8. More than 8,000 schools across the country serve food from nearby farms. The schools are taking part in the National Farm to School Program. More and more schools are beginning to take part in the program. That means more students can enjoy farm-fresh foods!	2
You hear a loud siren. Cars move over as a fire truck speeds down the street. Firefighters are on their way to a fire. Read more about firefighters. They put out fires in a burn building. That is a special building that is set on fire and used for training. It helps firefighters get ready for real-life fires. Some firefighters stay overnight at the fire station. They sleep in beds called bunks. When the alarm sounds, firefighters must hurry to the fire truck. Sometimes they slide down a fire pole to get to the truck faster. Would you want to be a firefighter? Why or why not?	2
Hooray for Mary Ann Hoberman! She was recently chosen to be the Children’s Poet Laureate (LOR-ee-eht). A poet laureate is someone who is honored for his or her poetry. Hoberman has written more than 45 books of poetry for children. A group called the Poetry Foundation gave Hoberman the honor. She will hold the title for two years. During that time, she will try to encourage kids to celebrate poetry. “I want to make sure that poetry is fun,” says Hoberman. “It’s wonderful fun to play with language and enjoy language. I consider that my mission.” Most of Hoberman’s poems rhyme. In a rhyming poem, the same sounds of two or more words repeat. The words that rhyme are often at the end of the line. The Folk Who Live in Backward Town The folk who live in Backward Town Are inside out and upside down. They wear their hats inside their heads And go to sleep beneath their beds. They only eat the apple peeling And take their walks across the ceiling. A haiku (HIGH-koo) is a poem with three lines that do not rhyme. The first line has five syllables. The second line has seven syllables. The third line has five syllables. In a shape poem, the lines form a pattern. The pattern relates to the subject of the poem.	2
During the fall, some animals migrate. They move from one place to another place. Some go by land, others by air, and some by water. Caribou travel in groups called herds. One large herd lives in Alaska in the spring. They migrate south in the fall when the weather gets colder. They go to Canada. The winter is warmer there, and they can find food more easily. Many humpback whales go to the Gulf of Alaska in the summer to eat. The whales migrate south in the fall to warmer water near Hawaii. They go there to have their babies. Monarch butterflies migrate in the fall when the weather gets cool. They go to warmer places to rest for the winter. They start their trip in the United States and Canada. Most fly south to Mexico. In the spring, they return north.	2
Put on your party hats! February 12 is the 200th anniversary of Abraham Lincoln’s birth. He was the 16th president of our country. A big birthday event takes place on February 12 at the Lincoln Memorial. A memorial is something that keeps a memory alive. The Lincoln Memorial is a building in Washington, D.C., that honors Lincoln. There, Americans will gather to hear speeches about Lincoln. Events honoring Lincoln’s birthday actually began a year ago. A giant birthday party was held at the Lincoln Museum in Kentucky. That is the state where Lincoln was born. Since then, many other events have taken place across the United States. They have included poetry readings, plays, dances, and tours of places where Lincoln lived. Events will continue until February 2010. Why is the country having such a big celebration? It isn’t just because Lincoln was a great president, says David Early. Early is a spokesperson for the group that has been planning the celebration. “Lincoln’s story could be anybody’s story,” he explains. “He grew up poor on a farm and rose to become president of the United States.” When Lincoln was president, some people owned slaves. He worked to help end slavery. “One of the things that makes Lincoln great is that he believed everyone should be treated the same,” says Early. If Abraham Lincoln were here today, what would you ask him? Why?	2
To work properly, a helmet should be straight on your head and fit snugly. If a helmet is too loose, it can slip to one side. Study the photo below to learn the correct way to wear a helmet.	2
It’s fiesta (fee-ESS-tah) time! That is the Spanish word for party. Hispanic Heritage Month is here. It takes place from September 15 to October 15. During that time, we celebrate the Hispanic way of life. Hispanic Americans are people whose families came to the United States from Spanish-speaking countries. Spanish Speakers Many Hispanic Americans speak both Spanish and English. Hola (OH-lah) is the Spanish word for hello. What do those two words have in common? Tasty Foods What type of bread is flat and round? It is the Spanish tortilla (tor-TEE-yah). It is often filled with meat, cheese, and beans. Many people add sour cream on top. Dancing Feet Music and dance are a big part of Hispanic culture. Dancers wear brightly colored clothing. They move and spin to the beat of the music.	2
Kids can be inventors too! Follow the steps below to help you get started. (1) Identify a problem. Think about things that you need or things that could be made better. (2) Brainstorm ideas. List as many ideas as you can to solve the problem. Don’t worry if the idea seems silly at the time. Write down everything that pops into your head. (3) Find the best solution. Choose the idea that sounds as though it would solve the problem the best. You may have to try many ideas before you find one that works. (4) Create an invention and name it. The next great invention might be one of your ideas!	2
Many people like to munch on sweet, juicy apples. In fact, most Americans eat about 65 apples each year. Apples are grown on farms called orchards. An orchard has rows and rows of apple trees. The trees change during each of the four seasons of the year. Winter: During winter, apple trees rest. By winter, they have lost their leaves. Their branches are bare. Fall: Apples are ripe in the fall. That means they are fully grown. The apples are ready to be picked and eaten. Spring: In the spring, apple trees begin to bloom, or grow flowers. When the flowers fall off, small apples begin to grow. Summer: In the summer, the new apples are green. They keep growing all season.	2
At a school in Hayward, Wisconsin, students learn all of their subjects in Ojibwe (oh-JIHB-way). That is a Native American language. “The alphabet we have is different,” says teacher Michelle Haskins. The students call her Bimijiwanikwe (bih-mih-gee-WAH-nee-kway). That is an Ojibwe name. It means “flowing water.” “The letters f, l, q, r, u, v, and x don’t exist in our language,” Haskins explains. “We have long and short vowels. An e sounds like ay. We also have double vowels. An ii sounds like ee.” The school is trying to keep the Ojibwe language alive. “It is important for the students to learn,” says Haskins. “Then they can pass it on to their children and grandchildren.”	2
Fruit and vegetable gardens are popping up at schools across the country. How did they get there? Students planted them. Kids at Madison Elementary School in Redondo Beach, California, plant gardens in the fall and the spring. In October, they planted lettuce, radishes, carrots, broccoli, peas, and cauliflower. They harvested the crops in January. To harvest is to gather a crop. The vegetables were washed and served at a salad bar. Extra food was sold in the school cafeteria for lunch. Why are students learning how to grow gardens? Teachers want kids to learn healthy eating habits. Healthy foods give the body the energy it needs to grow and heal. Many kids are now trying new foods and learning they like them. Lisa Samuelson is the parent volunteer in charge of the program. She says a lot of students have told her, “I like salad. I didn’t think I liked salad!” Then those students have gone home and asked their parents to buy vegetables that they have tried at school. Samuelson’s daughter, Lucy, is one of those students. She is in second grade. “I love the garden,” she says. “I didn’t really like vegetables before we had the garden. Then we found out that gardening is cool. Now I like vegetables. My favorite is carrots.”	2
A memorial is being built to honor Martin Luther King Jr. A memorial is a statue or a place that honors a person or an event. “We started building this past fall. The memorial will be finished in 2010,” says spokesperson Rica Orszag. The King memorial will be built on the National Mall. That is a park in Washington, D.C. Memorials for some U.S. presidents are also on the National Mall. “With the King Memorial, the National Mall will now better reflect the different people that make up our country,” says Orszag. What will the King memorial look like? It will have trees, flowing water, and a 28-foot-tall stone carving of King. Quotes from some of King’s speeches will be carved into a 700-foot-long stone wall.	2
Fire officials are alarmed. Some lighters are made to look like toys. Parents who think they are toys are buying them for their Now fire officials are fighting back. They want to stop the sale of those lighters. This year, Maine became the first state to pass a law to stop the sale of the lighters. Then Tennessee passed a law. Fire officials in Oregon are working to do the same. “Lighters are tools, not toys,” says Richard Hoover. He is a spokesperson for the Oregon state fire marshal. “A dangerous tool should not look like a toy.” This guitar and the frog (above) are lighters. They are tools for adults, not toys for kids.	2
The United States Mint is joining the party! The Mint plans to make four new pennies in honor of Lincoln’s life. The heads side will still show a picture of Lincoln. The tails side will have four new designs. Each will show a different part of Lincoln’s life—from his birth in a log cabin to when he became president. Check your pennies for the new designs! They will be issued every three months in 2009.	2

Some ladybugs are missing! Scientists are asking kids across the country to help find them. The missing ladybugs include the nine-spotted ladybug. It was once common in the Northeast, but it has not been seen lately. The study is called the Lost Ladybug Project. Scientists need kids to search for ladybugs, take photos, and send in the photos. The scientists hope that will help them learn why some types of ladybugs are disappearing. To learn more, visit www.weeklyreader.com/links.	2
Coins are made at U.S. Mint offices. A mint is a place that makes coins. Coin-making is called minting. Follow the steps below to learn how a sheet of metal becomes a pile of new coins. (1) Large sheets of metal go through a machine that punches out circle shapes called blanks. The blanks are heated to make them soft. Then they are put in machines where they are washed, dried, and polished. (2) The blanks go through another machine that raises a tiny rim around the edge on each side. The rim protects the coin’s design. It also makes the coins easier to stack on top of one another. (3) The blanks go through a coining press. It presses both sides of each blank with pictures, words, and numbers. (4) Workers check the design on each coin. A machine called a coin sizer makes sure each coin is the right shape. If a coin is not perfect, it does not leave the U.S. Mint. (5) A counting machine drops the coins into large cloth bags. The bags are taken to banks, where people get the shiny, new coins!	2
Your tooth starts to wiggle. A few days later, it falls out! You have a space in your mouth where your tooth once was. Don’t worry, though—you are not alone! All kids lose their baby teeth to make room for their adult teeth. Your baby teeth probably grew in when you were about 6 to 10 months old. By age 3, most kids have a total of 20 baby teeth. Those teeth are also called primary teeth. Primary means first. Baby teeth begin to fall out one at a time when kids are about 6 years old. Why? Adult teeth are growing and pushing them out of the way. Most kids have lost all their baby teeth by the time they are 12 or 13 years old. They now have adult teeth. Those teeth are also called permanent teeth. Permanent means lasting. When people are between 17 and 21 years old, four more teeth grow in. They are called wisdom teeth. They are the last teeth in the back of the mouth. Adults have 32 teeth.	2
Meet Barack Obama—the 44th president of the United States. He is the first African American to become our president. Obama was elected last November. This month, he will begin a four-year term as president. The president has an important job. He is the leader of the armed forces. He helps make our country’s laws. He also works with the leaders of other countries. Obama and his wife, Michelle, have two daughters. Their names are Malia, age 10, and Sasha, age 7. They will all live in the White House for the next four years. It has been home to every president except George Washington. The White House has 132 rooms and 35 bathrooms! One room is called the Oval Office. That is where the president works. For fun, the White House has a tennis court, a jogging track, a swimming pool, a movie theater, and a bowling lane. Would you want to be president of the United States? Why or why not?	2
Read each clue below. Then write the number of the clue next to the symbol it describes. 1. You can call me Lady Liberty. 2. I am a living symbol of our country. 3. My nickname is Old Glory. 4. I may be broken, but I am still beautiful. If you could choose a new American symbol, what would it be? Why?	2
Barack Obama is the first African American to be elected president of the United States. He took office on January 20. Obama was born on August 4, 1961, in Hawaii. He went to Harvard Law School and became a lawyer. In 2004, he was elected to be a U.S. senator. Now he is the leader of our country. After Obama was elected president, he gave a speech. He said, “America, we have come so far. We have seen so much. But there is so much more to do.”	2
So much traffic is zipping around Earth’s orbit. An orbit is a path a space object travels around another object. Scientists have to keep an eye on all that traffic to make sure it flows smoothly. People have sent hundreds of satellites into Earth’s orbit. A satellite is an object that orbits a planet. Some travel as close as 100 miles above Earth. Others are thousands of miles away. The satellites have different jobs. Some track the weather. Others send signals to radios, televisions, cell phones, and computers. The Hubble Space Telescope is a well-known satellite. It was launched into space in 1990. It is in orbit 380 miles above Earth. Hubble takes photos of our solar system and faraway galaxies. A galaxy is a huge group of stars, dust, and gas. Over the years, Hubble has taught scientists a lot about space. The International Space Station is a special type of satellite. It is a giant research lab in space where astronauts live and work. The station is in orbit 220 miles above Earth. Work on the space station began in 1998. It is expected to be finished in 2010. At that time, it will be about the size of a five-bedroom house.	2
More animals live in cold waters near the South Pole than people once thought. Scientists recently found more than 1,000 types of ocean animals around a group of Antarctic islands! Until now, most people believed cold waters didn’t contain as much life as warmer waters. How did scientists make the discovery? They wore scuba gear and dived into the freezing waters. They also used nets to catch marine animals nearly a mile down in the water. “This is the first time scientists have managed to make a list of all the animal types living at a place near the South Pole,” says scientist David Barnes.	2
What begins with the words “We the people”? It is the Constitution of the United States. That is a written plan. It tells the laws, or rules, of our country. The Constitution is 221 years old. It was signed on September 17, 1787. At that time, the United States was a new country. It was made up of only 13 states. A group of leaders wanted to make the country better. That is why they worked together to write the Constitution.	2
January 20 is Inauguration (in-awgyuh-RAY-shuhn) Day. On that day, a special ceremony will take place at the U.S. Capitol. That is a building in Washington, D.C., where our country’s leaders work. There, Barack Obama will take the oath of office. An oath is a promise. The president promises to lead our country and protect our laws. After taking the oath, Obama will give a speech. He will tell Americans his plans for the country’s future. Then it is time to celebrate! The president will watch a parade of marching bands and floats. Later, the president will attend parties.	2
Grab your beach towel, sunglasses, and sunscreen! Summer is just around the corner. It starts on June 21. For most kids, that means more time to play outside and have fun. Experts say that more injuries occur during the summer months. Follow these tips to make sure you stay safe while enjoying the season. Many kids will spend hours playing outside in the summer sun. Be careful, though. The sun’s harmful rays can cause damage to your skin and eyes. If you are out in the sun, be sure to wear sunscreen. It should have a sun protection factor (SPF) of 15 or higher, say experts. Make sure you rub it in everywhere your skin is showing. You should also wear a hat and sunglasses that protect against the sun’s harmful rays. Better yet, play in the shade! You can beat the heat by splashing in a pool. Just make sure you follow water-safety rules. Always swim with a grown-up watching you. You should also swim with a buddy. If you don’t know how to swim, you can take lessons. Biking and in-line skating are good ways to exercise. To stay wheel safe, always wear a helmet. It protects your head and brain if you fall. If you are in-line skating, also wear wrist guards, elbow pads, and kneepads.	2
The National Weather Service can usually predict when and where a tornado will strike. Tornado warnings let people know to get to safety. The warnings are usually given on radio and television stations. Some places have loud sirens to warn people. If a tornado warning is given, experts say to do the following:	2
Tropical rain forests are in danger. For years, people have been cutting down trees to make room for farms and roads. Many plants and animals are in danger of becoming extinct, or completely gone. “When rain forests are cut down, animals lose their homes,” says Kerry Zobor. She works at the World Wildlife Fund. “More carbon dioxide fills the air. Scientists think that makes Earth get warmer. If it gets too hot, it could cause many animals to go extinct.” The World Wildlife Fund is a group working to protect animals and habitats. A habitat is a place in nature where an animal or a plant lives. “We are working every day to help save rain forests around the world,” says Zobor.	2
Bats in the northeastern United States are in trouble. Thousands of bats are becoming sick and dying. They have “white-nose syndrome.” The disease is named after a white fungus that some bats are getting on their noses. A fungus is a type of plant life that can cause disease in animals. Scientists are working to find out why the bats are getting sick. They want to solve the mystery quickly. With fewer bats, there will be more insects. That could be a big problem for people, say scientists.	2
Many holidays take place toward the end of the year. People often use lights as part of the celebrations. Christmas is a Christian holiday. It is celebrated each year on December 25. People decorate evergreen trees with lights. Some people also hang lights on the outside of their homes. Diwali, also called Deepavali, is a Hindu holiday. It lasts for five days. The holiday is known as a festival of lights. People decorate their homes with lights, oil lamps, and candles. Hanukkah is a Jewish holiday. It is also called a festival of lights. The holiday is celebrated for eight days. Each night, people light colorful candles in holders called menorahs. Kwanzaa is an African American celebration of African culture. It lasts a week. People light candles in holders called kinaras. The candles are black, green, and red. Las Posadas is a Mexican holiday. It is celebrated for nine days and ends on Christmas. Each night, people hold candles and sing while they walk through their neighborhoods. Ramadan is a Muslim holiday that lasts a month. People decorate their homes with special lanterns. They are usually made of colorful glass. Children may also carry lanterns in the street.	2
Welcome to a tropical rain forest! It is a warm, rainy place with many tall trees. More than half of the world’s species, or types, of plants and animals are found here. A tropical rain forest has four layers. From top to bottom, the forest is full of life. You can thank tropical rain forests for keeping the air clean. Trees help to recycle Earth’s air. The leaves take in a gas called carbon dioxide. Too much carbon dioxide in the air is harmful to people. The leaves then give off a gas called oxygen. People need oxygen to stay alive. What do lemons, chocolate, and cashew nuts have in common? They are foods that first came from tropical rain forests. Hundred dreds of foods grow there today. Many medicines are made from rain forest plants. Today, scientists are studying the plants to find new medicines to cure diseases.	2
You can’t see them, but millions of pieces of junk are flying around Earth. The junk is called debris (deh-BREE). It includes parts of old satellites. The largest piece of debris is part of a rocket about the size of a car. The tiniest pieces are flecks of paint. The debris can damage working satellites. It can also hit old satellites and break them apart. That creates more space trash. Scientists are tracking the pieces of debris in space. However, that is not easy. “All working satellites and debris are moving very fast, and in all different directions,” says NASA scientist Nicholas Johnson. NASA is the U.S. space agency. Can scientists solve the space junk problem? “Countries around the world have agreed to reduce the amount of new space junk,” says Johnson. “We are working on getting rid of the old stuff, but we haven’t figured out how yet. The good news is that we caught this before it started to get out of hand.”	2
A symbol is an object or sign that stands for something else. Read about some famous U.S. symbols that stand for our freedom. The Statue of Liberty is located on an island in New York Harbor. The statue is made of copper. That is one of the metals used to make the penny. The Statue of Liberty is also known as “Lady Liberty.” The Liberty Bell hangs in a museum in Pennsylvania. Soon after the bell was made, it cracked. People tried to fix the bell, but it cracked again. Many people visit the bell to see the crack that made it famous. The bald eagle is our national bird. It is a living symbol of our country. The bald eagle is a symbol of strength and freedom. The bird is not actually bald. Long ago, the word bald meant “white.” This red, white, and blue symbol is well-known. It is the American flag. The 50 stars stand for the 50 states. The 13 stripes stand for the 13 original colonies. The flag is also known as “Old Glory.”	2
Our trash is piling up. Each American throws away an average of about 4½ pounds every day. That adds up to more than 1,600 pounds of trash per person every year! The trash includes bottles, cans, boxes, paper, tires, and much more. Much of it ends up in landfills. Those are places where people dump trash. April 22 is Earth Day. The day reminds people to takecare of Earth. People can help by following the three R’s—reduce, reuse, and recycle. You can reduce the amount of trash you throw away. Reduce means “to make less.” Here are some ways to make less trash: You can recycle. When something is recycled, it is made into something new. Here are some items that can be taken to a recycling center. You can try to reuse things before you throw them in the trash. Reuse means “to use again.” Here are some examples:	2
Smile! New studies show that people who have healthy teeth and gums also have healthy hearts. “That’s why brushing and flossing your teeth is so important. It removes the bacteria that can cause problems in other places in your body,” says Dr. Sally Cram. She is a spokesperson for the American Dental Association. (1) Brush your teeth twice a day with toothpaste. Replace your toothbrush every three to four months. (2) Floss gently once a day. Dental floss is thread that cleans between your teeth. (4) Eat foods that are good for you. Those foods include fresh fruits and vegetables.	2
Tornado season has started in the United States. A tornado is a powerful, spinning wind. It is also known as a twister. Most tornadoes last fewer than 15 minutes. During that time, a twister can travel across a large area of land and destroy everything in its path. The strong winds in some tornadoes reach speeds of up to 300 miles per hour. Those winds can toss cars and other objects high into the air. Tornadoes can happen any time of the year. However, they are most common from March through July. Most tornadoes start as thunderstorms. During those storms, heavy rain and lightning are common. Large hail, or ball-shaped pieces of ice, may also fall. Large thunderstorm clouds appear in the sky. The clouds become dark. Thunder can be heard. Warm and cold air meet. Air rises from the ground to the clouds. If the rising air starts to spin, a funnel-shaped cloud can form. The funnel-shaped cloud spins faster. When the bottom of the cloud touches the ground, it becomes a tornado.	2
A baby humpback whale is called a calf. It grunts and squeals. Why does it make those sounds? Scientists have learned that the calf sends messages to its mother. Until now, most scientists thought humpback whale calves did not make any sounds. Now the scientists are trying to find out what the sounds mean.	2
China is a country in Asia. Study the maps to learn more. Then answer the questions below. 1. What is the capital of China? 2. What are the names of two rivers in China? 3. Which ocean borders China on the east?	2
Weekly Reader spoke with Mary Ann Hoberman to learn more about her. Here are her answers to our questions. What do you like most about poetry? I love playing with language. I love rhyme, rhythm, and repetition. It is something that is really a great joy. What are your favorite topics to write about? Animals, families, nature, games, and then just kinds of things where I play with words. I love to play with words, and words that have different meanings. What advice would you give kids about writing poetry? Read, read, read. Find poems that you love, and memorize them. Just have fun making things up in your head and writing them down.	2
Our world has many famous landmarks. A landmark is a building or place that is special to an area. Some landmarks are built by people. Other landmarks are things in nature, such as a volcano or a waterfall. In this issue, you will learn about six famous landmarks built by people. Mount Rushmore is a rock sculpture. It was carved into a mountain from 1927 to 1941. The sculpture shows the faces of four presidents—George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, Theodore Roosevelt, and Abraham Lincoln. Each face is as tall as a six-story building. Machu Picchu (MAH-choo PEE-choo) was once a city located high in the Andes Mountains in Peru. Its name means “old peak.” The city was built nearly 600 years ago. The remains of about 200 stone buildings are found there. They include palaces, temples, and homes. The Great Sphinx is a huge statue. It has the head of a person and the body of a lion. It was built more than 4,000 years ago. No one knows for sure why it was built. Some say it honors an ancient king. The Leaning Tower of Pisa is a bell tower. It was built on soft soil. That caused the tower to tilt to one side soon after workers began building it more than 800 years ago. Visitors can climb about 300 steps inside to see a great view of the city. The Great Wall of China is the longest structure ever built. It twists and turns through China for about 4,000 miles. The wall was built to keep out invaders. Parts of the wall are more than 2,000 years old. The Sydney Opera House was built from 1957 to 1973. This performing arts center looks like a ship with sails. It is located on a piece of land inside a harbor. A harbor is a part of a body of water where ships can stay safe from storms.	2
Many kids across the United States are great artists. Some showed off their talent in a holiday greeting card contest. The theme was “Making Spirits Bright.” The winner of the contest was Wesley Kao, age 10, from California. His drawing was made into a holiday greeting card. The card is being sold at Pier 1 Imports stores across the country. Money earned from sales of the card is going to UNICEF. That is a charity. A charity is a group that helps people in need. UNICEF helps needy children throughout the world. It provides, or gives, things such as food, medicine, and clean water.	2
A big hurricane hit the United States in 2005. It was called Hurricane Katrina. That hurricane caused a lot of damage to homes and schools in New Orleans, a city in Louisiana. A new school is opening in New Orleans this fall. It is Langston Hughes Academy Charter School. John Alford is in charge of the company that is managing the school. “It is the first new public school in New Orleans since the storm”, he says. “We are going to be better than we were before the storm!”	2
Grab your raincoat and boots! Spring is here. That means warmer, rainy weather in some parts of the United States. Read the answers to some questions about wet weather. A few wet drops land on your head. It’s raining! Rain falls from clouds. Clouds are made of tiny bits of water and ice. The bits grow bigger as they join together. Some get so heavy that they fall to the ground. The ice melts if the air is warmer along the way. The raindrops reach the ground as water. Some clouds bring thunderstorms. Those are storms with heavy rain, lightning, and thunder. As lightning strikes, it heats the air around it. That causes the air to expand, or get bigger. When that happens, you hear a loud sound called thunder. When it rains, you may see a rainbow. It appears when sunlight passes through drops of water in the air. The drops break up the sunlight into seven colors: red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and violet. Why? Sunlight is always made up of those colors. They look white when they are together. The drops of water separate each color.	2
Some animals are active at night. Those animals are nocturnal. They sleep during the day. Nocturnal animals can see clearly in the dark. They often have a good sense of hearing too. Bats, owls, and flying squirrels are nocturnal. Most bats eat insects. How does a bat find an insect in the dark? The bat makes sounds. The sounds bounce off an insect in the bat’s path. The sounds return to the bat. That lets the bat know where to find the insect and how big it is. Flying squirrels live in trees. Can the squirrels really fly? No! They glide in the air. The squirrel leaps up and opens its arms and legs. Folds of skin connect its wrists to its ankles. That skin acts like wings. Owls have large eyes. How does that help? They can see better at night than most animals. An owl’s eyes don’t move. They always face forward. An owl has to turn its head to see in any other direction. Its head can turn almost all the way around!	2
Some bats are in trouble. They have an illness. Thousands of bats have died from it. The bats get a white fungus on their noses, ears, and wings. A fungus is a type of plant life that can make animals sick. Scientists do not know why the bats are getting sick. They have been trying to solve the mystery for more than a year. “We’re trying to find out what this fungus is and where it came from,” says scientist Susi von Oettingen. She works for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. “We’re trying to figure out if we can make the bats healthy again,” she says.	2
Gauri Nanda had trouble getting up in the morning. Her alarm clock would ring, and she would press the snooze button. Then she would not wake up on time. One day, Nanda had an idea. She invented an alarm clock with wheels. She named it Clocky. Now people can use Clocky to help them wake up on time. (4) As the clock moves, it beeps its alarm! That means that a person must get out of bed to find the clock. What problems do these inventions solve? Which of the inventions do you think is the most important? Why?	2
Constitution Day is September 17. That is the day our Constitution was signed. On that day, Americans will celebrate in different ways. Students will learn about the Constitution at school. In some places, kids and adults will hear people read it aloud. Some kids will sign a copy of the Constitution. How will you celebrate this important day?	2
What do people need to light their homes and drive cars? Energy! It gives power to many things we need and use. Most of the energy people use comes from coal, oil, and gas. They are called fossil fuels. Those fuels come from fossils under the ground. Fossils are the remains of plants and animals that lived long ago. Burning fossil fuels pollutes the air. The air becomes dirty. That can be harmful to people, animals, and plants. Now more people are using clean energy. Such energy does not pollute the air. Two kinds of clean energy are wind power and solar power. Solar means “from the sun.” The sun gives Earth heat and light. Some homes have solar panels on the roof. The panels collect sunlight and turn it into electricity. That is a kind of energy. It lets people do many things. For example, we use electricity to light our homes and watch television. Solar power can also be used to warm up the water in our homes. People can turn wind energy into electricity. Wind turbines are machines that spin when the wind blows. They make electricity. Wind turbines are often as tall as 20-story buildings. The blades can be more than 100 feet long. Wind turbines are grouped together in wind farms. Some wind farms have hundreds of wind turbines. The Roscoe Wind Farm in Texas has 627 turbines. They can power 230,000 homes.	2
Scientists have identified a new dinosaur. It is the smallest dinosaur yet to be found in North America. The dinosaur was smaller than a house cat. The tiny dinosaur had very sharp claws and teeth. It was a carnivore. Scientists say it most likely hunted insects and small animals. The dinosaur’s fossils were actually found almost 30 years ago. They were put in a drawer for safekeeping. A scientist took the fossils out a few years ago. He decided to study them. That led him to make the discovery.	2
Dinosaurs roamed Earth millions of years ago. Some dinosaurs were as small as chickens. Others were larger than houses. Tyrannosaurus rex was one of the biggest meat-eating dinosaurs. It had tiny arms, with two small, sharp-clawed fingers on each arm. Scientists often group dinosaurs by the food they ate. Most dinosaurs ate plants. Those dinosaurs are called herbivores. They had flat teeth. Apatosaurus was a large plant-eating dinosaur. It used to be called Brontosaurus. It had a very long neck. Its tail was even longer. Dinosaurs died out 65 million years ago. No people were alive during that time. Then how do we know so much about dinosaurs? People have found dinosaur fossils in the ground. Fossils are remains of plants and animals that lived long ago. Hundreds of different types of dinosaurs have been found. Experts say that there are many more yet to be discovered.	2
Our solar system is made up of the sun and eight planets. A planet is a large ball made of rock or gas. Each planet orbits, or travels around, the sun. The sun is at the center of the solar system. The sun is a star. It is a ball of hot gas. It gives off light and heat. Why does the sun look different from other stars? The sun is the star closest to Earth. Mercury is the closest planet to the sun. It is also the smallest. It has mountains and craters. Craters are holes in the ground that were made when space rocks crashed into it. Venus is the hottest planet. It is hot enough to melt a rocket ship. Venus is about the same size as Earth. Earth is our home. It is also the only planet with oceans. In fact, Earth is covered mostly with water. That is why it is called the Blue Planet. Mars is called the Red Planet. It has reddish dirt. It also has mountains, volcanoes, ice caps, and canyons. A canyon is a deep, narrow valley with steep sides. Jupiter is the largest planet. It is made of thick gases. Very strong winds blow on this planet. Saturn is the second-largest planet. It has rings around it. The rings are made of rock, dust, and ice. Uranus was the first planet to be discovered using a telescope. It is cold and windy here. Neptune is the coldest planet because it is farthest from the sun. The planet is made of gases.	2
These African Americans made history. They did some important things. Jackie Robinson was a baseball player. He was the first African American to play on a Major League Baseball team. He played for the Brooklyn Dodgers. Robinson started in 1947 and played for 10 years. He helped the team win many games. Mae Jemison used to be an astronaut. In 1992, she became the first African American woman to go into space. She flew on the space shuttle Endeavour. She was in space for eight days. Today, Jemison owns her own company. It is called the Jemison Group. Marian Anderson was a singer. In 1955, she became the first African American to sing a solo at the Metropolitan Opera. That is an opera house in New York City. A solo is sung by one person alone. Oprah Winfrey was the first African American woman to host her own daytime television show. It is called The Oprah Winfrey Show. The show started in 1986 and became very popular. Today, Oprah also has her own magazine. It is called O, The Oprah Magazine. Which of these people would you most like to meet? Why?	2
Some firefighters in Kansas are learning a new way to put out fires. They are using a mixture of foam, water, and air. Before now, they used plain water. The white foam comes out of a fire hose. “It looks like whipped cream,” says Jeff Johnson. He is a fire chief. “The foam mixture puts out fires faster,” says Johnson. How? It covers the fire and lowers the temperature. The foam absorbs, or takes in, heat.	2
How can you be ready in case of a fire at home? Learn safety tips and practice! Here are four safety tips you should know. Smoke alarms save lives. Have an alarm inside and outside each bedroom. You should also have a smoke alarm on every level of the home. Push the test button at least once a month. That will let you know whether the alarm is working. Choose a safe place outside where everyone will meet. Get out and stay out! Never go back inside a burning building. Why is it important to have a home fire escape plan? How might practicing it help you?	2
Many schools are growing their own food. Chatham Elementary School in Illinois is one of those schools. In September, students planted seeds in a garden. They are growing spinach, lettuce, radishes, and herbs. A group of volunteers created the school’s garden project. The group was started by Dr. Kemia Sarraf. She wants to teach kids healthy habits. “Gardens are wonderful,” says Kim Sepich, the school’s principal. “When kids plant and grow their own food, they are more likely to try it. We want kids to eat their veggies!”	2
Some pumpkins are supersized. Farmers grow them to win contests that are held each October. A pumpkin contest is held each year in California. The winner of last year’s contest was Thad Starr. He is a farmer in Oregon. His pumpkin weighed 1,528 pounds! Starr won the year before too. What is his secret? He says he uses good soil for his pumpkins. “We really pamper them,” says Starr. Pamper means “to treat with special care.”	2
A new study shows that hibernating animals are less likely to die out. Why? Earth’s weather has been changing over time. Scientists say animals that sleep or hide are able to survive the changes better. To survive is to stay alive. “Animals that sleep or hide are protected from nature,” says scientist Bill Toone. “That helps them survive.”	2
About 300 million people live in the United States. How many of those people are Hispanic American? More than 46 million! The number keeps growing. By the year 2050, experts say, nearly one of every three Americans will be Hispanic.	2
April 22 is Earth Day. That is a day for people to take action and help Earth. This year, Earth Day is 40 years old. To celebrate, 40 events will take place in cities around the world. The events were the idea of Earth Day Network. That group is trying to get more people to take care of Earth. “The main event is going to be held in Washington, D.C. People can go there to learn more about ways to help Earth,” says Sean Miller. He is the education director at Earth Day Network. Many people will take part in other Earth Day events too. Some people will clean up parks and beaches. Others will plant trees. What will you do on Earth Day?	2
Christmas is a Christian holiday. It lasts for one day. People decorate trees with ornaments and lights. Some people string lights on the outside of their homes. Diwali is a Hindu holiday. It lasts for up to five days. People light oil lamps and candles. They put them near windows and doors and outside their homes. Eid al-Fitr (EED al-FIH-tuhr) is a Muslim holiday. It lasts for one to three days. Family and friends gather together to eat a special meal. Hanukkah is a Jewish holiday. It lasts for eight days. Boys and girls play a game with a dreidel (DRAY-del). It is a spinning top with four sides. Kwanzaa is an African American holiday. It lasts for seven days. Adults give kids gifts. One of the gifts is usually a book. Las Posadas is a Latin American holiday. It lasts for nine days. It ends on Christmas. Each night, people walk through their towns. They stop at homes to sing.	2
It’s party time! People around the world celebrate the holiday in different ways. A big party is held in New York. Millions of people watch the party on television. People count down the final seconds of the old year. At midnight, a bright crystal ball drops. People cheer for the start of the new year. Many people go to parties on the beach. People wear white clothes. They watch a fireworks show. Some people put flowers into the ocean and make a wish. It is believed to be good luck if the waves take the flowers out to sea. People celebrate with their families. They each have 12 grapes ready. At midnight, they eat the grapes for good luck. Each grape stands for one month of the new year. People dress in colorful clothes. They go to parades. Marching bands play. Many people dance in the streets to the beat of the drums. Chinese New Year is a long celebration. It lasts for 15 days. This year, the holiday starts on February 14. Parades are held on the last day. Many people wear new red clothes. Kids carry lanterns. Some people wear dragon costumes and dance through the streets. The dragon is a symbol of good luck. A big fireworks show is held at midnight. It takes place over the Sydney Harbour Bridge. A harbor is a part of a body of water where ships can stay safe from storms. People also watch a parade of boats on the water. The boats are decorated with lights. What do the celebrations have in common? How are they different?	2
A brother and sister team are helping soldiers. Brittany Bergquist is 19 years old, and her brother, Robbie, is 17. They started a program in 2004 called Cell Phones for Soldiers. (2) The phones are sold and recycled. That means the phones are made into something new. (4) The cards are sent to soldiers all over the world. The soldiers can use the cards to call home for free. “It is important to donate phones so that the troops are able to call home and know that their families are safe,” says Brittany. To donate is to give.	2
Hispanic Heritage Month is here! It is from September 15 to October 15. That is a time to learn about Hispanic culture. Culture is the way of life of a group of people. Hispanic Americans live in the United States. They or their families came from countries where people speak Spanish. Everyone can celebrate this special month. Read more to learn how you can join in the fun! Music is a big part of Hispanic culture. Some people wear colorful clothes when they dance. The tortilla (tor-TEE-yah) is a type of flat bread. It is used in many foods. One of those foods is the taco. Kids play with piñatas (pin-YAH-tuhss). Those toys are filled with treats. Kids try to break the piñatas with sticks and rush to get the treats that fall out.	2
Lava is flowing out of a volcano in Hawaii. The volcano is named Kilauea (kee-lah-WAY-ah). It is one of the world’s most active volcanoes. It has been erupting for more than 25 years! Scientists are keeping a close watch on Kilauea. They want to make sure people living nearby are safe. The lava from Kilauea goes into the Pacific Ocean. The lava cools. Then, it hardens into rock. The rock forms new land over time. Many people visit Kilauea each year. “This is one of the few places in the world where you can get really close to an actively erupting volcano,” says scientist Jim Kauahikaua (koh-wah-hee-KOH-wah). “It’s really cool.”	2
Q: Where was the Constitution signed? A: At the bottom!	2
Shaun White slides down a snowy hill on a long, flat board. He jumps and twists through the air. He is a snowboarder. He started when he was 6 years old. Now he is 23. He is one of the best snowboarders in the world. White is ready for the Olympic Winter Games. They will be held in Canada from February 12 to 28. Athletes from around the world will be there. An athlete is a person who plays a sport. The athletes will try to win medals. A gold medal is the top prize. The Winter Games are fast and exciting. All the sports are played on snow or ice. Read about some of those sports. Figure skaters spin, jump, and dance across the ice. They skate to music. Judges give the skaters points for how well they skate. Ice hockey is a team sport. It is played on ice. Players use long, curved sticks to hit a puck. A puck is a hard disk made of rubber. A player scores a goal if the puck goes into the net. Alpine ski racers go down big hills. They move fast. They can reach speeds of up to 80 miles an hour. That is faster than a car on a highway! Racers must pass through gates as they go. The fastest racer wins. Are the Olympic Winter Games important? Why or why not?	2
Barack Obama is the president of the United States. He is the first African American to hold that job. Obama has had a busy first year as president. What does he do? He works to make laws to help people. He also meets with world leaders. They talk about problems in the world and try to solve them. When Obama is not working, he spends time with his family. His wife is Michelle Obama. They have two girls. Malia is 11 years old, and Sasha is 8. The family has a dog named Bo. Would you want to be president? Why or why not?	2
Which animal was a big part of Native American life long ago? The horse, of course! That is what a new museum exhibit is about. An exhibit is a show. The new exhibit is called A Song for the Horse Nation. It will have paintings, photos, and other objects showing horses and Native American life. The exhibit opens in New York on November 14. Then it will go to Washington, D.C.	2
Pack your bags! It’s time to take a road trip. Our country has many natural landmarks. Those are places in nature that are well-known. Have a blast at Old Faithful! That is a geyser in Wyoming. A geyser is a spring that shoots steam and hot water into the air. Old Faithful erupts every 35 to 120 minutes. The water can reach up to 184 feet high. The blast lasts for only a few minutes. During that time, thousands of gallons of water shoot up in the air. Niagara Falls is an amazing sight. It is made up of two waterfalls. Those are places in a river or stream where water drops a long way. The waterfalls are on the Niagara River. They are shared by New York and Ontario, Canada. The two waterfalls are about 170 to 180 feet high. If they were side-by-side, they would be more than 3,000 feet wide. The Grand Canyon rocks! A canyon is a deep, narrow valley with high cliffs on each side. It is often carved over time by a fast-moving river. The Grand Canyon is in Arizona. It was carved by the Colorado River millions of years ago. The river continues to flow through it today and wear away the rock. Where are some of the world’s tallest trees? They are in Redwood National Park in California. The trees are called redwoods. They can grow more than 300 feet tall. Their trunks can be up to 20 feet wide. Redwood trees live for a long time. Some are more than 2,000 years old. Which of these natural landmarks would you most like to visit? Why?	2
The Supreme Court is the highest court in our country. Nine justices decide what laws mean and whether the laws obey the Constitution. To obey is to follow a rule.	2
“Polar bears need ice to find seals to eat,” says Bruce Woods. He is a spokesperson for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. “Scientists are working to protect polar bears and their dens,” he says. A den is a place where polar bears raise their cubs.	2
The Constitution is a set of laws for our country. A law is a rule. Our country had many different rules. People wanted to have one set of rules. A group of leaders worked together to write the Constitution. This painting is an artist’s idea of what that meeting looked like. The leaders met in Independence Hall. That is a famous building in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The Constitution was written in 1787. That was more than 200 years ago! The Constitution has more than 4,000 words. A quill (KWIL) was used to write those words. A quill is a pen made from a feather. It is dipped in ink.	2
Some athletes are not able to use their arms or legs well. Others cannot see well. Those athletes can compete in the Paralympic Games. This year, they take place March 12 to 21. Some athletes who ski cannot stand. They sit in seats attached to skis. People who have one leg use one ski. Wheelchair curling is a team sport. Players use their hands or sticks to try to get a stone closest to a target. Athletes play ice sledge hockey. Players sit on sleds called sledges. Two blades under each sledge let players glide on the ice.	2
Some ants live in special plants known as ant plants. Those plants have hollow parts where the ants can live. Something that is hollow has empty space inside. The ants help the plants by killing insects that eat the plants. Scientists recently found that some ants can harm plants. The ants attack plants that do not have hollow parts. The ants dig tunnels in the plants to make nests. Why? Scientists say that when the ants run out of space in ant plants, they make room in other plants. This ant and plant get along well. The ant lives inside the plant’s hollow parts. The ant kills insects that eat the plant.	2
How can you celebrate National Poetry Month? Take part in Poem In Your Pocket Day! It takes place on April 29. Choose a poem you love, and put it in your pocket. You can also write your own poem. Carry your poem all day. Read it and share it with others. “Poem In Your Pocket Day started in New York City,” says Tree Swenson. She is the head of the Academy of American Poets. “Now people all over the country are tucking poems in their pockets to read to others. Poems can be funny, sad, or surprising. What’s important is that you choose the poem that you like best.”	2
What is the largest meat eater on land? The polar bear! It lives in the Arctic. That is a cold, windy area near the North Pole. Snow and ice cover the ground for most of the year. A polar bear is a kind of bear. It has thick white fur. It can weigh up to 1,700 pounds. Standing on its back legs, it can be more than 10 feet tall. When a polar bear travels, it walks and runs on all fours. It can walk on its back legs for a short amount of time. Polar bears can also swim. They paddle using their front paws. Their back legs help them steer. A polar bear eats mostly meat. Seal is its favorite food. A polar bear can smell a seal that is miles away. The bear’s white fur helps it blend in with the snow and ice. That makes it easier for the polar bear to sneak up on a seal. A polar bear has two layers of fur. The bottom layer of fur is thick. The top layer is long and shiny. The fur is oily and keeps out water so the bear stays dry and warm. A polar bear also has blubber under its skin. Blubber is a thick layer of fat. The fat keeps the bear warm when it swims in the icy water.	2
The sound of drums fills the air. People start to sing and dance. A powwow has begun. A powwow is a festival. It celebrates Native American life. People sing songs in Native American languages. Some of the songs are old. Other songs are new. People sing to the beat of a drum. Dancers move to the beat. The drum is an important part of the powwow. Dancers wear special clothes at a powwow. The clothes are made by hand. As the dancers get older, they add pieces to the clothes. Some of the pieces are gifts from family and friends. People sell arts and crafts at some powwows. The artists make each item by hand. The arts and crafts often include beadwork, baskets, and pottery. Fry bread is often found at powwows. The bread is sometimes used to make special tacos. People put meat, lettuce, tomatoes, cheese, and hot peppers on top of the bread. Then they roll it up and eat it.	2
February 15 is Presidents’ Day. Do you know why we honor George Washington and Abraham Lincoln on that day? Both presidents were born in February. George Washington was our first president. He was born in Virginia on February 22, 1732. He was president from 1789 to 1797. (1) When he was a boy, his favorite subject was math. 1+1 = 2 3x7 = 21 (2) He started writing in a journal at age 16. He had good handwriting. He wrote about what he did each day. (4) He had many dogs and horses. He also had a parrot named Polly. (5) At the age of 22, he started to lose his teeth. When he became president, he had only one tooth left. He wore false teeth. (6) He never lived in the White House. Why? It had not been built yet. Work on the White House was started in 1792. It was finished in 1800. Abraham Lincoln was our 16th president. He was born in Kentucky on February 12, 1809. He was president from 1861 to 1865. (1) When he was a boy, he loved to read. One of his favorite books was about the life of George Washington. (2) He was known for being honest. People often called him “Honest Abe.” (4) He had goats, dogs, and a cat named Tabby. Tabby was the first cat to live in the White House. (5) He was the tallest president. He was 6 feet 4 inches tall. (6) He was the first president to have a beard. He grew it after getting a letter from a little girl named Grace. She told him that his face was thin. She said he would look better with a beard.	2
Fall is here. It’s time to pick pumpkins. Read the steps to learn the life cycle of a pumpkin. Pumpkins begin as seeds. The seeds are planted in the ground in May and June. After about 10 days, a sprout grows. A sprout is a tiny plant. The sprout grows into a vine. A vine is a long stem. It can grow more than 20 feet long! Soon, yellow flowers called blossoms grow. At the bottom of some blossoms is a tiny pumpkin. Tiny green pumpkins start to grow. They grow bigger and bigger. By October, it’s time to pick big, orange pumpkins. The seeds inside can be used to grow more pumpkins.	2
Mount Rushmore is a mountain in South Dakota. The faces of four U.S. presidents are carved on it. Now a special model is being made of Mount Rushmore. What will make the model so special? It will be shown on a computer in 3-D! That makes pictures look more like the real object, instead of looking flat. People are making the 3-D model for an important reason. If Mount Rushmore is ever damaged, it will need to be fixed. The 3-D model will show people what the carving looked like. Mount Rushmore shows the faces of George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, Theodore Roosevelt, and Abraham Lincoln. Each face is as tall as a six-story building! Mount Rushmore is a famous landmark. A landmark is a building or place that is special to an area. Americans want to make sure that Mount Rushmore will be here for a long time.	2
Rain forests are in trouble. They are disappearing. For many years, people have been cutting down trees to make room for farms and roads. Many groups are working to save rain forests. The forests are home to half the world’s plant and animal species, or types. Many of those species are in danger of dying out. “We have lost almost all of our world’s tropical rain forests,” says Ashley Schaeffer. She is a spokesperson for the Rainforest Action Network. That group is working to protect rain forests. “Unless we take action now, they will all be gone,” she says. “We are working with large companies to get them to stop cutting down trees.” Should people protect rain forests? Why or why not?	2
Frogs are disappearing around the world. The frogs are getting a skin fungus. A fungus is a type of plant life that can make animals sick. The disease is spreading. Many frogs are dying. Scientists are trying to figure out how to save the frogs. So far, no one has found a cure for the fungus.	2
Kids can help keep track of monarchs. They can put tags on them. The tags are tiny stickers. Each tag has a number on it. The number shows when and where each monarch was found. Scientists look for monarchs with the tags. They want to keep track of them. Why? The number of monarchs is getting smaller. People are cutting down plants and trees where the butterflies live. “We want to learn about monarchs so we can save them,” says scientist Chip Taylor. You can help put tags on monarchs. Find out more at monarchwatch.org.	2
Can you imagine a pizza box that turns into serving plates? a fan without spinning blades? a garden growing on a wall? Well, get ready to learn about those great inventions! Inventions are new things. They can solve problems and make life easier. The Green Box is a pizza box that can be reused. Reuse means “to use again.” That makes less trash. The top half of the box divides into four plates. People don’t need paper plates. The bottom of the box folds in half and can be used to hold leftovers. A man named William Walsh invented the Green Box. His friends often ate pizza, but they never used plates. One day, a friend spilled hot cheese on his shirt. Walsh tore off a piece of the box and gave it to him to use as a plate. What a good idea! The electric fan was invented more than 120 years ago. It has blades that spin and move the air. A company called Dyson has invented a new type of fan. It is called the Air Multiplier. The new fan does not have blades. It is safer to use and can be easily cleaned. How does a fan without blades move air? It has a motor that pulls air in through holes in the bottom of the fan. The air is pushed out over a circle-shaped ramp. It lets out a stream of air. Cool! Blanc’s gardens are unusual. The plants do not grow in soil. Their roots are attached to a type of cloth called felt. Water is pumped through the garden to keep plants healthy.	2
Let’s celebrate the season of spring with poetry! Spring is a time when life begins again. Flowers bloom. Many baby animals are born. Which poem is your favorite? In a rhyming poem, the same sounds of two or more words repeat. The words that rhyme are often at the ends of lines. The poem below is a quatrain. It has four lines in each stanza. A stanza is a grouping of lines. In a quatrain, the last words in lines two and four must rhyme. Can you find the rhyming words below? They’ve come back to build nests, And sunbathe on rocks, And raise little ducklings To add to their flocks. —Marie E. Cecchini In an acrostic poem, each line describes the topic word. Each letter of the word starts a new line. This poem about a flower uses the letters in the word flower to begin each line. A haiku (HIGH-koo) is a type of poem from Japan. It is usually about nature. A haiku has three lines. The first line has five syllables. The second line has seven syllables. The third line has five syllables. The Colt Frisky—full of pep. Galloping through the green grass. Always moving. Free. —Connie Unsworth	2
Mark your calendars! Three U.S. holidays take place during the next few months. Memorial Day is May 31. Memorial Day honors Americans who died fighting in wars. Some people place flowers or flags on the graves of those men and women. Flag Day is June 14. Americans honor our country’s flag on this holiday. People fly the U.S. flag outside of homes and businesses. Independence Day is July 4. Independence Day is also called the Fourth of July. This holiday celebrates the birthday of our country. Many people go to fireworks shows.	2
Hurricane season is here! The season lasts from June to November. A hurricane is a storm that brings heavy rain and strong winds. It can harm trees and homes. A hurricane begins over warm ocean water. Winds make the storm spin around and around. The center of the storm is called the eye. It is calm there. Hurricanes often hit places near the coast. A coast is land next to the ocean. A hurricane can cause big ocean waves. The waves are called a storm surge. That can cause flooding. How can you get ready for a hurricane? You can pack a safety kit with water, a radio, a flashlight, batteries, blankets, and food. What other things might you need to do to stay safe during a hurricane? Why?	2
Many people help others during the holidays. One way to help is to donate food. The food helps feed hungry people. Why is food important? “If you don’t have enough to eat, you can’t learn in school,” says Ross Fraser. “It’s hard to sleep. You don’t feel good.” Fraser is a spokesperson for a charity called Feeding America. A charity is a group that helps people in need. Every week, Feeding America gives food to 4 million people.	2
Teeth are very important. Your teeth help you bite and chew your food. They help you speak. Teeth also give you a beautiful smile. In fact, it would be hard to say the word smile without your teeth. Dentists say to brush at least twice a day. Use a small toothbrush with soft bristles. Put a pea-sized amount of toothpaste on the brush. Then brush for two to three minutes. You can hum a song to time yourself. Visit a dentist twice a year to get your teeth cleaned. The dentist will make sure your teeth are healthy. Dental floss cleans between your teeth. Dentists say to use floss once a day. If you need help, ask an adult. Healthy foods are good for your teeth. Those foods include milk, cheese, fresh fruits, and vegetables. Brushing and flossing removes plaque (PLAK) from your teeth. Plaque is a sticky layer of germs. The germs can attack your teeth and gums. Gums are the pink areas around the teeth.	2
Veterans Day is November 11. It is a time to honor brave Americans. To honor is to show great respect. Veterans are men and women who have served in the armed forces. The armed forces are five groups that keep our country safe. They are the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps (KOHR), and Coast Guard. About 25 million veterans live in our country today. Many of those people have fought in wars. They have also served in times of peace. Many cities have parades on Veterans Day. Bands play music and march down the streets. Veterans march too. People wave American flags. The flag is a symbol of our freedom. A symbol is an object or a sign that stands for something else. What other symbols of our country can you name?	2
Watch what you drink! Dentists say that soft drinks and fruit juices are bad for kids’ teeth. Those drinks are high in acid. The acid wears away tooth enamel. That is the hard covering on a tooth. If you drink a soft drink or fruit juice, use a straw. Dentists say that will help keep the acid away from your teeth. “Kids should not have more than half a cup of juice a day,” says Dr. Mary Hayes. She is a dentist. She is also a spokesperson for the American Dental Association. “Milk and water are better for your teeth,” says Hayes. “They make your teeth strong.”	2
Some cities have drills to get ready. A drill lets people practice what to do in case of a tornado. During a drill, tornado sirens sound. Weather alerts are given on the radio. They let people know to go to a safe room away from windows.	2
The sun is scorching hot! Scientists plan to send a spacecraft there in 2015. It is called Solar Probe+ (pronounced “Solar Probe Plus”). A probe is a machine used to collect information. Solar Probe+ will blast off from Earth in 2015. It will reach the sun about three months later. What will keep the probe from melting? It will have a shield and a coating. The coating will reflect, or send back, sunlight. The probe will be on a seven-year mission. During that time, it will orbit the sun 24 times. Scientists hope the probe will teach us more about the sun.	2
Many eggs recently hatched at SeaWorld in San Diego, California. The park is now home to 81 baby green sea turtles! Each turtle was about 3 inches long when it hatched. The baby turtles are fed krill, squid, and shrimps. SeaWorld has 32 adult green sea turtles. They are about 40 or 50 years old. Green sea turtles can live to be more than 100 years old. “We are so happy to have this many green sea turtles hatch,” says David Koontz. He is a SeaWorld spokesperson. “That allows us to study sea turtles as they grow.”	2
(2) The ground shakes. Magma moves under the volcano. It can cause earthquakes. An earthquake is a strong, shaking movement of the ground. Rocks break apart and form cracks in the volcano. (4) The volcano erupts! Lava comes out the top of the volcano. The top is called the main vent. Sometimes, gases and smoke burst out too.	2
Healthy foods are good for you! They help your body grow. They also give you energy to work and play. How do you know which foods to eat? Follow the food pyramid. Use it to make good choices. Choose more foods from groups on the pyramid with wider stripes. The grains group gives you energy. Make sure at least half the grains you eat are whole grains. Eat brown rice, oatmeal, and popcorn. Try whole-wheat bread instead of white bread. Color your plate with all kinds of veggies. They help your heart, eyes, skin, and teeth. Experts say to eat a rainbow of colors. Each color helps the body in a different way. Munch on carrots, corn, and broccoli. The meat and bean group is high in protein. That helps build strong muscles. Eat fish, chicken, lima beans, and nuts. Fruits are nature’s treats. They are sweet and tasty. They help your heart, eyes, skin, and teeth too. Eat a variety of colors. Try an apple or a banana. You can also mix pieces of different fruits to make a salad. Have milk and foods made with milk. Those foods are high in calcium. Calcium builds strong bones. Foods made with milk can be high in fat. Try low-fat milk, yogurt, and cheese. Your body needs only a little oil to keep it healthy. Some foods that have oils are nuts, tuna fish, and salad dressing. The child climbing the food pyramid is a reminder to exercise. Why might exercise be important?	2
Thank our veterans! They are people who have served in the armed forces. The armed forces keep our country safe. They serve in times of war and peace. Five main groups make up the armed forces. They are the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps (KOHR), and Coast Guard. Many kids have parents or other loved ones who are veterans. About 23 million veterans live in the United States. Two million of those veterans are women. November 11 is Veterans Day. Each year on that day, people honor our veterans. Many cities have parades. Some people give speeches. A large parade is held in New York City. Thousands of people take part in the event. Veterans march in the parade. Some people ride on floats. Marching bands play music. Some of the songs are patriotic. Something that is patriotic shows love for your country.	2
How do stinkbugs and burrower bugs send messages? They use plants like telephone lines! That is what a new study shows. The insects drum on leaves and stems. They also shake their bodies. That makes the plants vibrate. Other insects hear the vibrations. To do the study, scientists watched 21 species of stinkbugs and burrower bugs. The scientists measured the tiny vibrations using a laser. They learned that different species have their own vibration patterns. Males and females of the same species have different patterns too.	2
If insects could talk, what might they say? “I found food.” “Are you a relative?” “Watch out for danger!” Of course, insects don’t talk the way people do, but they do communicate with one another. That means they exchange information. A bee does the waggle dance. It walks in a figure eight and shakes its body. The farther away the food, the longer the bee shakes. The direction in which it walks tells other bees the way to the food. Honeybees get food from flowers. When a honeybee finds a field of flowers, it flies back to the hive. The bee tells the other bees where to find the food. How? It dances! The round dance shows that food is nearby. If the food is far away, the bee performs the waggle dance. That dance shows the location of the food. Fireflies have a chemical inside their bodies. It makes light. Fireflies flash lights at one another. Each species, or kind, of firefly has a different flash pattern. That helps the insects find members of their own species. The flash pattern also helps male and female fireflies find one another Grasshoppers send messages by chirping. They often rub a back leg against a wing. That causes a vibration and makes sound. Mostly male grasshoppers make sounds. They chirp to attract females. Each species of grasshopper has its own call. Some grasshoppers make sounds to warn other males to go away. Ants give off scents to pass along messages. If an ant finds food, it goes back to its nest. The ant leaves a scent trail along the way. Other ants follow the trail to find the food. They walk with their antennae to the ground. Why? Ants smell with their antennae. Ants can also leave a special scent to warn about danger.	2
On most days, you may see clouds in the sky. Where do they come from? When the sun heats oceans and lakes, water changes from a liquid to a gas. It rises into the air and cools. As it cools, the gas changes back into a liquid. It forms tiny drops of water or ice crystals. As they come together, they become clouds. (SIHR-uhss) clouds are thin and wispy. They look like hairs. They are found high in the sky. Cirrus clouds can bring a change in the weather. (KYOO-myuh-luhss) clouds are big and fluffy. They may look like cotton balls. They usually form low in the sky. Cumulus clouds often bring sunny, fair weather. (STRAH-tuhss) clouds are long layers of clouds. They look like a blanket. They are low in the sky. Stratus clouds can bring light rain. (kyoo-myuh-loh-NIM-buhss) clouds are big and gray. They are a kind of cumulus cloud. They can start near the ground and be very tall in the sky. Cumulonimbus clouds can bring heavy rain and thunderstorms. They also may mean a tornado is on the way. A tornado is a powerful, spinning wind.	2
The curtain opens. Dancers move to the music. All eyes are on them. Who are they? They are members of the Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater. The dance company is based in New York, New York. The dancers have performed all around the world for millions of people. Alvin Ailey was born in 1931. He started the dance company in 1958. He was a dancer and a choreographer (kor-ee-AH-grah-fehr). That is a person who creates new dances. Ailey created 79 ballets (BA-layz). Ballet is a kind of dance that tells a story. Ailey won many awards for his work. He died in 1989. The dance company recently celebrated 50 years of Ailey’s most famous ballet. It is called Revelations. It is based on Ailey’s experience growing up in Texas. At that time, laws in the South did not give black people the same rights as white people. “Alvin Ailey took his memories and turned them into a dance,” says Nasha Thomas-Schmitt. She is codirector of Ailey Arts in Education. “The colors, costumes, and set make the story come alive.” Ailey expressed how he felt through Revelations. The dance shows sadness, anger, joy, and hope. “The message of the ballet is something that reaches the human spirit,” says Thomas-Schmitt. “It is a masterpiece.”	2
What do May 30, June 14, and July 4 have in common? They are all U.S. holidays! May 30 is Memorial Day. The holiday honors Americans who died fighting in wars. Some people place American flags on the grave sites of those men and women. June 14 is Flag Day. Americans honor our country’s flag on this day. Some groups have parades to celebrate. People fly the flag outside homes and other buildings. July 4 is Independence Day. It celebrates our country’s birthday. Many people have parties and watch fireworks on this holiday.	2
Fire Prevention Week is from October 3 to 9. That is a time for kids and their families to learn about fire safety. Here are some tips to stay safe:	2
Earth Day is April 22. That day reminds people to take care of Earth. Here are some ways you can help. How can you help? Turn off the lights when you leave a room. Better yet—if it’s daytime, let the sun light up the room. Trash is piling up in landfills. Landfills are places where people bury trash. They are getting full. Paper takes up the largest amount of space in most landfills. How can you help? Use both sides of every sheet of paper. Reuse scrap paper in art projects. Recycle your old paper in a recycling bin. When you recycle something, it is made into something new. Most plastic bags are buried in landfills. Some bags are blown away and end up on beaches and in the ocean. Sea turtles and other ocean animals often mistake the bags for food. Thousands of animals die each year when they eat the bags. How can you help? If you buy something, don’t use plastic bags. Instead, take your own cloth bag to the store. It will reduce the amount of plastic bags being thrown away.	2
Move over, junk food! Good-bye, lazy bones! Experts say kids need to eat healthy foods and get more exercise. In the past 30 years, the rate of obesity has more than tripled among kids in the United States. Obesity is the condition of being very overweight. It can lead to health problems. Make good food choices. That gives the body the energy it needs to grow and heal. A healthy breakfast is the best way to start the day. Other meals should be well-balanced too. A good diet is made up of foods from these five food groups. Fruits help your heart, eyes, skin, and teeth. Snack on apples, oranges, berries, and grapes. Vegetables help your heart, eyes, skin, and teeth too. Try carrots, broccoli, and red peppers. Grains give you energy. Make sure half the grains you eat are whole. Try whole-grain bread and brown rice. Eat oatmeal and plain popcorn too. Dairy builds strong bones and teeth. Enjoy milk, yogurt, and cheese. Mostly choose fat-free or low-fat foods. Meat and beans help build strong muscles. Fish, chicken, and beans are in this group. Try nuts and seeds too. Experts say kids need an hour of exercise each day. Exercise helps burn body fat. It also makes your heart and muscles stronger. So what are you waiting for? Take out your jump rope or bicycle. Play catch with a friend. Take a walk. You can also play team sports, such as soccer. It does not matter what you choose. Just get moving!	2
Fourteen chubby hedgehogs in Scotland were recently put on a diet. Workers at a wildlife center had rescued the animals during a bad winter last year. The hedgehogs ate a lot of food at the center. What happens when hedgehogs get too fat? They cannot roll into a ball to protect themselves. When a hedgehog rolls into a ball, its spines stick out in all directions. That keeps predators away. A predator is an animal that eats another animal. The hedgehogs lost weight. They were returned to the wild. Now they can curl up into balls again. That will help them stay safe.	2
What sounds do you hear right now? You may hear a fan blowing, kids talking, or a bell ringing. All the sounds you hear travel in waves. Those waves enter your outer ear. They travel through your middle ear and inner ear. Your inner ear sends a message to your brain. Then you hear sound. Study the ear below to learn more. Sound is made when an object vibrates. That means it moves quickly back and forth. When people speak, their vocal cords vibrate. When you pluck a guitar string, it vibrates and makes sound. Did you know that sounds can travel through solid materials? Try this experiment with a partner to find out. Place a plastic ruler on a table. Make sure one end is hanging over the edge. Hold the ruler down with one hand. Ask your partner to place his or her ear against the surface of the table. With your other hand, gently snap the end of the ruler that is hanging over the floor. What did you and your partner see, hear, and feel?	2
We live in the United States. Canada is to the north. Mexico is to the south. See how the two countries are alike and how they are different. Land Canada has forests, mountains, and plains. Plains are areas of land without trees. Canada’s north is in the Arctic. That area is very cold. Family Most families in Canada are small. The average size is three people. School Kids in Canada start school at age 5 or 6. The school day lasts for about six hours. Language Canada has two official languages. They are English and French. Land Mexico has tropical rain forests, mountains, volcanoes, and deserts. In the center of Mexico is a high plain. Family Families in Mexico are often large. Parents, kids, and grandparents often live in the same house. School Most kids in Mexico start school at age 6. They attend elementary school for about four hours each day. Most students wear uniforms. What do Canada and Mexico have in common? How are they different?	2
How do some kids celebrate the holidays? They donate toys to boys and girls who may not be getting any toys. Toys for Tots is a program that collects toys. It is run by the U.S. Marine Corps Reserve. Major Bill Grein is a spokesperson for the program. He says, “Getting a new toy makes kids feel more positive. They feel good because they can look forward to the holidays.”	2
Eid al-Fitr (EED al-FIHtuhr) is a Muslim holiday. People celebrate for one to three days. They eat special foods, exchange gifts, and wear new clothes. Eid al-Fitr comes at the end of the Muslim month of Ramadan. Hanukkah is a Jewish holiday. It lasts for eight days. Every night, one candle is lit in a holder called a menorah. Children play a game with a spinning top called a dreidel. They receive chocolate coins and other gifts. Diwali is a Hindu holiday that lasts for two to five days. During that time, people light oil lamps and candles. They put them inside windows and doors and outside their homes. Las Posadas is a nine-day Mexican celebration. It ends on Christmas. Each night, people hold candles and sing. On the last night, they have parties. Kids break open piñatas filled with treats. Kwanzaa is an African American celebration of family and African culture. It lasts for seven days. People light candles in a holder called a kinara. They give one another handmade gifts. Christmas is a Christian holiday. Families decorate evergreen trees with lights and ornaments. Some people also string lights on the outside of their homes. On Christmas Day, people give one another gifts.	2
George Washington’s old home is getting a makeover. The home is in Virginia. It is called Mount Vernon. The home will be improved to help people with disabilities tour it. The home will have ramps for people who use wheelchairs. People who can’t hear will be able to take sign language tours. Audio tours will be given for people who can’t see. Audio is sound. Now everyone will be able to visit Mount Vernon to learn more about our first president. “Mount Vernon receives 1 million visitors a year,” says spokesperson Melissa Wood. “We’re looking forward to making the needed improvements so that every visitor may enjoy their experience.”	2
Some people fly airplanes into hurricanes! That is what Chad Gibson does. He is a member of a group called Hurricane Hunters. Hurricane Hunters measure the storm’s wind speed and strength. Scientists use that information to predict when and where a hurricane is going to hit land. What is it like to fly into a hurricane? “There are times when you just see the clouds,” says Gibson. “You really can’t see anything else.”	2
Every penny counts at Frankton Elementary School in Frankton, Indiana. Next month, students will take part in a contest called Jar Wars. Kids will drop money into jars. The grade that raises the most money will win a pizza party. All the money will be donated to help save tropical rain forests. Why? People are cutting down rain forest trees to make room for farms and roads. Many plants and animals are in danger of dying out. Last year, the school raised $891. This year, the goal is to raise even more. Teacher Ken Kakasuleff came up with the idea for Jar Wars 16 years ago. He says, “Earth is our home. We feel proud to protect it.”	2
Hundreds of kids will be dancing this summer. They will be going to AileyCamp. The camp is a free sixweek program for boys and girls ages 11 to 14. Some kids wait years to be accepted to the program. There are 10 AileyCamps across the country. The kids who are chosen live in poor sections of cities. “Those children don’t usually have a lot of arts experiences available to them,” says Nasha Thomas-Schmitt. She is codirector of Ailey Arts in Education. “Along with dance, they learn how to become responsible young people. We teach them not to give up on their dreams and to work hard.”	2
When kids get flu shots, everyone may end up healthier. That is what a new study shows. Almost 50 farming communities in Canada took part in the study. A community is a group of people living in an area. Kids in half the communities were given flu shots. Kids in the other half were not given flu shots. No adults were given flu shots. What did scientists learn? Fewer adults and kids in the flu shot group got the flu. The scientists say that giving flu shots to kids can protect the whole community.	2
It’s fiesta (fee-ESS-tuh) time! Fiesta is a Spanish word. It means “celebration.” Americans celebrate Hispanic culture this month. Culture is the way of life of a group of people. About 47 million people in the United States are Hispanic American. Their families come from countries where people speak Spanish. Music is a big part of Hispanic life. People don’t just listen. They get up and dance! Piñatas (peen-YAH-tuhss) are toys filled with treats. Kids take turns trying to break a piñata with a stick. They pick up the treats that fall out. The tortilla (tor-TEE-yuh) is a popular food. It is a type of flat bread. It is often filled with meat, beans, lettuce, tomato, and cheese. Then it is wrapped up and eaten. Yum! Many Hispanic Americans speak two languages—Spanish and English. Say “hola” (OH-lah). That means “hello” in Spanish.	2
Scientists around the world are on a search. They are looking for about 100 kinds of long-lost amphibians. The amphibians have not been seen in years. What happened to them? Nobody knows for sure. Some of the animals may be extinct. Something that is extinct is gone completely. Many of the amphibians are endangered. They are at risk of becoming extinct. Loggers cut down the forests where the animals live. They also face other dangers, including pollution and diseases. Frog expert Robin Moore helped organize the search. “This search will tell us a lot about how amphibians are doing,” he says. “I don’t know what we will find, but that makes the search even more exciting.”	2
Sonia Sotomayor (soh-toh-migh-YOR) rules! She made history last year. She became the first Hispanic American justice on the United States Supreme Court. A justice is a judge. What is the Supreme Court? It is the highest court in the United States. Nine justices decide what the laws of the Constitution mean. All other courts have to follow what the justices decide. Would you want to be a Supreme Court justice? Why or why not?	2
Sue has small holes in her jaw. For years, people have tried to find out why. Now scientists think they have found the answer. They say a parasite may have caused the holes. A parasite is a tiny creature that lives on another living thing. How did scientists find the answer? They studied bird bones. They found a bird jaw that had holes in it. They knew that when the bird was alive, it had a parasite. Scientists say a parasite could have made the dinosaur sick. That is what may have killed Sue.	2
Where on Earth can you find 700 pieces of Native American art? At the National Museum of the American Indian in New York City. The art is part of a new exhibit there. “The exhibit shows the variety of art in the museum’s collection,” says Quinn Bradley. She is a spokesperson for the museum. “It also shows the importance of each piece of art and the tribes that created them.”	2
What lives in the oceans? Scientists are trying to find out. They recently finished a 10-year study. It is called the Census of Marine Life. A census is a count. More than 2,000 scientists worked on the census. They explored all parts of the oceans. They discovered many new kinds of animals. Most of those animals live in the deepest parts of the oceans. Those areas had not been explored much until now. The census is just the beginning. “The ocean is simply so vast that, after 10 years of hard work, we still have only snapshots, though sometimes detailed, of what the sea contains. But it is an important and impressive start,” says Nancy Knowlton. She is a scientist who worked on the census.	2
Scientists have made a tooth discovery. They believe they have found the oldest tooth marks made by a mammal. A mammal is an animal with hair on its body. The tooth marks were made 75 million years ago. They were found on the bones of dinosaurs and other animals that lived long ago. Scientists say the mammal that made the marks was the size of a squirrel. Why do scientists think a mammal made the marks? The bites show pairs of upper and lower teeth. At that time, mammals were the only animals that had that trait. A trait is a special quality.	2
Earth is made up of habitats. Those are places in nature where animals and plants live. Tropical rain forests and deserts are two kinds of habitats. A tropical rain forest is a warm, rainy place. More than 100 inches of rain falls here each year. The forest is home to thousands of plants and animals. The plants grow close together. Food and water are easy to find. A tropical rain forest has different layers. Animals live in every layer. Butterflies and eagles can be found in the tops of the tallest trees. That is called the emergent layer. Most rain forest animals live in the canopy. It is made up of the tops of shorter trees. The jaguar can be found in the understory. That layer is under the leaves of many trees. It is cool and shady. Many insects live on the forest floor. It is dark and damp. Not much sunlight reaches it. A desert is a dry place. It gets little rain. Less than 10 inches of rain falls here each year. Deserts can be hot or cold. The ground is often sandy. Only plants and animals that do not need much water live here. A camel stores fat in its hump. When food is hard to find, it can live off the fat. A cactus is a plant that grows in a desert. Its roots take in water from the soil when it rains. The plant stores the water in its stem. Most desert animals get water from the foods they eat. A camel eats plants. It does not have to drink often. Many animals avoid the heat during the day. Lizards dig holes in the ground or hide under rocks. They come out at night to look for insects to eat.	2
What is black and white and wet all over? A penguin going for a swim! Penguins are birds. They have feathers and lay eggs. Unlike most birds, penguins don’t fly. They use their wings as flippers. Penguins flap their flippers to swim underwater. Their webbed feet help them steer. Penguins look for food in the ocean. They use their beaks to catch prey. Prey is an animal that is eaten by another animal. Penguins eat fish, squid, and krill. Krill are tiny animals that look like shrimps. On land, penguins walk with a waddle or a hop. They often slide on their bellies to travel over ice or snow. They use their flippers and feet to help them slide. Female penguins lay eggs on land. Both parents raise the chicks. The parents take turns finding food in the ocean. They throw up food and feed that to their chicks. Penguins live in the Southern Hemisphere. That is the part of Earth below the equator. The equator is the make-believe line around the center of Earth. Most penguins live in Antarctica, where it is cold. Some live near the equator. It is warm there.	2
African penguins are in trouble. Their numbers are getting smaller. The penguins were recently listed as endangered. That means they are at risk of dying out. The penguins are not able to find enough fish to eat. In 1956, about 120,000 African penguin pairs were counted. In 2009, only 26,000 pairs were counted. Scientists are trying to save the penguins. The scientists are working to close fishing areas near where the penguins live. They hope that will help the penguins find more fish.	2
A crew of six people recently sailed across the Pacific Ocean. They made the trip in a special boat named the Plastiki. It is made of 12,500 plastic bottles and other recycled materials. The crew spent four months sailing. They traveled from San Francisco, California, to Sydney, Australia. “[It was] an incredible feeling to finally arrive in Sydney,” says David de Rothschild. He was the crew’s leader. People built the Plastiki to teach a message. They want the oceans to be free of plastic trash. “The message we’re sending out is ‘What is your Plastiki? What can you do to change the world?’” says de Rothschild.	2
Astronauts and scientists were recently on a mission, but they were not in space. They were in the Arizona desert. Why? The team was preparing for future space missions. Arizona’s dry, dusty desert is similar to the surfaces of the moon and Mars. For 14 days, the astronauts and scientists tested space exploration vehicles. They also ate and slept in them. Each vehicle is about the size of a small van. Its wheels can move sideways. That helps it move across rough terrain. Terrain is the surface of an area of land. “We do the testing to make sure everything works properly. If you are on another planet, you can’t just go down to the local hardware store to get parts,” says mission manager Joe Kosmo. He works at NASA’s Johnson Space Center. NASA is the U.S. space agency.	2
Washington was the first president of the United States. He is known as the Father of Our Country. Lincoln was the 16th president. He fought to end slavery. Here are some ways our country honors those great leaders. Our country’s capital city is Washington, D.C. It is named after our first president. A memorial to honor President Washington is there. A memorial is something that keeps a memory alive. It is called the Washington Monument. It is more than 555 feet tall. The capital also has a memorial to honor Lincoln. The Lincoln Memorial is a building. A large statue of Lincoln is inside. It is 19 feet tall. Mount Rushmore is a famous memorial in South Dakota. The heads of Washington and Lincoln are carved into Mount Rushmore. Each head is as tall as a six-story building! The heads of two other U.S. presidents are also carved there. Where do we see the faces of Washington and Lincoln every day? On our money! Washington’s face appears on the quarter and $1 bill. Lincoln’s image is on the penny and $5 bill.	2
Frogs lead double lives. They are amphibians. An amphibian is an animal that lives part of its life in water and part on land. Frogs live on every continent except Antarctica. They can be found in many different places. Most frogs live near ponds and other wet places. They can be found in rain forests and deserts. Some live in caves. Some even live high in the mountains. When frogs are hungry, they hunt for food. What’s on the menu? Almost anything that moves! Frogs eat insects, worms, snails, and other small animals. Many frogs catch prey using their sticky tongues. Prey are animals eaten by other animals. Frogs don’t chew. They swallow their prey whole. Thirsty frogs don’t drink water. They absorb water through their skin. To absorb is to take in. Although frogs have lungs, they also breathe through their skin. They can do that only when their skin is moist. Frogs can become prey. Snakes, birds, and other animals eat them. Frogs often use their colors to stay safe. Some frogs hide with the help of camouflage (KA-muh-flahzh). Their colors, patterns, or shapes help them match their surroundings. That is why many frogs are brown or green. Other frogs are brightly colored. That warns animals to stay away. Bright colors mean that the frogs may taste bad or be poisonous.	2
May is Bike Safety Month. During this month, many communities will have activities to teach kids about bike safety. Events often include safety classes and helmet fittings. Why is it important that your helmet fit well? If it does not fit, it won’t protect your head. To work properly, a helmet should be straight on your head and fit snugly. If a helmet is too loose, it can slip to one side. “Riding a bike is a lot of fun, but remember that safety comes first,” says Dr. Jamie Freishtat. She is a children’s doctor and a spokesperson for Safe Kids. The group works to prevent childhood injuries. “Wear an approved bike helmet that fits properly every single time you get on your bike. Remember this rule: No helmet, no bike.”	2
Grab your beach towel and sunglasses! Summer is just around the corner. It starts on June 21. For most kids, that means more time to play outside. Experts say that more injuries occur during summer. Follow these tips to make sure you have a safe summer. Many kids will spend hours playing outside in the summer sun. Be careful, though. The sun’s rays can be harmful. They can cause damage to your skin and eyes. If you are out in the sun, be sure to wear sunscreen. Experts say it should have a sun protection factor (SPF) of 30 or higher. The SPF number lets you know how much the sunscreen protects your skin from the sun. Make sure you rub it in everywhere your skin is showing. You should also wear a hat and sunglasses. They protect against the sun’s harmful rays. Better yet, play in the shade! What is one way to beat the heat? Splash in a pool! Just be sure to follow water-safety rules. Always swim with a grown-up watching you. You should also swim with a buddy. A buddy can tell others if someone needs help. If you don’t know how to swim, stay in the shallow end. Something that is shallow is not deep. Biking and in-line skating are great ways to get exercise. To stay wheel safe, always wear a helmet. It protects your head and brain if you fall. If you are in-line skating, also wear wrist guards, elbow pads, and kneepads.	2
Kids are helping keep track of monarchs. The kids are putting tags on the butterflies. The tags are tiny stickers. Each tag has a number on it. The number shows when and where each monarch was found. Scientists look for monarchs with the tags. They want to keep track of them. Why? The number of monarchs is getting smaller. People are cutting down plants and trees where the butterflies live. Scientists want to learn more about monarchs so they can save them.	2
What can you do with some paper, markers, and kind words? Show a veteran that you care. That is how some students will honor our veterans. They will make thank-you cards. “Veterans have made great sacrifices to serve our country. They deserve our respect and gratitude,” says Laurie Tranter. She is a spokesperson for the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs. “Receiving a thank-you card can put a smile on a veteran’s face. It lets that person know he or she is appreciated.”	2
The sentences below explain how a hurricane forms, but they are out of order. Number the sentences 1 through 4 to put them in the correct order. We’ve done the last one for you. Fill in the word that completes the sentence below. The ____ ____ ____ is the center of a hurricane. It is calm there.	2
Scientists have found a spider fossil in China. A fossil is the remains of an animal or a plant that lived long ago. The spider lived 165 million years ago. Dinosaurs ruled Earth at that time. Spider fossils that old are rare. That means people have found very few of them. “This spider belongs to a family of spiders that is still alive today,” says scientist Paul Selden. He studied the fossil. “They are found in the United States and Mexico.”	2
A hurricane is a spinning storm. It brings heavy rain and strong winds. Most hurricanes happen at this time of year. The season lasts from June to November. Do you live in an area where hurricanes happen? If so, know what to do. Check weather alerts. They will tell you how to stay safe. Hurricane winds can be harmful. They can rip the roofs off houses and tear down trees. Strong winds can also cause big waves to form in the ocean. When the large waves push onto the shore, it is called a storm surge. That can cause flooding. (1) Warm ocean water turns into tiny drops of water in the air. They form clouds. (2) Winds make the clouds spin together. They spin faster and faster.	2
How many U.S. landmarks can you name? Landmarks are buildings or places that are well-known. They are symbols of our country. Let’s explore some of them! The Statue of Liberty is in New York, New York. It is located on Liberty Island. People can visit the statue by taking a ferry to the island. A ferry is a boat used to carry passengers. The statue was a gift of friendship from the people of France. It was shipped to the United States in 350 pieces. The statue was rebuilt. It was completed in 1886. The Gateway Arch is in St. Louis, Missouri. It was completed in 1965. The arch is 630 feet tall. Visitors can ride a tram to the top. A tram is a car that travels on overhead cables. The arch was built to look like a gateway, or entrance, to the West. It honors American pioneers who traveled west across the United States long ago. Pioneers are people who are among the first to settle in new places. The Golden Gate Bridge is in San Francisco, California. It opened in 1937. It is a suspension bridge. That means the roadway hangs from cables. The cables are connected to towers. People can cross the bridge by car, by bicycle, or on foot. The bridge is almost 9,000 feet long It crosses the Golden Gate Strait. A strait is a narrow channel of water that connects two large bodies of water. The Liberty Bell is in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. It was made in 1753. The bell weighs about 2,000 pounds. It was rung to call people together for special events and announcements. Soon after the bell was made, it cracked. People tried to fix the bell, but it cracked again. The bell has not been rung since then. It now hangs in a museum. Many people visit the bell to see the crack that made it famous. If you were asked to create a new landmark for our country, what would it be? Why?	2
Amelia Earhart loved to fly. She was a famous American pilot. Earhart was born in Atchison, Kansas, in 1897. As a child, she liked adventure. She dared to play games that some people thought were just for boys. She climbed trees and played sports. She liked to hunt for rats. In 1920, Earhart was given her first ride on an airplane. That is when she decided to learn how to fly. She had her first flying lesson the next year. Soon after, she bought her first airplane. It was painted yellow. She called it the Canary. A canary is a small bird that is usually yellow. Earhart set many flight records and won awards. She made the news often and gained fame. In 1932, she became the first woman to fly solo across the Atlantic Ocean. Solo means “alone.” At that time, many people believed that flying airplanes was a man’s activity. Earhart tried to change that belief. She gave speeches and wrote books. She encouraged other women to learn how to fly. In 1937, Earhart attempted to set another record. She wanted to become the first woman to fly around the world. During that trip, she disappeared and was never seen again. Experts say that her airplane might have run out of fuel. Over the years, many people have tried to find Earhart’s airplane. To this day, the Amelia Earhart story remains a mystery. A giant balloon of Amelia Earhart is touring the country. The balloon is 45 feet long. It shows Earhart in a red airplane she once flew. “Most balloon characters are male. No one has ever made a balloon of a historical woman before,” says Lynette Long. She is the president of Equal Visibility Everywhere (EVE). The group wants more women to be shown in symbols across the country. Why did the group choose Amelia Earhart? “She is a great role model for young girls,” says Long. “She was fearless. We want young girls to say, ‘Hey, I can do anything!’” The Amelia Earhart balloon is just the start. EVE hopes to make more balloons of famous American women. “Our hope is to make one each year,” Long says. What kind of person was Amelia Earhart? Why might so many women look up to her?	2
You have sore muscles and a fever. All you want to do is sleep. What is making you feel so yucky? It could be the flu. That is an illness caused by a virus. A virus is a tiny creature that invades the body. It makes people sick. The flu can pass easily from one person to another. A sick person sneezes and coughs. Tiny flu germs spread through the air. You can catch the flu if you breathe in those germs. Watch out. You can also get sick if you touch the virus with your hands and then touch your eyes, nose, or mouth. What is the best way to avoid the flu? Get a flu shot, say health experts. The shot is a vaccine (vak-SEEN). That is something put into the body to help fight off a virus.	2
Monarch butterflies live in fields where milkweed plants grow. They drink nectar from plants with flowers. Nectar is a sweet liquid food. In the fall, monarch butterflies take a long trip. They migrate (MY-grayt). That means they move from one place to another. Monarchs in the United States and Canada fly south to warmer places. Most fly to Mexico. In the winter, monarchs rest. They stay close together on trees. That keeps them warm. It also keeps them safe from wind and rain. In early spring, monarch butterflies fly north. On the way, female monarchs lay eggs on milkweed plants The eggs hatch, and the new butterflies fly north.	2
Turn down the music! A new study shows that many young people have hearing damage. Health experts say one likely cause is MP3 players. Why? The music players send loud sounds straight into the ears. A loud sound can damage hair cells. They are tiny nerve endings in the inner ear. If a sound is loud enough, the damage can be permanent. That means it will last forever. How can you tell whether your music is too loud? While listening to music, you should be able to hear someone talking from a few feet away. You can also ask friends whether they can hear music from your earphones. If they say yes, turn it down.	2
Taking care of your teeth is important. It keeps plaque from building up. Plaque is a sticky film that can cause gum disease and cavities. A cavity is a hole in a tooth. 1 Brush twice a day with a soft toothbrush. Make sure you brush for two to three minutes. Hum a song to time yourself. You can also brush your tongue. That will help freshen your breath. Get a new toothbrush every three to four months. 2 Floss gently once a day. That cleans between your teeth. Don’t forget to floss behind the last tooth in each row. Ask an adult if you need help. 4 Eat foods that are good for you. They include fresh fruits and vegetables.	2
Water is often used to put out fires. A foam mixture may also be used. The foam sprays out of a fire hose. It covers the fire and lowers the temperature. It absorbs, or takes in, heat. Firefighters wear special clothes to stay safe. The clothes are called turnout gear. That gear includes a helmet, a jacket, pants, boots, and gloves. Firefighters also carry oxygen in tanks. Oxygen is a gas in the air that people breathe. We need oxygen to stay alive. Firefighters work as a team to fight fires. Why might teamwork be important when firefighters put out a fire?	2
Tornado season has hit the United States. Tornadoes are also known as twisters. They can happen at any time of year. However, they are most common from March to July. Most tornadoes begin as thunderstorms. Air rises from the ground to the storm clouds. Sometimes that rising air starts to spin. A funnel-shaped cloud can form. When the bottom of the cloud touches the ground, it becomes a tornado. Most tornadoes last fewer than 15 minutes. During that time, they can travel across large areas of land. Winds can reach speeds of 300 miles per hour. The storms can destroy everything in their paths.	2
An ocean is a large body of salt water. It can be divided into three layers called zones. The deeper the water, the colder it gets. Read a about each zone to learn more. The top layer of the ocean is called the sunlit zone. It gets enough sunlight for plants to grow. All ocean plants and most ocean animals live here. Whales and dolphins live in this zone. They need to swim to the surface to breathe air. The porcupine fish lives here too. It puffs up and raises its spines to scare off predators. A predator is an animal that eats another animal for food. The ocean is colder in the twilight zone. Only dim light reaches this area. Plants cannot grow in this zone. Fewer animals live here than in the sunlit zone. Jelly fish and octopuses are often found here. Many jellyfish have stinging tentacles. Jellyfish use their tentacles to capture prey. Prey are animal that are eaten by predators. Octopuses have suction cups on their tentacles. That helps them hold on to prey. The midnight zone is dark. It is also very cold. Plants do not grow in this zone. Animals here often have sharp teeth and big jaws. Many animals, such as the ratfish, have large eyes. That helps them see in the dark. Some animals, such as the deep sea hatchetfish, give off light. Their light blends in with the small amount of sunlight from above. That helps them hide from predators below.	2
Space is an exciting place! That is where our solar system is located. It is made up of the sun and the eight planets that travel around the sun. Our solar system also has moons and other space objects. The sun is at the center of our solar system. The sun is a hot, bright star. A star is a ball of hot gas. It gives off heat and light. The sun is the star closest to Earth. That is why it looks different from other stars. Most stars look tiny and can be seen only at night because they are so far away. A planet is a large ball made of rock or gas. Our solar system has eight planets. You live on one of them—Earth! The others are Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune. Each planet moves in a path around the sun. The path is called an orbit. Earth has one moon. It travels in an orbit around Earth. The moon is made of rock. It is covered with deep holes called craters. The moon may look as though it gives off light, but it does not. It looks bright when it reflects light from the sun.	2
First Lady Michelle Obama is on a health kick. She recently asked restaurants to offer more healthy choices for kids. She is leading a campaign called Let’s Move! A campaign is a series of activities designed to bring about a result. The first lady hopes the campaign will help kids choose healthy foods and get active.	2
Sue is super! She is the largest and most complete T. rex fossil ever found. A fossil is the remains of an animal or a plant that lived long ago. Many people visit Sue each year. Read the time line below to learn more about Sue. Fossil hunter Sue Hendrickson finds the T. rex bones. They are sticking out of a cliff in South Dakota. The fossil is named after Sue. The bones arrive at the Field Museum in Chicago, Illinois. Scientists clean and study them. Sue goes on display at the museum. People come to see the new exhibit.	2
U.S. President Barack Obama wants to prevent bullying. To prevent something is to keep it from happening. He recently held a meeting about bullying. It took place at the White House. He invited people from across the country. Students, teachers, and parents attended. The president says he was bullied as a child. Other kids made fun of his big ears and unusual name. He wants all children to feel safe at school. “We should treat others the way we want to be treated,” he says.	2
Lighters are not toys. Some lighters are made to look like toys, though. They are dangerous. Kids have played with them and started fires. Some kids have gotten hurt. Fire officials want to keep kids safe. They want states to ban the sale of the lighters. To ban is to stop with a rule or a law. Maine became the first state to pass such a law, in 2008. Since then, about 13 other states have done the same. “Lighters should only be handled by adults,” says Tom Olshanski. He is a spokesperson for the U.S. Fire Administration. That group focuses on fire safety. “Fire burns,” he says. “We will continue to work until all 50 states ban the sale of these lighters.” This lighter looks like a cell phone. How might that be a danger to people?	2
A team of 47 scientists went on a trip this past summer. They studied the Arctic Ocean. The scientists left from Alaska on June 25. They stayed in the Arctic for five weeks. They traveled on a ship. It is called the U.S. Coast Guard Cutter Healy. The ship is an icebreaker. It can break through the Arctic ice. The scientists are studying the sea ice and ocean life. Sea ice floats on top of the water in the winter. “Satellites have shown there is less sea ice in the Arctic now than there was 10 years ago,” says Steve Cole. He is a NASA spokesperson. NASA is the U.S. space agency. “We are studying the details of how the sea ice is changing. We want to know how that is affecting life in the ocean.” Satellites are objects that orbit, or travel around, a planet. People have put satellites into space to take photos of Earth. Why might that be useful?	2
A famous garden is ripe for the picking. It is the White House garden. First Lady Michelle Obama planted it in 2009. The first lady invites kids to help with the harvest each fall. They dig up sweet potatoes. They pick carrots. They gather lettuce. Then they eat a fresh salad from the garden. What happens after the harvest? Chefs use the vegetables to make meals for the Obama family. Vegetables are also donated to food banks. They give food to people in need.	2
Smoke alarms save lives. Have an alarm inside and outside each bedroom. Make sure you have a smoke alarm on every level of the home. Push the test button at least once a month. That will let you know whether the alarm is working. Choose a safe place outside where everyone will meet. Get out and stay out! Never go back inside a burning building. Why is it important to have a home fire escape plan? How might practicing it help you?	2
A hurricane is a spinning storm. It can cause a lot of damage. It brings heavy rain and strong winds. It can cause flooding too. The pilots have a hard job. They fly through the eyewall. That is a windy wall of clouds. The ride can be very bumpy. Pilots also fly into the eye of the storm. The eye is the calm center. Special pilots fly into the storms! The pilots are in the Air Force. They are known as Hurricane Hunters. They are busy at this time of year. Most hurricanes happen between June and November. Pilots collect data (DAY-tuh) inside the storm. Data is facts and numbers. Pilots measure the wind speed and direction. Weather experts use the data to warn people of the storms. Would you like to be a Hurricane Hunter? Why or why not?	2
Animals need food to survive. In some places, winter brings cold weather. Food is hard to find. Groundhogs hibernate to survive the winter. When an animal hibernates, it goes into a long, deep sleep. A groundhog starts to get ready in the fall. It eats a large amount of plants. Its body stores fat. The animal will live off the extra fat in the winter. The groundhog digs a den. A den is an underground hole. Groundhogs have separate winter and summer dens. Each den has different chambers, or rooms. When the weather gets colder, the groundhog goes inside a sleeping chamber. It closes the opening with dirt. Then the animal rolls up into a ball and hibernates. The groundhog’s body slows down. Its heartbeat slows. Its body temperature drops. Its breathing slows too. When the weather gets warmer, the groundhog wakes up. It is very hungry! It moves from its winter den to its summer den. The animal eats plants that are growing nearby.	2
Many children are in need of winter coats. Operation Warm is a group that wants to make sure those kids are cozy. The group gives away new coats to kids whose families don’t have enough money to buy coats. “The new coats bring smiles to kids’ faces,” says Cydney Irving-Dasent. She is a spokesperson for the group. Operation Warm started in 1998. The group expects to give away its millionth coat this winter! “We are really excited about reaching this important milestone,” says Irving-Dasent. “Our goal is to serve as many children as possible. A million is a really big number. After that, we are looking forward to giving away the next million.”	2
Miller Farms is busy with its fall harvest. The farm is in Platteville, Colorado. It grows many vegetables. Carrots, beets, and onions are just a few of them. David Patterson works on the farm. He told Weekly Reader how food is harvested. 1 “We pick the vegetables by hand each day. Carrots are kind of tough to pick. You have to loosen them with a shovel first.” 2 “We bring the food in from the field with trucks. We put the food into crates.” 3 “The crates get loaded onto a truck. We take the food to farmers markets to sell it. It’s all fresh and good.”	2
Scientists are keeping track of monarch butterflies. Over the years, the number of monarchs has been getting smaller. Why? People in Mexico are cutting down trees where the butterflies live. Now, the latest numbers are up. Twice as many monarchs made the trip to Mexico last year as did the year before! “It’s good news, but it’s not that good,” says Lincoln Brower. He is a monarch expert. “I’m very worried about the butterflies. There needs to be more protection of the forest in Mexico.”	2
Which animal was a big part of Native American life long ago? The horse, of course! That is what one museum exhibit is about. An exhibit is a show. The exhibit opened October 29 in Washington, D.C. It can be seen at the National Museum of the American Indian.	2
Q: Why did the candle do so well in school? A: It was very bright!	2
Constitution Day is September 17. That is the day our Constitution was signed. What is it? The Constitution is a set of laws for our country. A law is a rule. Why was it written? Our country had many different rules. People wanted to have one set of rules. Who wrote it? A group of leaders worked together to write the Constitution. This painting is an artist’s idea of what that meeting looked like. Where was it written? The leaders met in Independence Hall. That is a famous building in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. When was it written? The Constitution was written in 1787. That was more than 200 years ago! How was it written? The Constitution has more than 4,000 words. A quill (KWIL) was used to write those words. A quill is a pen made from a feather. It is dipped in ink.	2
The Arctic is cold and windy. Snow and ice cover the ground for most of the year. The habitat is near the North Pole. A habitat is a place in nature where a plant or an animal normally lives. Bundle up! Meet some animals that live in the Arctic. The harp seal lives in the water. It can also be found on the ice. The harp seal has thick fur. That helps it stay warm. The seal also has blubber under its skin. Blubber is fat that protects an animal from the cold. A harp seal rests with its pup. A pup is a baby seal. The arctic fox travels on snow and ice. It has thick, white fur in the winter. The fur acts as camouflage (KA-muh-flahzh). It helps the animal match its surroundings. The fox uses its bushy tail as a warm cover. The fox can curl its tail around its face. The polar bear spends much of its time on the ice. It hunts for seals through holes in the ice. The polar bear can swim too. A layer of blubber keeps the bear warm. It also has thick, white fur. The fur blends in with the snow. That helps the polar bear sneak up on seals.	2
Some students in Nebraska think of veterans as “lifesavers.” The kids attend Dakota City Elementary School. They decided to have a candy sale. What did they sell? Life Savers! The students made more than a thousand dollars. They donated the money to help build a park. The park will honor veterans. It will be called Siouxland Freedom Park. “It will be a living memorial that will honor veterans—past, present, and future. We look forward to groups of students coming to visit,” says Mike Newhouse. He is the president of the Siouxland Freedom Park project. He is also a veteran. Students at Dakota City Elementary School sell Life Savers. The money raised will help build a park to honor veterans.	2
Many holidays take place toward the end of the year. People often use lights as part of the celebrations. Hanukkah is a Jewish holiday. It is also called a festival of lights. It is celebrated for eight days. People light candles in holders. The holders are called menorahs. Diwali is a Hindu holiday. It is also called Deepavali. It lasts for five days. The holiday is known as a festival of lights. People decorate their homes with lights, oil lamps, and candles. Las Posadas is a Mexican holiday. It is celebrated for nine days. Each night, people hold candles and sing while they walk through their neighborhoods. Kwanzaa is an African American celebration of African culture. It lasts a week. People light candles in holders called kinaras. The candles are green, black, and red. Christmas is a Christian holiday. Many people celebrate Christmas Day on December 25. People decorate trees with lights. Some people also hang lights on the outside of their homes. Ramadan is a Muslim holiday. It lasts a month. People decorate their homes with special lanterns. The lanterns are usually made of colorful glass. Kids may also carry lanterns in the street.	2
Workers at a museum in Kansas recently found an old letter. It was dated January 27, 1793. The letter was written by Martha Washington. She was the wife of President George Washington. She sent the letter to her niece. The letter was donated to the museum in 1959. Then it was misplaced. Workers soon forgot about the letter. “Nobody here knew about it. It slipped out of its folder. It ended up on the bottom of a drawer,” says Aline Luecke. She is a spokesperson for the museum. “We were really excited to get it again,” says Luecke. Martha Washington wrote her letter with a quill. The letter was found at the Cloud County Historical Society Museum.	2
Each fall, monarch butterflies fly away. They migrate (MY-grayt). They travel to warmer places before winter begins. Learn where the butterflies go. The air gets colder. Monarchs need to stay warm. Most fly south to Mexico. Mexico is a country. Millions of monarchs rest on trees in Mexico. They stay close together. That helps keep them safe and warm. Monarchs drink nectar from flowers. Nectar is a sweet liquid food. Monarchs drink nectar to store up energy. Monarchs fly back north. On the way, female monarchs lay eggs on plants. The eggs hatch. The young butterflies fly north.	2
When the sun goes down, some animals wake up! They are nocturnal. They are active at night. They sleep during the day. Many owls, bats, and snakes are nocturnal. They have special ways to find prey in the dark. Prey is an animal that is hunted by another animal for food. Owls can see well at night. They also have great hearing. The feathers on the edge of their wings are soft. That lets owls fly quietly. They can sneak up on their prey. Owls hunt mice and other small animals. Most bats eat insects. Bats have a special way of finding food. They make high-pitched sounds. The sounds bounce off insects and return to the bats. That lets the bats know where to find the insects. Pit vipers are snakes. They sense the heat of other animals. Their heat sensors are inside holes on their faces. The holes are called pits. They help the snakes find their prey in the dark. Pit vipers eat frogs and other small animals.	2
Most bats nap in caves or trees. One kind of bat naps in a strange place. It snoozes inside the leaves of a bug-eating plant! That is what scientists recently discovered. A Hardwicke’s woolly bat naps in a pitcher plant leaf. Can you spot the bat? The plant’s leaves are shaped like cups. They trap bugs inside. The bat is safe there. It stays hidden from predators. A predator is an animal that eats another animal for food. The bat leaves behind something that helps the plant—poop. It becomes food for the plant. The Hardwicke’s woolly bat is tiny. It is about the size of a car key.	2
The sound of drums fills the air. People start to sing and dance. A powwow has begun. A powwow is a festival. It celebrates Native American life. People sing songs in Native American languages. Some of the songs are old. Other songs are new. People sing to the beat of a drum. Dancers move to the beat. The drum is an important part of the powwow. Dancers wear special clothes at a powwow. The clothes are made by hand. As the dancers get older, they add pieces to the clothes. Some of the pieces are gifts from family and friends. People sell arts and crafts at some powwows. The artists make each item by hand. The arts and crafts often include beadwork, baskets, and pottery. Fry bread is often found at powwows. The bread is sometimes used to make special tacos. People put meat, lettuce, tomatoes, cheese, and hot peppers on top of the bread. Then they roll it up and eat it. Is it important to learn about Native American life? Why or why not?	2
Students recently planted trees in Brechtel Park. It is in New Orleans, Louisiana. The park lost thousands of trees in 2005. A big hurricane hit the area then. Its name was Hurricane Katrina. The students worked hard. They raised money to buy the trees. How? They sold T-shirts and had an art fair. The group planted about 100 trees. “The event was a great success,” says Brad Philipson. He is a teacher at Metairie Park Country Day School. “One day, these kids will come back and see how the trees have grown.”	2
Your bones are still growing. Exercise helps build strong bones. Do all kinds of exercise build bones? No! That is what a recent study has found. Experts say vigorous activities are best. They take a lot of energy. Light exercise, such as walking, does not help bones. Experts say running and playing sports help kids build strong bones. Which vigorous activities might help you build strong bones? “Kids should run and play sports,” says Jon Tobias. He is the scientist who led the study. “Those exercises make you a bit out of breath. They are good at building stronger bones.”	2

Get ready to honor our veterans! Veterans are people who have served in the military. The U.S. military is made up of five main groups—the Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps (KOHR), and Coast Guard. The military keeps our country safe. About 22 million veterans live in the United States. Americans honor them in many ways. Many cities have parades on Veterans Day. People hold U.S. flags. Veterans dress in uniform. They march in the parades. Some ride in floats. Bands play patriotic songs. Something that is patriotic shows love for your country. Some schools stay open on Veterans Day. They have special activities. Veterans often visit and give speeches. They talk about what they did for our country. How do some kids show their thanks? They make cards and write letters. They mail them to nearby medical centers for veterans. Those centers are located across the country. A veteran receives a U.S. flag during a ceremony at the U.S. Marine Corps War Memorial. It is in Arlington, Virginia. Many memorials honor veterans. A memorial is a statue or a place that honors a person or an event. Ceremonies are often held at the memorials.	2
Kids often share musical instruments. A new study shows they may be sharing more than just a love of music. They may be sharing germs too! Experts say germs can live on wind instruments for days. Players blow into them to make sound. The flute and the recorder are wind instruments. Dr. Stuart Levy led the study. He says, “Children should not share musical wind instruments. If they do, the instruments should be washed carefully before being shared.”	2
Ahchoo! Many people get sick at this time of year. They often catch a cold or the flu. How can you tell those illnesses apart? Each has certain symptoms. A symptom is a sign of an illness. A cold lasts for about a week. It is often mild. Something that is mild is not strong. A cold usually begins with a sore throat. Then it causes a runny or stuffy nose. People often cough too. Kids may get a slight fever. The flu can last for weeks. It is much more severe than a cold. Something that is severe is serious. The flu usually begins with a high fever. It can make people very tired and weak. It often causes sore muscles and headaches. It may also cause a cough, a runny nose, and a sore throat. Colds and the flu pass easily from one person to another. How can you stay healthy? Wash your hands often. Try not to touch your eyes, nose, and mouth. Germs can enter your body through those places. Health experts say kids should also get a flu shot. It protects against the flu.	2
"Coming soon to a television near you--Jackie Chan! The martial arts star will have his own animated series, called Jackie Chan Adventures. In the show, Chan will be a secret government agent who lives in San Francisco. Chan will serve as a model for the show's animators, artists who draw motion picture cartoons. The show will include many of Chan's hair-raising stunts. But Chan doesn't want kids to get the wrong idea. ""We make a point not to make it violent. I tell kids violence is no good."""	3
The Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR) is located in northern Alaska. The ANWR is home to polar bears, wolves, caribou, and other animals. In 1960, the land was made a protected area for animals and plants. But now, President George W. Bush wants to allow companies to begin drilling for oil in the ANWR. Supporters say that the oil drilling would provide jobs for Alaskans. They also argue that the oil in the ANWR will help lower oil and gasoline prices. They say that taking oil from U.S. land is cheaper than using foreign oil. Opponents say the drilling would pollute the area's land, air, and water. Pollution would harm the plants that the area's animals eat to survive. Studies by the U.S. government show there may be only a six-month supply of oil in the ANWR. Opponents believe the risk of polluting the ANWR is not worth such a small supply of oil.	3
"In 1839, La Amistad, a Spanish ship, set sail from Cuba. The ship was carrying 53 African people who had been sold as slaves. During the voyage, the slaves rebelled and took control of the ship. They tried to return to their homes in Africa. Instead La Amistad sailed, by accident, to the United States. The Africans were arrested and put on trial. The court decided that the Africans were not pirates or slaves and that they should be free. Many Africans returned to their homes in Sierra Leone, Africa, but some stayed in the United States. Bill Pickney is the captain of the modern Amistad. This summer, he sailed the ship in OpSail 2000, a festival of sailing ships. He is proud to teach people about La Amistad. ""The Amistad teaches you to take a stand for freedom,"" Pickney said."	3
"In September, the United States government said it would send the ""Kennewick Man"" home. Kennewick Man is a 9,000-year-old skeleton found in 1996. Home for the ancient skeleton is near the Columbia River in the state of Washington. The Kennewick Man is known as the ""Ancient One"" to many Native American peoples. The groups believe the skeleton is the remains of one of their ancestors, or relatives who lived before them. They plan to bury the skeleton again out of respect for their history."	3
Look out, Britney Spears and the Backstreet Boys! Here comes the next hot musical act: the animals! Scientists recently announced that the music made by several kinds of birds and humpback whales shares some of the notes, rhythms, and harmonies found in music created by people. Scientists say that these animals may also pass songs along to one another, which means animals may be able to learn music.	3
This timeline shows six famous explorations of Antarctica. Study the timeline. Write the answer to each question on a piece of paper. 2. In which year was the first airplane flight over Antarctica? 4. In which year was the first airplane flight over the South Pole? 5. How many years after Roald Amundsen's trip to the South Pole will Liv Arnesen and Ann Bancroft explore Antarctica?	3
In 1914, a group of explorers, led by Sir Ernest Shackleton, wanted to cross Antarctica. However, after two months of sailing, they never even made it to Antarctica's shore. Their ship became trapped in floating ice blocks for nine months. Later, when their ship, Endurance, was crushed by the closing ice, Shackleton and 28 men were forced to camp on the ice. After camping on the ice for five months, Shackleton and five men sailed 800 miles in a tiny lifeboat to get help. The remaining crew was later rescued. Amazingly, all 29 men on the Endurance survived being stranded for 17 months on Antarctica's ice.	3
"Nicole Thompson and her third-grade social studies students at Greenbriar Academy in North Carolina wanted to learn about world geography. So late last year, they sent an e-mail message to 100 people. Readers were asked to send the e-mail message to people in other places. Readers were also asked to write something about themselves as well. About six weeks later, Thompson and her students received more than 60,000 e-mail replies! Messages came from every state in the United States and from 120 countries. According to Thompson, the students' favorite response was written by a carpenter at McMurdo Station in Antarctica. ""It was a huge deal. We didn't think we would hear from Antarctica!"" Thompson said."	3
"Until recently, about 20 Tyrannosaurus rex (or T. rex) skeletons had ever been found. But last summer, scientists found five T. rex fossils in one place. Now some scientists say more of those dinosaurs may have roamed Earth than they had thought before. ""A T. rex is discovered once every ten years. So five at once is pretty neat,"" said Jack Horner, the scientist who found the fossils. Horner says one of the T. rex fossils he uncovered is special. So far, only the dinosaur's jawbone and ribs have been found. But measuring those bones shows that they might belong to the largest T. rex ever found. The largest, most complete T. rex found until last summer is known as Sue. Sue is named after Sue Hendrickson, the scientist who discovered the fossil in 1990. The T. rex is on display at a museum in Chicago, Illinois. Sue was 42 feet long and had teeth that were about 7 inches to 12 inches long. Scientists estimate, or guess, that Sue weighed more than 14,000 pounds, or 7 tons, when alive. Back in Montana, Horner hopes to finish uncovering all five T. rex fossils by next summer. He is helping to build a museum near where the fossils were found. ""We're going to fill it with fossils,"" Horner said. ""It's going to be fun."""	3
"The Amazon River is the longest river in South America. It flows for 4,000 miles across the continent. The location of the river's source, or beginning, was a mystery for centuries. A team of explorers and geography experts recently found the tiny stream where the mighty river begins. High on the Nevado Mismi, an 18,363-foot-high mountain in Peru, a stream trickles from the melting snow. A team of 22 explorers and geography experts recently announced that this small stream is the source of the mighty Amazon River. Andrew Pietowski, a high school math teacher in New York, led the team in search of the river's source. The team searched the Andes, a range of mountains that stretches the whole western length of South America. ""Since the Amazon River has an end, there must be a beginning. I wanted to know where it was,"" Pietowski said. On its way across South America, the Amazon River flows through the largest rain forest in the world. A rain forest is a dense forest that has a lot of rainfall and warm temperatures all year round. The Amazon rain forest is almost as big as the continent of Australia. Scientists say about 80,000 different types of trees and plants can be found in the Amazon rain forest. More kinds of fish live in the Amazon River than in the Atlantic Ocean. The river flows through forests that are home to jaguars, armadillos, snakes, monkeys, crocodiles, and anteaters. Along the river live about 170 different groups of native people. Many areas of the Amazon River have never been explored. Why do you think that is?"	3
February is the month in which millions of Americans celebrate African American history. Many important events in African American history took place in February. For example, Rosa Parks was born during this month. In 1955, Parks was arrested when she refused to give up her seat to a white passenger on a Montgomery, Alabama, city bus. In some places at that time, it was illegal for a black person to sit in the front of a bus. Parks's arrest led to a boycott of, or refusal to use, the bus company. Many blacks refused to ride the city buses for more than a year, until those unfair laws were changed. In 1926, the historian Carter G. Woodson declared a week honoring black history. He chose the February week with the birthdays of President Abraham Lincoln and Frederick Douglass. Douglass was a former slave who, in the 1800s, fought to outlaw slavery. The celebration was changed to a monthlong event in 1976.	3
Mars is about to become a busy place. Recently, the U.S. space agency, NASA, announced plans to send six spacecraft to Mars in the next ten years. Scientists hope the missions will answer questions about Mars. The spacecraft will take pictures of the planet. Some spacecraft will even collect samples of the soil on Mars to study. NASA first sent spacecraft to Mars in the 1960s. Since then, several spacecraft have landed on Mars. One of the most exciting landings happened in 1997, when Mars Pathfinder landed on Mars. Millions of people on Earth watched as it's tiny rover, Sojourner, wandered over the planet's surface. Mars is the fourth planet from the sun. It is often called the Red Planet because it looks red from Earth. Mars looks red because its surface has lots of iron. The iron has rusted and turned a reddish-brown color. Sometimes, winds on Mars whip the reddish dust into the sky, turning the sky pink. A dust storm whips across the Martian surface. Dust storms often form in the Martian spring. A dust storm forms when high winds pick up sand and blow it across the surface. Large dust storms can last for months and blanket the entire planet with the red dust. Two dry riverbeds cut across the surface of Mars. Each riverbed is more than a half-mile deep. Scientists say the riverbeds formed when water suddenly gushed to the surface from inside Mars. The riverbeds might have formed billions of years ago, scientists say. Hundreds of dry riverbeds crisscross the Red Planet. Valles Marineris is the largest canyon on Mars. It is nearly 2,500 miles long and about 4 miles deep. On Earth, it would almost span the distance between New York City and Los Angeles. (The Grand Canyon on Earth is only 227 miles long and 1 mile deep!) The volcanoes on Mars are larger than volcanoes on Earth. The largest Martian volcano, is about the same size as Arizona at its base. Mars has ice caps at its north and south poles, much like Earth has. But Martian ice caps are made of water ice and frozen carbon dioxide, or dry ice. The polar ice caps grow in the winter and shrink in the summer. This photo shows the planet's south pole in summer.	3
Some people are afraid of horseshoe crabs. Their hard shells, pointy tails, and six pairs of legs make them scary-looking animals. But horseshoe crabs actually help people. Their special blue blood is used by doctors to help fight diseases. Now some scientists say the number of horseshoe crabs is falling, and they need our help. Scientists believe the horseshoe crab population around the world is falling--for many reasons. Fishermen catch horseshoe crabs and use them as bait. Pollution is hurting some of the areas in North America, from Maine to Mexico, where horseshoe crabs live. Seabirds hunt the crabs and eat the eggs that female horseshoe crabs lay. In the United States, some states are passing laws that say how many crabs can be caught each year. The U.S. government wants to make Delaware Bay, where many horseshoe crabs live, a protected area. Delaware Bay is near Virginia, Maryland, and Delaware. Horseshoe crabs help doctors fight diseases. Doctors use horseshoe crab blood to test medicines for harmful germs. Crab blood clots, or thickens, when it comes in contact with germs that can cause disease. If the crab blood does not clot, the medicine is free of bacteria, and people can safely use it. Doctors use a needle to remove some of the special blue blood from a crab. Blood is taken from about 300,000 horseshoe crabs each year. Scientists say that no horseshoe crabs are killed when the blood is taken. The horseshoe crabs are later returned to their habitat, or area where they live. Efforts are being made to help protect horseshoe crabs. Scientists warn it will take 20 to 30 years to see if the horseshoe crab population has increased. Scientists say horseshoe crabs were around when the dinosaurs lived. Why haven't horseshoe crabs become extinct?	3
Railroad tracks connecting Seoul and Pyongyang should be completed in September 2001. Seoul is South Korea's capital. Pyongyang is North Korea's capital. North Korea and South Korea are two countries in Asia. They have been officially at war for 47 years. Now, however, the countries seem to be making tracks toward peace. South Korean workers have begun rebuilding railroad tracks that will connect South Korea's capital with North Korea's capital. When complete, the tracks will connect the cities for the first time in 50 years. The two countries fought a war against each other from 1950 to 1953. The United States, China, and other countries also fought in the war. The war ended when North Korea and South Korea agreed to stop fighting. However, neither country signed a peace treaty. Since then, they have been enemies. Today, 2 million soldiers protect the border between North and South Korea.	3
"Scientists are studying a dead giant squid found near Australia in February. The giant squid weighs 550 pounds and is 36 feet long. The giant squid will be displayed at a museum in Melbourne. Melbourne is a city in southeast Australia. Giant squids live about 4,800 feet below the ocean surface. That's almost a mile down! A giant squid has eight arms and two tentacles. A tentacle is like an arm, except it is longer. Scientists know little about giant squids. One reason is that scientists have never seen one alive. Giant squids have been called ""monsters of the deep."" Why might that be?"	3
This year, no one has been able to catch Tiger Woods on the golf course. Woods set a record this year by becoming the fourth golfer in history to win the Grand Slam.	3
This summer, cats will try to take over the world. That's the plot, or story, of the upcoming summer movie Cats and Dogs. To tell the story, the film uses animals, puppets, and computer animation. Tobey Maguire and Susan Sarandon are among the actors whose voices will be used for the film's animals.	3
Koly is a young girl growing up in India. Because of a family tradition, Koly marries at age 13. Her husband soon dies, however, and Koly is forced to live on her own, far from her family and friends. You can read more of Koly's story in Gloria Whelan's book Homeless Bird. The book, written for children ages 8 and older, won the 2000 National Book Award for young people's literature.	3
The Galápagos Islands are a group of islands located in the Pacific Ocean off the coast of South America. The islands are home to some of the world's rarest, or most unusual, animals and plants. In January, those islands had a brush with disaster. On January 16, a ship carrying oil got stuck on a reef near the Galápagos Islands. (A reef is a chain of rocks or coral near the surface of the water.) The islands are located in the Pacific Ocean about 600 miles off the coast of Ecuador. Scientists say the oil spill put many of the islands' animals in danger. The oil spill happened near San Cristóbal and Santa Fe islands, in the eastern area of the Galápagos. Cleanup workers said the oil killed two pelicans and dirtied 40 others. Workers said some sea lions, birds, and tortoises also needed to be cleaned. Oil can make animals sick if they swallow it. When oil covers an animal's fur or feathers, it can't swim, fly, or stay warm. If the oil is not cleaned off the animal, it could die. The oil spill also harmed life in the water. Many sea plants, such as algae (AL-jee), were also damaged by the oil spill. Sea plants are an important food source for many Galápagos animals. Days after the accident, however, the islands were spared further damage. Ocean currents took the oil out to sea, away from the islands.	3
"Canada's ""hottest"" hotel is open for business. For about $150, you can stay at the only ice hotel in North America. All the furniture, including the beds, sofas, and light fixtures, is made of ice. The Ice Hotel is in Quebec City, in the province of Quebec. It is built of 4,500 tons of snow and 250 tons of ice. (A ton is equal to 2,000 pounds.) There are six guest rooms, with space for two to eight people in each room. The ice hotel will remain open until it melts, probably in early April."	3
The polar explorers both skied and used sails to cross Antarctica. Antarctica's strong winds helped the women drag their 250-pound sleds across the frozen land.	3
Each year, 17 million people try to stop smoking. However, only 1 million quit. That's why the American Cancer Society has organized The Great American Smokeout and SmokeScream. Mark next Thursday, November 16, on your calendars and get ready to scream. That is the day of the SmokeScream. It is a day when kids across the country can scream about the dangers of smoking. November 16 is also the day of the Great American Smokeout. The goal of the Smokeout is to get people to stop smoking for the day--and maybe forever. The SmokeScream and the Great American Smokeout is run by the American Cancer Society. The group helps fight cancer by teaching people about the illness and raising money for medical research. Cancer is an illness that can cause death. Doctors say that smoking can cause cancer and other illnesses that can kill. A disease caused by smoking is lung cancer. The lungs are parts of the body that allow a person to breathe. There is no cure for lung cancer. About 430,000 people die each year from illnesses caused by smoking. That is more than the total number of deaths each year resulting from AIDS, drug abuse, car accidents, murders, and fires.	3
"Robots can do some pretty amazing things! Now, a doctor in North Carolina is testing the use of robots in operations on the heart. ""We'll be able to perform operations with these robots that have never been imagined,"" said Dr. Randolph Chitwood of North Carolina. Dr. Chitwood is working to see whether robots can be used safely in operations to replace people's heart valves. During the new heart operation, a robot with three arms works at the operating table. A few feet away, a doctor controls the robot's arms with a computer. Three tiny holes are made in the patient's chest. The robot's arms fit through the small holes. One of the robot's arms holds a tiny camera. The camera allows the doctors to see inside the patient's body. The other two arms hold small tools, such as scissors and needles. Robots may help lower the risks of heart operations. A doctor's hand can sometimes shake slightly. Or sometimes, a doctor's hand can be too large to reach some areas of the heart. But a robot's arms do not shake and can fit into tiny places. Because the robot can work through small holes, the patient's chest heals faster after the operation."	3
"After 14 years in space, the Mir (pronounced MEER) space station will return to Earth soon. The Russian space station has become too expensive and dangerous to continue its mission. If you look up into the sky next month, you may catch a glimpse of Mir as it falls to Earth. Mir is the Russian word for ""peace."" But the end of the Mir space station will be anything but peaceful. On February 27 or 28, scientists in Russia plan to use remote control to steer Mir as it enters Earth's sky. They will try to send Mir into the Pacific Ocean, about 1,000 miles east of Australia. Most of the 130-ton spacecraft will burn up as it falls from space. The space station is being brought down because there is no money left to operate it. Some Russian officials had hoped to save the space station. They wanted to attach sections of Mir to the International Space Station (ISS). But U.S. space officials said that some parts of Mir are too old and damaged to use on the ISS. There have been many adventures aboard Mir. In 1997, a fire broke out, filling the spacecraft with smoke and dangerous fumes. Later that year, a supply ship crashed into Mir. The crash caused an oxygen loss on the station. Cosmonauts were forced to close off that section of Mir. Astronauts can take one personal item when they travel to space. What would you take with you to space?"	3
"As Ellen MacArthur crossed the finish line of the Vendee Globe race, she sailed right into the history books. MacArthur, aboard her sailboat called Kingfisher, set two world's records in the around-the-world race. The Vendee Globe is one of the world's toughest sailing races. Sailors must race nonstop around the world. And if that were not hard enough, all sailors must sail solo, or alone. Ellen MacArthur, a 24-year-old Englishwoman, finished second in the 2000 Vendee Globe. She sailed about 31,000 miles in 94 days, 4 hours, 25 minutes, 40 seconds. MacArthur finished only one day after the winner, Frenchman Michel Desjoyeaux. During the Vendee Globe voyage, MacArthur had to make repairs to her boat without losing time. She averaged ten naps a day, sleeping a total of just six hours a day. Once she awoke just in time to steer away from a giant iceberg looming 50 feet in front of her! Those difficulties were nothing compared to the one MacArthur said she faced at the finish line. ""My life is here, home is on board Kingfisher. I just adore being at sea, and to suddenly stop this will not be easy at all,"" she said. If you were to take a long trip by yourself, where would you go? How would you travel?"	3
One star, called HD 168443, is circled by two giant planets. Scientists believe one of those planets is 17 times larger than Jupiter. This planet is so huge, scientists are wondering if it really is a planet. Two planets also orbit the star Gliese 876. Scientists report that one of the planets orbits the star twice as fast as the other planet does. HD 168443 and its planets are 738,000,000,000,000 miles away from Earth. Gliese 876 and its planets are closer. They are just 90,000,000,000,000 miles away!	3
The day when pigs fly has finally come! In November, Charlotte, a 300-pound pig, flew on a passenger jet from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, to Seattle, Washington. Maria Tirotta Andrews said she had special permission from the airlines to have her pig fly with her. But airline officials are now saying that the pig should not have flown in the passenger section.

Otis is a type of dog called a boxer. Otis visits children in hospitals. Service dogs such as Otis are trained to help people in many ways. When Otis visits sick children in a hospital, he cheers them up! Doctors believe having dogs visit hospitals and nursing homes helps patients relax and feel better. Shadow is a border collie who has a job chasing birds! At Dover Air Force Base in Delaware, planes are damaged when they collide, or crash into, birds. By chasing birds away from the runways, Shadow helps planes land and take off safely. Firefighters and rescue teams train dogs to use their sense of smell to search for lost or injured people. The dogs help rescuers find people buried under rubble, or fallen building pieces, after earthquakes. A dog's nose has saved lives in other ways, too. During wars, dogs save soldiers' lives by sniffing out bombs and hidden enemy soldiers. Police dogs sniff out bombs, weapons, and illegal drugs. A dog's sense of smell is so strong that a dog can smell something half a mile away! Service dogs help out in homes as well. Dogs are being trained to help people with disabilities at home and at work. Trained dogs can open doors, pull heavy objects, carry tools, and even open and close an umbrella.	3
About 5,300 years ago, a man walked along a mountain path. He stopped to rest and set down his copper ax. The man died there. In time, his body froze in the mountain's ice and snow. Now, scientists are trying to solve the mysteries this frozen man left behind. In 1991, two climbers discovered a frozen body in the Ötztal (OETS-tahl) Mountains in Italy. Italy is a country in Europe. Scientists learned that the body was of a man who lived about 5,300 years ago. The ice had preserved his body, making it a mummy. In September, scientists thawed, or warmed, the body so they could study the man's remains. Scientists have nicknamed the mummy Ötzi, after the mountains where he was found. They have studied Ötzi's hair, teeth, skin, and clothes. So far, scientists have learned that Ötzi was probably a shepherd. He was wearing a grass cape, goatskin leggings, a bearskin cap, and fur-lined shoes. A theory, or guess, is that Ötzi was leading his herd of animals over the mountains when he died. When he is not being studied, Ötzi is kept in a special freezer in a museum in Italy. His body is kept frozen so it does not decay, or rot. Ötzi's remains are helping scientists learn how much the world has changed in 5,300 years. What might scientists learn about you if they studied your belongings?

Last month, U.S. Vice President Dick Cheney had an operation to open an artery. Arteries are tubes that carry blood from the heart through the body. Doctors opened the artery to help Cheney avoid a heart attack. A heart attack happens when the blood supply to the heart is reduced or stopped. The vice president has had four heart attacks, most recently last November. Back then, doctors treated Cheney by placing a stent in his artery. A stent is a small metal device that stops an artery from becoming clogged. During last month's operation, doctor's cleared away scar tissue that had grown around the stent.	3
Last September, scientists announced that an African monkey is now extinct, or is no longer living. Miss Waldron's red colobus monkey is the first monkey to become extinct in nearly 300 years. Scientists say the monkey is gone because of hunting and because people have destroyed much of the monkey's habitat, or natural home. The monkey lived in the rain forests of Ghana and Ivory Coast, two countries in the western part of Africa.	3

"To fans all over the world, Lance Armstrong is a bicycling superstar. He is also a hero to millions of people for a different kind of victory. Last July, Lance Armstrong won his second Tour de France, a 2,774-mile bicycle race through the country of France. People all over the world know him as a bicycling superstar. But Lance Armstrong is also known as a hero for his fight against cancer, a deadly illness. In 1996, at age 25, Armstrong had won many races around the world. His life changed that year when he found out he had cancer. Cancer is a disease that spreads through the body. But Armstrong was determined to beat the illness. ""I've always been a fighter,"" he said. Armstrong fought back by starting the Lance Armstrong Foundation, a charity to help people with cancer. He worked to tell people about the illness and how to stay healthy. A year later, doctors told Armstrong great news: He had beaten cancer. After surviving cancer, Armstrong returned to racing. In 1999, he won his first Tour de France. Armstrong said his victory proved that people can beat cancer. To many people with cancer, Armstrong became a hero. ""I hope it sends a fantastic message to survivors around the world,"" he said. Some critics say the Tour de France is the world's toughest sporting event. What do you think is the toughest sporting event?"	3

In 1971, President Richard Nixon set aside the third Monday in February as Presidents' Day. This day is meant to honor the birthdays of President Abraham Lincoln (February 12) and President George Washington (February 22). Some people observe the birthdays of all past presidents of the United States on Presidents' Day. This year, Presidents' Day is February 19. Including President George W. Bush, 42 people have been president of the United States. (President Grover Cleveland served two separate terms. He is counted as the 22nd and 24th president.) That means that the birthdays of 42 presidents can be remembered on Presidents' Day.	3
In November, astronauts began living aboard the International Space Station (ISS). People will be able to live in the space station for long periods of time. U.S. astronaut Bill Shepherd is the leader of the first ISS crew, which will stay four months.	3
This design shows how the inside of a section of the ISS will look. The top floor (1) will be the exercise and health area. The middle floor (2) will be the crew's sleeping area. The bottom floor (3) will be the cooking and dining area. Have you ever moved into a new neighborhood? Soon, astronauts and scientists will move into a neighborhood that is out of this world. Building the ISS is a project, or job, shared by 16 countries. The spacecraft will let astronauts and scientists carry out experiments and learn how humans can live in space for long periods of time. The station is being assembled, or put together, in space. U.S. space shuttles and Russian rockets are being used to carry tools and the pieces of the ISS into space. When completed, the ISS will be larger than a football field. Circling 240 miles above the Earth, the station will also be one of the brightest objects in the night sky.	3

Almost 136 years after it sank, the submarine H.L. Hunley has finally returned to the surface. In August, scientists and divers used a crane to raise the submarine which had sunk off the coast of South Carolina in 1864. The Hunley fought for the southern U.S. states during the Civil War. The Civil War lasted from 1861 to 1865. The war was between northern and southern U.S. states. The Hunley was the first submarine to sink an enemy ship during a battle. The Hunley sank just outside Charleston Harbor after it rammed a 22-foot harpoon, or spear, into the USS Housatonic. As the Hunley pulled away, a bomb attached to the harpoon exploded, causing the Housatonic to sink.	3
William Shepherd will command the first crew. That crew will include two Russian cosmonauts, Yuri Gidzenko and Sergei Krikalev. The crew members plan to spend four months aboard the ISS. They will connect other pieces and parts as those things arrive from Earth. Construction of the space station will not be completed until 2005 or 2006.	3
There was a time when all a backpack was used for was to carry school books and papers. But today, backpacks are being weighed down by many things, such as laptop computers, sneakers, CDs, and video games. Many doctors warn that heavy backpacks can lead to back and neck pain. Doctors say kids should wear backpacks high up on their backs. They recommend that a kid who weighs 50 pounds should not carry more than a 5-pound backpack.	3
"Ever since they were little girls, Liv Arnesen and Ann Bancroft have dreamed of adventure. Now the two women want to set a world's record by skiing across Antarctica. Imagine skiing across 2,400 miles of ice and snow. The freezing winds blow at 100 mile per hour as you pull a 250-pound supply sled. In November, former teachers Liv Arnesen and Ann Bancroft will try to become the first women to ski across Antarctica. The trek, or long journey, would set a world's record for the longest distance ever skied by women. But for Arnesen, age 46, and Bancroft, age 44, their Antarctic trek is also about following their childhood dreams. The message the polar explorers want people to know is that there are no barriers. ""The world is for all of us, and it is at our fingertips. Go get it,"" Bancroft said recently. Arnesen and Bancroft's trek will last from November to February. They will be crossing during Antarctica's summer months, when the average temperature is 30 degrees below zero! In 1994, Arnesen was the first woman to ski to the South Pole. In 1993, Bancroft became the only woman to reach both the North and South poles. What other faraway places like Antarctica would you like to explore?

"Scientists in Argentina have announced the discovery of a ""Jurassic Park."" Argentina is a country in South America. There, the fossils of pterodactyls (bottom left) and a large sauropod (bottom right) were found. Those dinosaurs lived during the middle Jurassic Period, about 165 million years ago. Scientists also found the fossils of turtles, and other dinosaurs."	3
Have you ever seen a shooting star? What you probably saw was a meteor. A meteor is a space rock that is burning as it passes from space into Earth's sky. Some meteors are pieces of larger space rocks known as asteroids. Recently, pieces of a space rock crashed into Canada. Scientists hope to learn more about our solar system by studying the pieces of rock. Last January, a 15-foot-wide, 400,000-pound meteor shot across the sky over Canada. It exploded in the air with the force of 3,000 tons of dynamite. More than 500 baseball-size meteorites have been found in Tagish Lake, Canada. Meteorites are pieces of a meteor that hit the ground. Canadian scientists are studying the remains of the meteor. They have discovered that the pieces are made of a rare material. By studying the material, the scientists believe they can learn more about how the solar system was formed. Some scientists believe that a large meteorite smashed into Earth about 65 million years ago, landing near the Gulf of Mexico. The meteorite created a crater, or hollow area in the ground. This crater is 190 miles wide, which is wider than any of the Great Lakes in North America. The meteorite's impact, or force at landing, hurled dust and rocks high into the sky. The dust, scientists say, blocked the sunlight from warming Earth. All living things need sunlight to survive. Without sunlight, most plants and animals, including dinosaurs, died. Most meteors come from asteroids. Asteroids are space rocks usually found between Mars and Jupiter. Meteorites hit Earth all the time. However, scientists have trouble finding meteorites. Why is it difficult for scientists to find meteorites? Send us an e-mail at Ed3@weeklyreader.com and let us know. The world map shows the sites of some meteorite craters. A crater is a hole made by a meteorite when it hits Earth.	3

"Scientists are rushing to uncover and protect ruins of some very old cities. Those scientists have found lost cities in Asia and Africa that are more than 2,000 years old! Thousands of years ago, enemy armies and natural disasters destroyed the cities of Zeugma and Herakleion (ee-RAH-klee-on). This summer, however, scientists known as archaeologists (ahr-kee-OL-uh-jists) discovered the lost cities. They found Zeugma in Turkey, a country in Asia. Other scientists found Herakleion underwater off the coast of Egypt, a country in Africa. About 2,000 years ago, Zeugma was an important meeting place for traders and soldiers. The ruins show that some of the homes had water pipes and mosaics. Zeugma is located near a dam on the Euphrates (yoo-FRAY-teez) River. The dam is needed to make electricity for people who live nearby. But the dam will cause the river to rise. Soon the river's water will cover part of Zeugma's ruins. Off the coast of Egypt, divers are finding the remains of Herakleion. Herakleion was built to honor Hercules, an ancient hero. Experts say Herakleion is at least 2,500 years old. They say an earthquake probably caused the city to sink into the Mediterranean Sea. Archaeologists have found the remains of houses, roads, temples, statues, and coins under 30 feet of water. ""It was really a lost world,"" said Franck Goddio, an archaeologist working on the site."	3
"Scientists have discovered a lost city, hidden under a thick curtain of jungle trees, plants, and vines. American Indians known as the Maya, who lived in Mexico and Central America, built the city in Guatemala. Scientists believe the city is more than 2,000 years old. The city is called Cancuén (KAN-ku-win), which means ""Place of the Serpent."" Cancuén, scientists say, was an important meeting place where people traded and sold goods."	3
1. Lungs--Smoking kills parts of the lungs that allow a person to breathe. It also causes illnesses, such as bronchitis and emphysema. 2. Heart--Smoking blocks vessels carrying blood to and from the heart. It can also lead to heart attacks.	3
"Scientists have been studying how much the ground beneath Machu Picchu has been sliding. In January, some Japanese scientists warned that if the ground continued to slide, a big landslide might destroy Machu Picchu. Experts have also warned that tourists visiting Machu Picchu are damaging the Inca ruins. In recent years, tourists have started small fires and have littered the Machu Picchu area. The government of Peru, however, disagreed with the warnings. ""Machu Picchu won't collapse,"" said one government official. The official said that Machu Picchu has lasted for more than 500 years. He added that he doesn't see why landslides or tourism would destroy the city anytime soon. The Incas built Machu Picchu sometime around 1460. The blocks used to build Machu Picchu were wedged so tightly together that a razor blade cannot fit between the stones. The ruins include about 200 stone buildings, including palaces, temples, and small homes. The Incas were a South American Indian people who ruled one of the largest and richest empires on the continent. By 1532, the Incas ruled an area that stretched for 2,500 miles along the west coast of South America. The Inca empire included parts of what are now Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Bolivia, Chile, and Argentina. The Incas were skilled in farming and in building stone structures and roads. They were also skilled craftspeople, making many fine gold and silver ornaments. They studied the stars and knew how to predict the seasons of the year."	3
Ferdinand Magellan led the first ships to sail around the world. The voyage, from 1519 to 1522, helped prove that Earth is round. Magellan led a crew of 241 sailors and a fleet, or group, of five ships. The voyage began in Spain on September 20, 1519. The fleet traveled across the Atlantic Ocean to South America. They sailed around that continent's coast until they reached the Pacific Ocean. Many men died during the journey because of illness or starvation. Storms destroyed some of the ships. Magellan himself was killed in a battle in the Philippines. The remaining crew and ships continued sailing toward Spain.	3

Last June, photographs taken of Mars by the Mars Global Surveyor spacecraft showed ditches on Mars. Scientists believe the ditches could have been made by flowing water. Scientists think the ditches were made when water seeped from underground. There is no water on the surface now. Scientists say it probably froze or turned to a mist. No one is sure when the ditches were created. They could be as old as a million years or as young as one week.	3
"The United States is sometimes called a ""melting pot."" It got this nickname because people from all over the world have come here to live. A recent government report says more people from Latin American and Asian countries are living in the United States than ever before. The Census Bureau's report shows that about 11 million Asian people live in the United States today. The report also says that 31 million Latin American people live in the United States. Latin American people are from the countries south of the United States in Central and South America. People emigrate, or move from their homeland to another country, for many reasons. Some people leave their homeland to be with family members. Other people emigrate because life in their homeland has become too hard or dangerous. More people also emigrate today because traveling to other countries is faster, less expensive, and safer than ever before. Many neighborhoods have signs and billboards written in other languages. How else might a neighborhood change with the arrival of people from other countries?"	3
A United States vice president is a heartbeat away from the most powerful position in the world. A vice president must be ready to become president if the current president dies or cannot finish his or her term in office. Fourteen vice presidents have become presidents in U.S. history. Only nine vice presidents have been elected as president. The last to do so was George H. W. Bush, the father of this year's Republican candidate, George W. Bush.	3
"This summer was the worst wildfire season in 50 years, according to the U.S. Forest Service. More than 6 million acres of forest and public lands were destroyed by wildfires. Many trees and plants were burned. Their roots can no longer hold the soil in place. Much soil is in danger of being washed away. Workers are planting seeds in the burned areas and covering the soil with mats. The mats will keep the dirt and soil from washing away. ""Nature is going to heal,"" said a U.S. Forest Service official. States such as Idaho, Utah, and Montana suffered the worst wildfires."	3

"Asian elephants are running out of space and time. Their habitat, or the place where they usually live, has been shrinking. Scientists warn that Asian elephants could disappear if nothing is done to help them. In Asia, humans and elephants are fighting over land. The forests where many elephants live are being cut down by loggers. The land that elephants live on is also being turned into farms. Many elephants have been killed when they cross into farms looking for food. Scientists say the fight for land between elephants and humans is hurting both sides. Elephants kill around 300 people each year in India. In the last ten years, the elephant population in Vietnam has dropped from about 2,000 to fewer than 100. Scientists for the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) say there are about 35,000 to 50,000 Asian elephants left in the wild. That is a decline, or drop, from the 100,000 Asian elephants that were in the wild in 1900. The map shows Asian countries. Elephants in these countries, scientists warn, are in danger of becoming extinct, or dying out. Most males have tusks. If present, female tusks are small. The WWF is an organization that works to save endangered animals. According to a recent WWF report, many Asian elephants are being killed for their meat, skin, and ivory tusks. Elizabeth Kemf, a WWF scientist, says that world governments should set aside land for Asian elephants. Efforts to save the Asian elephants are important, she says, because the elephants belong ""not only to Asia, but all the world's people."" More people live in Asia than on any other continent. How might that affect the Asian elephant population?"	3

On January 15, people all over the country will celebrate Martin Luther King Jr. Day. It is a day for people to celebrate his life. It is also a day for people to remember how Martin Luther King Jr. worked to make sure laws protect the rights of all Americans. Now a memorial is going to be built in Washington, D.C., to honor King. A memorial is a special statue or place that honors a person or an event. King's memorial will sit on 4 acres of land. That's about the same size as three football fields. This is a map of a section of Washington, D.C. Located in this area are several sites honoring important Americans. Workers will probably start building the memorial this year. It will be built between the memorials to President Abraham Lincoln and President Thomas Jefferson. They plan to finish the memorial by 2003. A special event in American history took place near where the new memorial will be built. On August 28, 1963, King gave a speech before about 250,000 people. King and the people were in Washington, D.C., to speak out for freedom and better laws to protect all Americans. That speech is known as the ""I Have a Dream"" speech. Martin Luther King Jr. is remembered for being a powerful speaker and a leader for peace. He taught others that problems can be solved peacefully, rather than through fighting and violence."	3
"Congress approved a national park in October to celebrate the women who helped build ships and make equipment used during World War II. The war lasted from 1939 to 1945. The new Rosie the Riveter park is located in Richmond, California. More than 6 million women worked in shipyards, steel mills, and factories during the war. Women workers were nicknamed ""Rosie the Riveter."" A riveter is a worker who uses a rivet, or big metal pin, to join two pieces of metal together. The United States and other countries fought against Germany, Japan, and Italy in World War II. Many U.S. women chipped in to win the war. Those women worked at jobs that needed to be filled when Americans went off to fight."	3
The clock shows five seconds left in the game. Your team is losing by just one goal. You want to take the ball and score a goal. But you are cheering from the sidelines because you injured your leg. According to doctors, however, many sports injuries can be prevented. Each year, about 20 million kids play sports during and after school. Unfortunately, about 5 million of those kids suffer some kind of injury while playing. During April, the foundation plans to teach kids about sports safety. The foundation's message is that most sports injuries can be prevented. The NYSSF says that playing sports and exercising help kids stay healthy and make friends. But no matter which sport you play, always remember to have fun!	3

In December, a government agency issued a recall of, or an order to return, 100,000 scooters. The report warned that the handlebars on two scooters, Kent Kickin' Mini Scooters and Racer X20, could break.	3
The next United States president can get some decorating tips from John Zweifel. That is because for the past 40 years, Zweifel has been building a small model of the White House. His model is so exact, it even includes the roller-skating marks left on the floor by President Jimmy Carter's daughter, Amy. The model is 60 feet long and 20 feet wide. It is on display in a Washington, D.C., museum. The replica, or copy, allows people to view rooms not open to the public in the real White House tour. Zweifel redecorates the model each time a president moves into the White House.	3
Launched into space on May 14, 1973, Skylab was America's first permanent space station. Skylab was four stories high and weighed about 100 tons. It had room for only three U.S. astronauts. In the fall of 1977, strong storms on the sun lowered Skylab's orbit around Earth. Unable to repair the spacecraft, NASA officials decided to bring Skylab back to Earth. On July 11, 1979, the empty Skylab returned in a controlled crash. But during its return, Skylab broke apart. Some large pieces landed in Australian areas where people lived. Luckily, no one was injured. The rest of Skylab landed harmlessly in the Indian Ocean.	3
Asian swamp eels are no ordinary eels. They are fierce hunters. They can live on land and in the water. Now scientists are worried that the eels may take control of Everglades National Park in Florida. The eels came from Vietnam, a country in Asia. Scientists believe someone accidentally released some of the eels in waters near the park. The eels feed on the plants and animals that many Everglades animals eat to survive. Scientists hope to catch the eels before they reach the park's waters. They plan to stun the eels with an electric stick and then catch them with nets.	3

A new section was recently added to the International Space Station (ISS). The ISS is a spacecraft that orbits about 225 miles above Earth. This drawing shows the inside of the Destiny module, or spacecraft. Scientists conduct experiments in the laboratory. The new section is called Destiny. It was taken to the ISS by the U.S. space shuttle Atlantis. Astronauts and scientists will perform experiments, or tests, aboard Destiny. One experiment will test how humans can live in space for long periods of time. Destiny is 28 feet long and 14 feet wide, about the size of a school bus. Destiny weighs 16 tons and cost $1.4 billion to build.	3
Holy cow! Strange cows have been appearing in several cities in the United States. The cows are actually statues. They are part of a festival called Cowparade 2000. Local artists or schoolchildren in the cities decorated the statues. The statues will later be sold to raise money for local charities.	3
"Taylor Momsen is the actress who plays Cindy-Lou Who in the movie version of the Dr. Seuss story ""How the Grinch Stole Christmas."" Taylor wanted to adopt the dog that played Max in the movie. But Taylor's parents would not let her have a pet. Instead, Taylor decided to help dogs in her hometown, St. Louis, Missouri. She learned that the Humane Society, a group that cares for homeless pets, needed towels to keep animals dry and warm. Taylor collected 100 towels, sheets, and blankets in her neighborhood to donate to the Humane Society."	3
"You can say that Mario Lemieux, of the Pittsburgh Penguins, owns the ice in two ways. First, he is one of the greatest hockey players to ever play the game. But he is also the only player in history to play for a team he also owns. In his first game in three years, Mario Lemieux (le-MEW) reminded hockey fans why he is called ""Super Mario."" He scored a goal and led his team to victory. Lemieux retired in 1997 at age 31. People usually retire, or stop working, when they reach age 65 or older, or because of serious illness or injury. Some people retire when they have earned enough money to live on for the rest of their lives. Lemieux came out of his retirement last December. Since 1991, injuries and illnesses forced Lemieux to quit playing three other times. But each time he returned to play, he came back stronger and faster. In 1991 and 1992, Lemieux led his team to two Stanley Cups. The Stanley Cup is the trophy given to the National Hockey League's championship team. In 1999, Lemieux bought the Pittsburgh Penguins team. He is the only athlete in sports history to both own and play for a professional sports team."	3
Martin has a rare blood disease that makes it painful for him to walk. Martin says he must use a cart to play golf. The PGA argues that a cart gives Martin an advantage over other golfers. Unless Martin plays without using a cart, he cannot play in tournaments, PGA officials say.	3
"The days of stinky feet are over. Gang Sun, a scientist, has invented a smell-free sock. The sock's fibers are made with bits of chlorine. Chlorine is a chemical used to kill bacteria. Bacteria are tiny germs that you can see only with a microscope. Bacteria cause socks to smell. In the new socks, the chlorine kills any odor-causing bacteria. A cross-country running team tested the socks. ""After running 9 miles, not having socks smell of feet is a real bonus,"" said one runner. Sun hopes hospitals can use his odor-free fibers. The special fibers can kill bacteria in sheets, towels, and medical gowns."	3
"Fresh from their latest concert tour, the band 'N Sync has hit the studios to record a new album. ""I just think we have to get creative again, come out with a new style,"" said band member JC Chasez."	3
1. Talk to your parents about anything. 2. Be honest and patient when talking to your parents. 3. Listen to your parents. They might know things you didn't think they would know. 4. Be ready to talk to your parents any day, anytime. 5. Talk with your parents as often as you need to.	3
According to scientists, the ice sheet covering Greenland is melting. The melting ice, scientists warn, could raise sea levels and increase temperatures around the world. National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) scientists used satellites and lasers to measure the ice covering Greenland. The data, or facts, showed the ice has been melting at a rate of 3 feet a year. The water from the melting ice could flood coastal areas and cities on some continents. Some scientists blame the melting on global warming, an increase in temperatures around the world. Global warming is probably caused by the greenhouse effect. The greenhouse effect happens when air pollution created by cars and factories traps the sun's heat close to Earth.	3
"It's not easy being a kid. That's what a recent national survey of kids and parents revealed. Bullying and violence at school are just some of the problems facing many kids today. How can kids cope with such tough issues? ""Tough issues are facing kids at younger ages,"" said Tina Hoff of the Kaiser Family Foundation. The group is a children's health organization. The foundation, Children Now (a children's research group), and Nickelodeon asked children ages 8 to 15 and parents to point out the tough issues kids deal with every day. The survey found that when parents talk early about tough issues, kids learn to trust them more. Those kids who learn to talk to parents learn how to deal with problems that bother them."	3
On Halloween eve in 1938, radio listeners heard that Martians had invaded New Jersey! A radio news program broadcast the president of the United States warning that Earth was being invaded. Many people believed the program to be true and were scared. The invasion turned out to be a hoax, or trick, however. The news program was a radio play written to sound like a news report. The play was based on a popular science fiction book, The War of the Worlds. Orson Welles, an actor and director, presented the book's story as a news report to make it more exciting.	3
"In 1948, Thomas Dewey and Harry S. Truman were in a close race to become the next U.S. president. Many people predicted that Truman would lose to Dewey. A newspaper published a story about the election before all the votes had been counted. The headline said ""Dewey Defeats Truman."""	3
"Hi! My Name Is Pam Pollster. This is my pet parakeet, Polly. We live in Polling Place. Polly is a smart bird. In fact, she's so smart, she can count very high numbers. This is good, because I need Polly's help--and yours--with a problem. The problem is that Polling Place needs a new motto. The one we have now is kind of lame. Want to hear it? ""Polling Place. Live Here. It's Nice."" I told you it was lame. That's why we need a new motto. The town council came up with three choices. Now, it's up to Polly and me to find out which choice people like best. How are Polly and I going to find out everyone's opinion? It won't be easy. A few thousand people live in Polling Place. We sure don't have the time to go to every person's house to find out which motto he or she likes. (Besides, my bike has a flat tire and my in-line skates don't fit.) So what should we do? Well, Polly came up with a great idea. We can poll the people of Polling Place! (Told you she was smart.) A poll is a way of asking a small part of a large group of people what they think. Then, using math, you can figure out what the larger group is thinking. Polls are used all the time. In fact, they are really important during elections. (You know, the big thing that's on the news all the time?) Polls are also used to help the government, businesses, and organizations make decisions or plans. So, what is the first step for our motto poll of Polling Place? Keep reading to find out! Believe it or not, polling has been around for a long time in the United States. One of the first political polls was done in 1824! In those days, newspapers asked readers to write in saying the person they liked for president. One newspaper did a poll that said Andrew Jackson would be president. But Jackson didn't get enough votes to win. John Quincy Adams won that election and became our seventh president. Why was the newspaper wrong? The biggest problem was that only the readers of that one newspaper took part in the poll. It did not show what all people in the U.S. felt. By the 1960s, polling became more scientific. Such a scientific poll was used by John F. Kennedy during the 1960 presidential election. The poll, done by Louis Harris, figured out what issues people were worried about. For a poll to be scientific, three things must happen. Get a sample. The people who run a poll need to get a sample of people. A sample is a small part of a larger group of people. A sample for a poll must include ALL types of people, like boys and girls, young and old. Also, no one can know who is going to get picked for a poll's sample. And no one can volunteer to take part in a poll. Figure it out. Finally, experts, sometimes with the help of math, study the data, or people's answers. Then they put the data into charts so that it is easier for everyone to understand. So how did Polly and I poll the people of Polling Place? Here's how we did it. Step 1. The first step was to figure out the subject of the poll. That was easy! We wrote down the following on a piece of paper: Step 2. The tough part of polling is figuring out how to ask people our questions and get their answers. One way is to send people out to ask our questions. Another is to call people on the telephone. The Internet is also another way of polling. Polly and I decided to go out and ask a sample of all kinds of people. Step 3. We now have our data from the people of Polling Place! Next we will put it together into a chart (below). So what's the result? Which motto did the people of Polling Place like best?"	3

Being a U.S. president is one of the most important jobs in the world. But what does a president do after he finishes his term? Many presidents have had interesting jobs after they left the White House. John Quincy Adams, the sixth U.S. president, served as a representative in Congress. Jimmy Carter, the 39th president, helped start a charity organization, Habitat for Humanity, which helps build houses for people all over the world.	3

"The United States wrestling team is headed for the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney, Australia. ""Stone Cold"" Steve Austin and The Rock will not be there. Instead, amateur athletes, such as Terry Brands and Cary Kolat, will go for Olympic gold. Real Wrestling. Real Heroes. That is the motto, or slogan, of this year's Olympic wrestling team. The wrestlers use this motto because they are proud to wrestle for their country. They want people to know that the competition of Olympic wrestling is tougher than the professional wrestling of Mankind and Shane McMahon. In the Olympic Games, there are two styles of wrestling, Greco-Roman and freestyle. In Greco-Roman, wrestlers can use only their arms and upper body. In freestyle, wrestlers can use their legs to trip their opponent. Unlike pro wrestling, the two challengers wrestle on a padded mat, not in a ring with ropes. They use certain moves to force their opponent to the mat. Greg Strobel, a U.S. Olympic wrestling coach, says pro wrestling is meant to entertain. He says it is not a sport, like Olympic wrestling. Chris Benoit and the Undertaker are two famous pro wrestlers. Many fans enjoy pro wrestling because of the action, fireworks, and costumes. However, pro wrestling is more of a show than a real contest, said Ron Buck, a sports reporter. According to many critics, the moves and punches in a professional match are fake. U.S. Olympic wrestlers do not get paid to compete in the Olympics. For many team members, the chance to win a gold medal is a dream come true. Though pro wrestlers get more fame and attention, Olympic wrestlers consider representing the United States an honor. That is why, to many fans, these wrestlers are real heroes. Olympic wrestlers compete only against others who are in the same weight class. Why is that an important rule?"	3
Today, many people call 9-year-old Brandon Lecher a hero. When he saw his friend Joseph Dettwiler choking, Brandon knew how to save his friend's life. He knew how to help because he read a story in Weekly Reader! On October 4, Brandon Lecher used the Heimlich maneuver to save the life of his friend, Joseph Dettwiler. The Heimlich maneuver is a method, or way, to save someone from choking. It is named after Dr. Henry Heimlich, the doctor who invented the method in 1974. Weekly Reader recently spoke with both boys, who attend Greenville Elementary School in Greenville, Wisconsin. Brandon Lecher: I saw Joseph choking on a potato chip. His face was turning blue, and he was holding his throat. That's when I did the Heimlich maneuver. I was scared, but I remembered what to do. BL: I read it in Weekly Reader last year. It just came to my mind. When my class read it, it sounded like an interesting subject. WR: Do you like being a hero? What do your parents think? BL: It feels good. My parents are proud of me. They took me out for ice cream. JD: I learned that you should chew your food slowly, not fast. And if you're choking, you should point to your throat. That way, people around you know that you need help. BL: I learned that everyone should learn the Heimlich maneuver. You might have to use it on somebody. Do you know someone who is a hero? What does someone do in order to be called a hero? 3 - Grab your fist with the other hand. Press it in with an upward motion. Repeat this until the victim stops choking.	3

Back in November, Mandara, a 19-year-old western lowland gorilla, had a baby at the National Zoo in Washington, D.C. But for months, zookeepers could not tell whether her infant was a boy or a girl. Mandara was holding her infant so tightly that no one could get close enough to find out! Zookeepers have now solved the mystery: It's a boy! The baby boy weighed 4 or 5 pounds at birth. When he reaches adult size, he will weigh about 450 pounds! Zookeepers have not yet named the infant gorilla. The newborn's father is Kuja, an 18-year-old male. Mandara's family also includes Kigali, a 7-year-old female; Ktembe, a 4 1/2 year old male; and Kwame, a 2-year-old male. Scientists at the National Zoo are excited about the birth. Western lowland gorillas are among the most endangered animals on Earth. That means they are in danger of dying out completely. According to the World Wildlife Fund, about 111,500 gorillas currently live in the wild.	3
"Secrets about the past lie deep below the surface of the sea. In January, explorers reported their discovery of an ancient Greek ship on the bottom of the Black Sea. The Black Sea is located between Europe and Asia. Scientists say the ship is about 2,400 years old! ""The Greeks went into the Black Sea for fish and gold,"" said Robert Ballard, the explorer whose team found the wreck. Ballard is the same explorer who discovered the Titanic. Ballard said the ship in the Black Sea was used for trade. The ship was filled with jars. At one time, the jars held items such as fish, olive oil, and honey. This summer Ballard's team plans to dig up the shipwreck. They are hoping to learn more secrets about the ancient world."	3
The Asian rhino looks like a tank. The animal looks as though nothing could hurt it. But the Asian rhino is in danger of dying out, or becoming extinct. Three kinds of Asian rhinos are left in the wild--the Sumatran rhino, the Javan rhino, and the Indian rhino. All are in danger. Officials with the World Wildlife Fund say nearly 100 Asian rhinos have been killed in the past four years. Most of those rhinos were killed in Nepal and India. Both countries are located in Asia. Today, fewer than 3,000 Asian rhinos are left in the wild. Poachers are the main threat to Asian rhinos. Poachers are hunters who kill animals illegally. They kill the rhinos to make medicines. Some people in Asian countries believe that the rhino's horn and other body parts can cure diseases. Poaching is not the only threat facing the Asian rhino. People are building houses and farms on the land where rhinos live. They are also cutting down trees in those areas. The area where an animal lives is called its habitat. However, there is some hope for the survival of Asian rhinos. Officials in many Asian countries are trying to protect the rhinos. About 100 years ago, only a dozen Asian rhinos lived in Kaziranga National Park in India. Today nearly 1,500 Asian rhinos live there. •The Sumatran rhino's horn is longer than the horn on other Asian rhinos. The horn can grow to 31 inches. •The Indian rhino can weigh more than any other Asian rhino. It can weigh up to 6,000 pounds.	3
How much weight do you carry in your backpack? In October, we asked kids to answer that question. The good news is this: Most of you are not overloaded. The average backpack weighed 7 pounds. But some weighed more than 15 pounds! Ouch! Doctors advise kids not to carry too much weight in their backpacks. They say most third graders should not carry a backpack that weighs more than about 8 pounds.	3
"Many kids are familiar with the story of Pinocchio, the wooden puppet who turns into a real boy. The original Pinocchio story was written in 1881 by Carlo Collodi. In an upcoming movie, The New Adventures of Pinocchio, the plot has a twist. Pinocchio is turned back into a puppet. The movie is being shown on HBO Family this month and will come out on video and DVD in April. Gabriel Thomson plays the role of Pinocchio. During filming, he had to keep up with his schoolwork. ""I had a couple of tutors for different subjects,"" said Gabriel, who is now 16. His favorite subject is science, but he still likes drama. Gabriel encourages kids who are interested in acting to take part in school plays. Gabriel was 12 years old when he worked on the movie. ""It was incredible. It's a great part to play,"" he said."	3
"Each year, a special award is given to a person or group of people who work for peace. The award is called the Nobel Peace Prize. The first peace prize was given more than 100 years ago. This year, Jimmy Carter, a former U.S. president, won the award. Carter was president from 1977 to 1981. Later, he founded the Carter Center. The former president works with the Carter Center to bring about peace and to help poor people all over the world. The Nobel Peace Prize comes with 1 million dollars. ""The money will almost all go to the Carter Center,"" said Carter. Carter is the third U.S. president to win the Nobel Peace Prize. The other two presidents were Woodrow Wilson and Theodore Roosevelt."	3
"Erik Weihenmayer likes adventure. He is a scuba diver, biker, runner, sky diver, skier, and mountain climber. He is also blind. Erik recently became the first blind person to climb the Seven Summits. A summit is the top of a mountain. The Seven Summits are the highest peaks on each of the seven continents. At age 13, a rare eye disease caused Erik to go blind. He started mountain climbing three years later. He is now one of about 100 athletes who have climbed the Seven Summits. In what ways would your life be different if you were blind? In what ways would it be the same? In 1995, Erik started climbing the Seven Summits. He was 26 years old at the time. In September, he climbed the seventh summit, Mount Kosciuszko in Australia. To prepare for the climbs, Erik spent more than 1,000 hours training each year. He walked on a treadmill every day. He also climbed stairs wearing a 100-pound pack on his back. Erik climbs with the help of a team of climbers. He uses tracking poles to help him feel his way to the top of each mountain. ""I can't use my eyes, so I use my hands and my feet to feel what I'm doing,"" said Erik. The mountains that Erik climbed are all different. Some are rocky. Others are covered in snow and ice. Although he cannot see, Erik can use his other senses to tell each mountain apart. ""My senses--the feel of the rock, the smell of the earth, the sound of the wind howling--are what make each mountain different and unique for me,"" he said."	3
"Are you tired of looking at the same old coins? Some coin collectors say the penny, nickel, dime, and half dollar need a new look. They want the U.S. Mint to change the images on those coins. ""It would be great to have change in our pocket change. It is long overdue,"" said coin expert Donn Pearlman. Coin experts suggest using images such as heroes or animals on coins. It would not be the first time coins have been changed. For example, since 1999, quarters have been updated with new images. Those images honor the history of the 50 states. Officials at the U.S. Mint say that people really like the new quarters. ""Money is history you can hold in your hand,"" said coin collector Steve Bobbitt. If some people get their way, coins may soon tell a different history."	3
"Many underwater creatures live in coral reefs. Now scientists say the reefs are in danger. Off the coast of Florida, scientists are on a mission. They dive 35 feet to the ocean floor. There they check to see if a coral reef has been damaged. A coral reef is an underwater structure. It is built by thousands of tiny sea animals. Those animals are called coral polyps. Coral reefs are important to ocean life. The reefs are home to thousands of species, or kinds, of sea creatures. ""If you didn't have the reefs, you wouldn't have the fish or the pretty sponges or soft corals that wave back and forth,"" said scientist Richard Dodge. Coral polyps create hard skeletons around themselves. The skeletons form coral reefs. The skeletons are made of calcium. Calcium is the same thing that makes up your skeleton! When coral polyps die, they leave behind their skeletons. Young polyps attach themselves to the old skeletons. Coral reefs face many threats. Millions of tourists visit coral reefs every year. People kill corals by simply touching them. Ships that drop anchors on the reefs can damage them. Other threats include storms, pollution, and disease. Scientists want to make the public aware of the threat to coral reefs. They are using the report on coral reefs to do just that. ""It's a valuable tool for raising public awareness about the global decline of these unique treasures,"" said government official Craig Manson."	3
"When Dan Shaw and Cuddles go out, they attract quite a crowd. At first glance, Cuddles may look like a guide dog. But she is actually a miniature guide horse! Cuddles and Shaw, who is blind, have been together since 2001. As a guide horse, Cuddles leads Shaw wherever he needs to go. Cuddles wears tiny sneakers that prevent her from slipping. The Guide Horse Foundation in North Carolina trained Cuddles. She responds to more than 25 voice commands, including ""wait"" and ""door."" ""We are a good team,"" said Shaw."	3
Historians have found an old well in Virginia. The well was used as a dump after it went dry. Recently, the historians found an old piece of armor in the well. The old armor came from the earliest English settlers. The historians hope that the armor will help them learn more about the settlers' lives. The old well is located where the Jamestown fort used to be. On April 26, 1607, a group of settlers from England landed in Virginia. After exploring the area, they built a fort. They called the fort Jamestown. Jamestown was the first permanent English town in North America. The historians hope that the well at Jamestown contains other things that the settlers threw away. The objects, or artifacts, from the well are important. They can help historians understand what life was like in the fort. The historians hope the well will fill their thirst for knowledge about the United States during colonial times.	3
"Scientists recently made an unusual discovery in China. They found fossils of a 128-million-year-old dinosaur that had four wings! You might guess that this creature could fly. But scientists don't believe that to be true. Instead, they think the dinosaur used its feathered wings to glide from tree to tree. Scientists say the dinosaur may be related to birds. One scientist said it might have been ""the weirdest creature in the world of dinosaurs and birds."""	3
Earth Day inspires people to take action and help the environment. Many people will be spreading the message that the Earth needs to be cared for year-round. Kids around the world will participate in Earth Day events. Some will clean up parks. Others will plant trees. What do you plan to do on Earth Day to help the environment? One way to protect the Earth is to reduce pollution. Pollution occurs when people harm the air, land, and water. Most air pollution comes from the burning of fuels, such as oil, coal, and gas. The fuel is used to run cars and heat homes. Water and land pollution often come from chemicals and garbage. Some Earth-friendly inventions help reduce pollution. These inventions conserve, or use fewer, energy and natural resources such as water. Take a look at some of these exciting inventions. What exactly is an Earthship? An Earthship is actually not a ship at all. It is a house built to save energy and water. Earthships use solar power from the sun for heat and electricity. Earthships are made from recycled material. Old tires, aluminum soda cans, and glass bottles are some common materials used to build Earthships. Many people who live in Earthships also recycle their water. When it rains, they collect and filter the rainwater. The filter makes the water safe to use for drinking, washing, and cooking. The leftover water is saved for other uses, such as watering indoor plants.	3
Do you know your family history? A new Web site is helping people learn more about their family histories. The site recently posted information from the 1880 U.S. Census. A census is a count of the number of people. Ages, jobs, and other information are also recorded in a census. The 1880 U.S. Census counted about 50 million people, including many famous people. One of those people was inventor Thomas Alva Edison. To learn more about the U.S. Census, go to our Web site at www.weeklyreader.com/kids/grade3.	3
"Third grader Ian Oaks does not need to bring his lunch money to school. To pay for lunch, all he needs is his fingerprint. Ian is a student at Parker Memorial School in Tolland, Connecticut. Recently, the school came up with a new way for kids to pay for lunch. The school put a special machine in the lunchroom. The machine is a scanner that reads fingerprints! Students simply place a finger on the scanner. ""Then your name shows up on the computer for the lunch lady to see,"" Ian said. The scanner keeps track of the cost so parents can pay for the lunches. ""I like it because you don't have to take any money out of your pocket,"" said Ian. School officials bought the machine so kids could move faster through the lunch line. ""The new system is quicker. There is no doubt about it,"" said Principal Bob Lincoln."	3
In the future, a fly on the wall may really be a robot! Scientists in California are developing a tiny flying robot. The flying robot is so small that scientists have to pick it up with tweezers. Scientists are modeling the robot after a fly. They say flies are amazing insects. Flies can land upside down on the ceiling. They can fly backward. Flies can even turn faster than fighter jets! Scientists say the flying robot will have many uses. For example, a tiny camera could be placed on the robot. Soldiers could then use the robot to spy on enemy troops.	3
"Purple ketchup! Blue fries! Pink margarine! If you think food is getting more colorful, you are right. Some companies are giving foods colorful makeovers to make meals more fun. Scientists asked a group of 24 kids to try the foods. Most of the kids liked what they ate. But some parents refuse to let their kids eat the foods. ""They're so fake,"" said one mother. Food expert Julie Albrecht says, ""As far as safety goes, there is not an issue. They just don't look like the usual product."" The next time you are in the grocery store, see how many new colors you can count."	3
"Stacey Hillman is an amazing 12-year-old! She is the president of her own charity. charities help people and animals in need. Stacey's charity is called Pennies to Protect Police Dogs. She spends her free time raising money to buy bulletproof vests to protect police dogs. ""[Police dogs] are often the ones to go in first to dangerous situations,"" Stacey said. This September, Stacey was honored for her hard work. She received the 2002 Prudential National Spirit of Community Award. Over the past few years, Stacey and her charity have won many other awards. ""I don't do this for the awards. I do it so that the police dogs get vested,"" said Stacey. So far, Stacey has raised about 175,000 dollars. The money has been used to buy vests for more than 200 dogs across the United States! Stacey was just 9 years old when she started her charity, Pennies to Protect Police Dogs. She invites all kids to help buy vests for police dogs. You can find out more about Stacey's charity at her Web site: www.penniestoprotectpolicedogs.org."	3
"Not long ago, Judy Leden ran down a hill with large wings on her back. As she ran, the wings lifted her into the sky. Her flight lasted 17 seconds. The wings on Leden's back were part of a glider. A glider is an aircraft that does not have an engine. Leden's glider was based on a drawing made by Leonardo da Vinci about 500 years ago. Da Vinci was an Italian artist and inventor. After landing the historical glider, Leden declared, ""[The flight] was very, very thrilling."""	3
This year is the 50th anniversary of the Korean War. The Korean War started when North Korea invaded South Korea. Both countries are in Asia. Many ceremonies will honor veterans of the Korean War. Those veterans helped South Korea fight the war between 1950 and 1953. Special Veterans Day services will be held at Arlington National Cemetery in Virginia. Many U.S. veterans are buried in that cemetery. People are also making plans for ceremonies in cities and towns all across the country. Many people will attend those services to honor our American veterans.	3
"What will you be doing on January 20? Millions of Americans will be spending the day honoring Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. On January 20, a group of kids and their families in Palmetto, Florida, will be doing a service project. Their goal is to clean up an old cemetery to make it beautiful again. Thousands of other kids will also do special projects in their cities and towns. Those acts of kindness will honor Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. (1929-1968). King was a leader who spoke out against the unfair treatment of black people in the United States. When King was growing up in the South, black people were forced to sit in the back seats of buses. They had to use separate drinking fountains from those of white people. Many black children could not go to the same schools that white children went to. On August 28, 1963, Martin Luther King Jr. gave a speech in Washington, D.C. In the speech, King said, ""I have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin, but by the content of their character. I have a dream today."" King devoted his life to making the United States a better place. He believed that Americans should work to improve the lives of others. ""Everybody can be great because everybody can serve,"" King said. What are some ways you can help others? Why is helping important? Martin Luther King Jr. Day was first observed as a national holiday in 1986. It is celebrated each year on the third Monday in January. By helping others on Martin Luther King Jr. Day, kids and adults honor his dream for a better country."	3
"Just five more minutes!"" ""I'm tired!"" ""I can't get up."" If you have ever had trouble getting up in the morning, you are not alone. A new report says many U.S. kids do not get enough sleep. Your body needs sleep and lots of it! ""Evidence shows that elementary-age children need at least nine hours of sleep per night,"" said sleep expert Dr. Carl Hunt. Not sleeping enough can also affect kids' safety. Experts say children who are tired are more likely to suffer injuries. Lots of kids lose sleep because they are busy. Many take part in after-school activities. Then they go home, eat dinner, and do homework. Afterward, many kids watch TV, play video games, and surf the Internet. That leaves less time for sleep. Sometimes you may not be able to go to bed early. But, if you get a choice whether to stay up late, think twice. A good night's sleep can help you feel your best! Along with sleep, what other things are important for your health? Why?"	3
The celebration is planned to begin on January 18 at Monticello. Monticello was Thomas Jefferson's home in Virginia. Jefferson was the third U.S. president. In 1803, Jefferson bought a huge piece of land from France. The land doubled the size of the United States. Jefferson sent Lewis and Clark to explore the land. They led a team of men across thousands of miles. Along the way, they met many Native Americans. They also found animals they had never seen before. The team returned home in 1806 and told amazing tales of what they had seen.	3
"When people think of lightning, they generally picture it as a single bolt. However, scientists have recently reported that one flash of lightning often strikes in more than one place. It is common for lightning to fork, or split, and strike in two or more places, scientists say. Lightning is a flow of electricity. A flash of lightning can heat the air around it to up to 60,000 degrees Fahrenheit. That is about five times hotter than the sun! When lightning heats the air around it, the air expands and makes a loud crashing sound-thunder. If you hear thunder, you are within striking distance of lightning. ""Anytime you hear thunder, you should immediately move to a safe area,"" said scientist E. Philip Krider. Safe places include a school, house, or car. While it is unusual for people to be struck by lightning, it does happen. According to the National Weather Service, lightning causes nearly 300 injuries and 100 deaths in the United States each year. Watching a lightning storm may be exciting, but it can also be dangerous. Just keep in mind the power of nature and watch from a safe place indoors. 1. Try to find shelter in a car or building. 2. Avoid water, high places, and open spaces. 3. Do not stand near tall trees. 1. Do not use a corded telephone. Lightning can strike phone lines. 2. Stay away from windows and doors. 3. Avoid using the sink or shower. Lightning can travel through water pipes."	3
"Sri Lanka is located in the Indian Ocean. Scientists discovered more than 100 species, or kinds, of frogs living on the island. The new species of frogs vary quite a bit. ""[The frogs] range in size from about an inch to 4 inches and come in all colors,"" said one scientist. Some of the frogs live in trees. Others live on the leaf-covered ground. The frog discovery is good news. It leads scientists to believe there may be more frog species in other places around the world."	3
"""Hee, hee, hee. Ha, ha, ha."" People have all different kinds of laughs. No matter how you laugh, the result is the same. Laughing makes people feel good. A new study finds that simply looking forward to a laugh is good for you. Knowing you have a funny event planned reduces stress, scientists say. They also add that looking forward to a laugh helps your body fight disease. The next time you are not feeling your best, plan to do something that will make you laugh. Laughter just may be the best medicine after all."	3
"Looking into the shallow water, we spotted a baby manatee. To our surprise, the young manatee was alone. ""I've never seen one this small on its own!"" said Sullivan. We wondered, Where is the baby's mother? That is exactly the kind of question we hoped to answer. Along with other volunteers, I was helping scientists study manatees off the coast of Belize (beh-LEEZ). Belize is a country in Central America. We observed manatees and their habitat, an area where an animal lives. We were trying to find out how manatees spend their time. Manatees are large marine mammals with wrinkled, grayish brown skin. They can grow to 13 feet long and weigh up to 3,000 pounds. Scientists think that many manatees are living in the warm waters off the coast of Belize. Manatees have been protected by Belize law for about 70 years. Sullivan's team is trying to find better ways of protecting manatees. I hope that with help from volunteers like me, Sullivan will be able to help these gentle giants survive."	3
"A new kind of pet is becoming popular-the mini cow. ""They're almost like a dog, but they don't jump on you,"" said Dustin Pillard. He raises miniature cows on his farm in Iowa. Normal-sized cows can be 6 feet tall and weigh about 1,500 pounds. Mini cows are only about 3 feet tall and weigh a lot less than normal-sized cows. You would not be able to carry a mini cow in your arms though. ""They weigh about 500 pounds, so they aren't lap animals,"" said cattle rancher Robert Kehoe."	3
NASA wants to build an even better telescope than Hubble! It will be called the James Webb Space Telescope. James Webb was one of the people in charge of NASA. In 2010, NASA is planning on sending the new telescope into space. A rocket will launch the telescope. It will take the rocket about three months to complete its journey. The new telescope will be much farther from Earth than Hubble. Webb will take photos from 940,000 miles above Earth. That is about 700,000 miles farther than the moon! Scientists will use the new telescope to learn even more about the universe.	3
"Do you spend a lot of time watching television or surfing the Internet? While you may be having fun, you may also be missing out on something else-staying fit! The American Heart Association (AHA) recently reported that many U.S. kids are not getting enough exercise. The AHA recommends kids get at least 30 minutes of exercise three to four times each week. The AHA report says that about 15 out of every 100 kids ages 6 to 11 are overweight. Being overweight can lead to health problems like heart disease and diabetes later in life. To help kids stay fit and have fun, some schools are adding a new twist to gym class. In some elementary schools, students are really climbing the walls-indoor rock-climbing walls! Other schools are offering activities such as dancing, in-line skating, and kite flying. Teachers want kids to develop good fitness habits that will last a lifetime. ""We're hoping that students find activities that they enjoy doing and that they'll continue doing for the rest of their lives,"" said gym teacher Reid Chase. Many schools are teaching kids the importance of exercise both inside and out of school. So, what are you waiting for? Dance. Run. Jump rope. Join a sports team. Find the activities that you enjoy most and get moving!"	3
The Hubble Space Telescope takes photos from 380 miles above Earth. Hubble is huge. It is almost the size of a large school bus! Earlier this year, astronauts went to space to attach a new camera to Hubble. The new camera has helped scientists make many discoveries. Recently, Hubble took a photo of the Cone Nebula. A nebula is a cloud of gas and dust in space. Nearby hot stars cause the Cone Nebula to glow red.	3
"Did you know April is National Poetry Month? To celebrate, Weekly Reader interviewed a 12-year-old poet. His name is Mattie Stepanek. Mattie's latest book of poems, Loving Through Heartsongs, was published in January. Mattie has a rare form of muscular dystrophy. That is a disease that weakens muscles. Mattie needs a wheelchair to get around. He also uses a machine called a ventilator to help him breathe. However, Mattie does not let his disease get him down. He writes about ""seeing the hopeful side of things."" Love and peace are common themes in his poems. Mattie has advice for kids who want to write poetry. ""Just think about something you care about and listen to your heart,"" he said. ""Just say your feelings in your own words."""	3
"The monarchs' home in Mexico is slowly being destroyed. By law, trees cannot be cut down in certain areas of forest where the butterflies spend the winter. However, some people are cutting down the trees illegally. The trees are very important to the survival of monarchs. ""The forest is like an umbrella,"" said butterfly expert Lincoln Brower. ""If you chop holes in the umbrella, you cause trouble. The butterflies get cold and wet and freeze to death."" Mexican government officials are working with scientists to stop illegal logging. They are trying to preserve, or save the forest. Monarch butterflies migrate, or move from one area to another. Each fall, monarchs in North America head south for the winter. Most travel to the mountains of central Mexico. Some travel to Florida, California, and Texas. In the spring, the butterflies migrate north."	3
"On January 8, rescue workers tried to help save pilot whales in trouble. Pilot whales are actually members of the dolphin family. The whales were stranded on a beach off the coast of New Zealand. New Zealand is an island in the Pacific Ocean. It is not uncommon for a large pod, or group, of pilot whales to get stranded. They are highly social animals that stay close together. ""The value of sticking close together at times brings the risk of beaching. When one whale beaches, the other whales may follow,"" said scientist Michael Moore. Sadly, 120 whales died on the beach. But volunteers were able to rescue 39 of the whales. The rescuers poured cool water on the whales to protect them from the heat. They helped push the huge mammals back into the water. Then small boats led the pilot whales back to sea."	3
Do you ever wonder what cars will be like in the future? You can bet that they will be much different from the cars of today. They will also be better for the Earth. President Bush is excited about cars of the future. In a recent speech, he told Americans he wants our country to lead the world in building cars that do not pollute the environment. Auto companies are currently designing cars that will not run on gasoline. They will use other fuel sources that do not pollute the environment. Those cars may be on the road by the time you are old enough to drive.	3
"Zooming down a hill, you feel the wind rushing in your face. Seconds later, you are hanging upside down! You are riding a roller coaster. But are you safe? New roller coasters are getting bigger, faster, and scarier. Millions of kids and adults take these thrill rides each year. Some experts worry that the rides' sudden twists and turns are unsafe. High-speed coasters whip riders' heads back and forth. One report blamed coasters for 13 brain injuries from 1995 to 2000. Another report says some people have nearly died from coaster-related brain injuries. Recently, two scientists set out to learn if coasters really do cause brain injuries. They studied the effects of riding three of the fastest coasters in the United States. The scientists say the coasters' twists and turns are not fast enough to cause brain injuries. ""People take more than 1 billion rides on roller coasters each year. The reports on brain injury are few and not proven,"" said Douglas Smith. He is one of the scientists who did the new study. Some experts do not think the new study proves coasters are safe-especially for kids. They say the scientists only studied how coasters affect adults, not kids. They want a new study. Edward Markey is a government official. Recently, he asked a group of experts to include children in their next study about roller coaster safety. Results from that study will be reported next year. Roller coasters have to be studied to make sure that ""riders of all ages"" are safe, Markey said. • The idea for the roller coaster began with the ice slide. It was invented in Russia more than 500 years ago. • The fastest roller coaster in the world is in Japan. It speeds down a track at more than 100 miles per hour."	3
Hidden deep inside the Great Pyramid is a room with a mysterious door. Scientists recently used a robot to break through the door. The Great Pyramid towers over the desert in Egypt. The 480-foot pyramid was built about 4,500 years ago. It is the largest pyramid in Egypt. Egypt is a country in Africa. The pyramids were built as burial places for the pharaohs. Pharaohs were kings of ancient Egypt. The Great Pyramid was the burial place for the pharaoh Khufu. The Great Pyramid is made of more than 2 million blocks of stone. Each stone weighs an average of nearly 3 tons. Some experts say it took 100,000 people 20 years to build the Great Pyramid. Many pharaohs were buried with treasures. To keep thieves out, builders designed the pyramids with hidden rooms. No one knows what happened to Khufu's body or if he was buried with treasures. Perhaps the answer is behind a mysterious door inside the Great Pyramid. The passage that leads to the door is too small for a person to fit through. On September 16, scientists sent a small robot into the narrow passage. From inside the pyramid, scientists controlled the robot's movements. The robot drilled a hole through the thick stone door. The robot's camera showed a room on the other side of the door. The room looked empty, except for another door. The scientists were disappointed they did not find something in the room. Now they want to know what is hidden behind the second door. Some experts say something amazing may be behind the door. Others say there is nothing. Scientists hope to return to solve the mystery. Until then, people will have to wonder what is hidden behind door number two.	3
Venice is a famous city in Italy. It is built on small islands. To get around the city, people travel by boat. Over the years, Venice has been sinking slowly into the sea. Water levels are rising and causing flooding. The city needs help to stay above water. The government of Italy has a plan to save the city from floods. Government officials want to build a system of gates. The gates would block the seawater from flooding the city. The gates would take about ten years to complete. If the plan is a success, Venice will be saved from being swallowed by the sea.	3
"Scientists have found a huge ball of ice and rock flying through space. The newly discovered object may prove that Pluto is not a planet. How many planets are in our solar system? If you said nine, you might not be right. A new discovery might prove that Pluto is not a planet after all. Scientists discovered an object at the edge of our solar system. It is the biggest object found in the solar system since Pluto was discovered in 1930. The object was first spotted by a telescope from Earth. Scientists used the Hubble Space Telescope to take a closer look at it. Hubble is a telescope that was launched into space in 1990. Scientists nicknamed the icy object Quaoar (KWAH-o-ar). It is 4 billion miles from the sun. Quaoar is an asteroid. An asteroid is a space rock that is much smaller than a planet. Scientists say asteroids may be parts of a planet that never formed. Planets are large objects that go around, or orbit, the sun. Pluto is the farthest planet from the sun. However, Pluto is different from the other eight planets in our solar system. Pluto is the smallest and coldest planet. It is even smaller than Earth's moon. Pluto is the only planet made of frozen gases, just as the newly discovered asteroid is. Some scientists say thousands of asteroids may orbit the sun at the edge of the solar system. They add that Pluto and Quaoar are among two of those asteroids. ""Quaoar definitely hurts the case for [Pluto's] being a planet,"" said scientist Mike Brown. For now, the number of planets is a puzzle. Do you think Pluto should be called a planet? Why or why not?"	3
Is your backpack weighing you down? If the answer is yes, you are not the only one. Millions of kids load their backpacks full of heavy books and other supplies. American kids carry an average of 20 pounds on their backs! Studies show that wearing a heavy backpack can cause back and shoulder injuries later in life. Experts say that kids get more injuries when they wear their backpacks over one shoulder. Wearing both shoulder straps evens out the weight. Companies are now making backpacks that are better for the back. Some backpacks have wheels so you can pull them. Others have padded neck and back supports. No matter which type you choose, be smart and wear your backpack correctly. Your back will thank you!	3
"Which invention could you not live without? That was a question Americans were recently asked in a survey. The survey gave five choices: the computer, car, cell phone, microwave, and toothbrush. Believe it or not, the toothbrush came in first! The toothbrush is both the simplest and oldest invention on the list. According to the American Dental Association, the first toothbrush was invented in 1498. A Chinese emperor made it out of hog bristles and bone. ""The results show that [simple] inventions are important to people,"" said Kristin Joyce, a survey spokesperson. Won't dentists be pleased!"	3
"A polar bear sits at the edge of a frozen lake. Suddenly, the bear jumps forward and grabs a seal. By eating the seal, the polar bear might also be eating poison. The polar bear lives in the Arctic, the region around the North Pole. While the Arctic may seem far away, it is linked to the rest of the world. MPollutants from other parts of the world are ending up in the Arctic, says a new report. Pollutants are harmful chemicals or wastes that get into the air, land, or water. Most of the pollutants come from factories. Other pollutants are chemicals used to kill insects, weeds, and other pests. ""Most of these chemicals come from outside the Arctic,"" said Arctic expert Samantha Smith. Wind and water carry the chemicals to the Arctic. Plants and animals are linked together by the food chain. For example, a fish eats a tiny shrimplike animal. A seal eats the fish. A polar bear eats the seal. The pollutants stick to plants that grow in the water. Tiny animals in the water eat the plants. Fish eat both the plants and tiny animals. The fish also eat poisons from those plants and animals. Animals such as polar bears, seals, foxes, killer whales, and birds eat the poisoned fish. That is why so many animals are now in poor health. Some of them have trouble fighting diseases, scientists say. ""If these chemicals continue to build up in Arctic animals, it will be difficult for them to have babies. Eventually, only old animals will be left, and there will be no more to replace them after they die,"" said scientist Theo Colborn."	3
"Thousands of years ago, giant creatures roamed a frozen land. Scientists recently unearthed, or dug up, fossils of some of those creatures. While working at a gravel pit in England, Ray Davies made an amazing discovery. He found the huge skull of a woolly rhino in the bucket of his digging machine. Woolly rhinos were large animals that became extinct, or died out, long ago. After hearing about the discovery, scientists went to the gravel pit to get the skull. They looked in the pit for other fossils. Fossils are ancient remains of animals and plants. Scientists found many of the rhino's other bones. ""This is the best example of a woolly rhino I have ever seen,"" said scientist Andy Currant. Scientists later found the bones of three other woolly rhinos. In addition, scientists found the bones of a woolly mammoth, bison, reindeer, wild horse, and wolf. Scientists also found the remains of insects and plants. The fossils date back to a period of time called the Ice Age. That period started almost 2 million years ago. It ended around 10,000 years ago. During the Ice Age, snow and ice covered much of Earth. At the end of the Ice Age, some animals survived. Other animals, like the woolly rhino, became extinct. The new fossils are clues to the past. They will help scientists learn more about the Ice Age."	3
Do you ever wonder what it would be like to fly? Since 1992, the Young Eagles program has been giving kids free airplane rides in the sky. The program has the goal of giving a million kids a ride before December 17, 2003. That is the 100-year anniversary of the Wright brothers' first flight. The Wright brothers made history one day in December 1903. On that day, their dream of flying came true. They flew the first engine-powered airplane. Today, the Young Eagles program lets kids experience that same thrill of flight.	3
"Imagine that you had to play video games for homework. Does that sound too good to be true? At Prairie View Elementary in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, that is exactly what is happening. Prairie View is not alone. More than 4,000 schools across the country are assigning video-game homework! These are not ordinary video games, however. They are special educational games made for schools. At Prairie View, students borrow the games to take home. The school lends video-game systems to any student who does not already own one. The games teach students reading, language arts, and math skills. ""[The video games] are about having fun and learning,"" said third grader Hannah Stevens. ""I'm learning to do more math than I used to and more language arts."" Laurene Lanich, the principal at Prairie View, says students enjoy playing the video games. ""It's high interest for kids. It's very similar to typical children's video games. They can get to different levels,"" she said. Video-game homework also helps the home-school connection, says Lanich. ""It's an opportunity for children and parents to do something together that focuses on learning."""	3
"The world's largest volcano appears to be coming back to life. Scientists are keeping a close watch on it. If the volcano erupts, it could destroy nearby towns. A giant volcano on the island of Hawaii is beginning to show signs of life, scientists say. The volcano is called Mauna Loa. Mauna Loa is Hawaiian for ""Long Mountain."" It is the largest volcano on Earth. The volcano makes up half of the island of Hawaii. Hawaii is one of the islands that make up the state of Hawaii. Recently, scientists have noticed changes in Mauna Loa. The top of the volcano is growing slightly. Magma is rising into the giant volcano. Magma is hot, liquid rock beneath Earth's surface. The last time Mauna Loa erupted was in 1984. A river of lava flowed from the volcano for three weeks. Lava is magma flowing out of a volcano. The lava can reach temperatures of nearly 2,100 degrees Fahrenheit. Lava can burn everything in its path. Since 1984, many more people have moved to areas around Mauna Loa. They have built homes on the volcano's slopes. If the volcano erupts now, hot lava could destroy those homes. For now, people should not worry too much about an eruption, experts say. ""We're at a stage where it's months to years, rather than days to weeks"" before the next eruption, said scientist Peter Cervelli. Until then, scientists will continue to keep track of changes in the volcano. They hope to give people lots of warning about future eruptions. Mauna Loa is a shield volcano. Shield volcanoes form from lava flows. When lava cools, it hardens. The lava builds up and forms a low mountain."	3
What would you get if you crossed a dinosaur, a bird, and Bugs Bunny? You might get a bucktoothed dinosaur. Scientists recently found the remains of such a dinosaur in China. The dino has birdlike wings and two large buckteeth! Scientists say the bucktoothed dinosaur's teeth were not sharp. That is why they think the creature was most likely a plant eater. The dinosaur is related to the T. Rex. Until now, scientists thought all dinosaurs related to T. Rex were meat eaters!	3
Windmills have been used as a source of energy for hundreds of years. Today, modern windmills called wind turbines are grouped in wind farms. One of the world's largest wind farms spreads across the Oregon-Washington border. It supplies electricity to more than 70,000 homes and businesses.	3
"Third grader David Bates won the Weekly Reader American Values Contest. Nearly 14,000 students in grades 3 through 6 entered the contest. To enter, kids had to write an essay on which American value is most important in daily life. David chose to write about selfless service. He wrote, ""It is most important in my everyday life because it incorporates all the other values."" The prize for the contest was a trip to Washington, D.C. David attended the Veterans Day ceremonies on November 11. The next day, David toured the Pentagon and was made honorary mayor for the day."	3
"The toy stuck in John's throat. He began choking. Luckily, Lauren knew what to do. She had read about the Heimlich (HIGHM-lik) maneuver in Weekly Reader. The Heimlich maneuver is a special lifesaving hug. It can help save the life of a person who is choking. ""All of a sudden [the Weekly Reader story] popped in my head,"" Lauren said. ""I ran behind [John] and put my hand in front of his stomach."" Lauren then pushed in and up, and the toy popped out of John's mouth."	3
When you read action verbs such as hop and clap, your brain gets moving! That's what a recent study found. Scientists say the part of your brain that tells muscles to perform those actions also becomes active when you read those words. The area of the brain that controls actions such as waving your hand or kicking a ball is called the motor cortex. It runs along the surface of your brain from ear to ear. Scientists once thought the brain had a separate area for language. The new study suggests that the brain is a lot more complicated. When your brain reads action words, it really is on the go!	3
Which famous African American do you most admire? Weekly Reader asked some third graders at Tamarac Elementary School in Holtsville, New York, that question. Here's what they said: Rosa Parks was a very brave woman. She refused to give up her seat on a bus to a white person. She helped change the laws in our country by standing up for what she believed in. Hockey player Anson Carter is whom I admire. He has proved to be a decent power forward for the New York Rangers. He always gives 100 percent. That will help the Rangers make their drive for the playoffs.	3
"However, don't rush out to try to get a peek at the planet. It is too far away to be seen. Scientists found the planet by using the Hubble Space Telescope. That is a telescope located in space. It takes photos from about 375 miles above Earth. Scientists say the new discovery is important. It suggests that planets began forming much earlier than experts once thought. ""This means that 13 billion years ago, life could have arisen and then died out,"" said one scientist."	3
"You were fine a moment ago. Now you're tired and achy. The school nurse takes your temperature. You have a fever. Bad news-those are all symptoms of the flu, or influenza(in- floo-EN-zah). Hang in there; you are not alone. This flu season started early, and the virus spread quickly. The good news is that flu season appears to have slowed down. Some health experts say this flu season was most harmful to kids. Doctors' offices and hospitals have been flooded with sick kids. Schools in several states have closed for ""sick days"" because so many kids had the flu. To keep the virus from spreading, many teachers have asked students to wash their hands often. School officials want to make sure healthy students don't get sick."	3
What do you like with your burger? How about ketchup, pickles, and blueberries? Yes, that's right. Scientists are adding blueberry powder and puree (PYOO-ray) to burgers. Puree is made when fruit is mashed. Mixing berries and meat may seem odd. Scientists, however, have good reasons for the weird mix. Blueberries make the burgers juicier and more healthful. The berries help prevent diseases, such as cancer. Berry burgers may end up on your plate in the near future. Scientists hope that they will one day be a part of school lunches. But don't expect the burgers to be blue.	3
"Before freeing the butterflies, Evan had a job to do. He placed a tiny numbered sticker on each monarch. Those black-and-orange butterflies were among thousands that kids across the country tagged. Volunteers in Mexico look for the monarchs wearing tags. The tags help scientists figure out which butterflies reached Mexico and how far they flew. Scientists fear that monarchs may become endangered, or at risk of dying out. People are cutting down trees in Mexico where the butterflies spend the winter. ""Our goal is to save the monarch migration,"" said butterfly expert Chip Taylor. ""To do this, we have to learn as much as we can about how the number of monarchs changes from year to year."" Kids like Evan are helping scientists do just that!"	3
"This summer's movie Finding Nemo was a big hit. The movie follows the adventures of Nemo, a young clownfish. Now many kids want their own Nemo. Since the movie opened, sales of clownfish have doubled at some pet stores. This is not the first time a movie has sent people running to pet stores. After Disney's movie 101 Dalmatians, people rushed to buy the spotted dogs. A few months later, many of the dogs ended up in rescue shelters. Their owners did not want to take care of them anymore. Taking care of a clownfish is not an easy task. The fish needs daily care and attention. ""Owning a pet fish is a major responsibility,"" said a Disney spokesperson. Some animal rights groups worry about the latest pet craze. They want people to remember an important message from Finding Nemo -- respect animals."	3
"Most wild cheetahs live in Africa. Animal experts are worried that cheetahs are in danger of disappearing from parts of Africa. One wildlife group in South Africa is trying to protect these big cats. The group is working to find out how many cheetahs are left in South Africa and where they roam. To track the animals, they use radio collars, cameras, and aircraft. Experts will use what they learn to find ways to save cheetahs. The biggest threat to cheetahs comes from people. They have built farms on land where the animals live. As farming areas spread, cheetahs often have trouble finding food. In addition, farmers who want to protect their animals sometimes kill cheetahs. The good news is that there still is hope for cheetahs. The group is helping to move cheetahs away from the farms to other areas in the wild. ""Cheetahs are very, very special,"" said the group's director. ""It would be a great shame if a time came when our children and our children's children were not able to see the cheetah."""	3
"To make the tape, scientists studied gecko lizards. The little lizards are great climbers. They can cling to smooth walls and hang from glass ceilings. What is the secret to the gecko's power? A gecko has millions of tiny hairs on the bottom of its feet. The hairs create a natural force between the gecko's feet and the wall. Scientists modeled the new tape after the feet of geckos. The tape is covered with billions of tiny plastic hairs. ""It's like Velcro,"" said one scientist. It will be a long time before the sticky tape is ready for people to use. One scientist believes it may be ready in five years. Until then, the little lizards are still the climbing champions!"	3
"What would you do with 10 million dollars? Would you buy a map? That is what officials at the Library of Congress, the nation's library, did. However, they didn't buy an ordinary map. This map is special. It is the first one to name ""America."" The map was one of 1,000 copies made in 1507. It is the only known copy to survive. For hundreds of years, the map was kept in a castle in Germany. Germany is a country in Europe. It took Congress years to raise enough money to buy the map. The Library of Congress has the world's largest map collection-almost 5 million! One library official has called the new map the ""crown jewel"" of its collection."	3
"Imagine finding out that your backyard is rich in Native American history. That is exactly what Lynn Ripley of Virginia learned. For years, she had been finding old items in her yard. Those items included arrowheads and pieces of pottery. This spring, scientists learned about her collection. They were in awe. The items are artifacts from the 1600s! Artifacts are objects made by people long ago. Based on their research, scientists believe they have found the site of the village where Pocahontas grew up. Pocahontas was the daughter of a powerful Native American chief. ""Itâ€™s a place that may help us to add the native side of early Colonial history,"" said one expert."	3
"Ten-year-old Hunter York found a most unusual creature in his father's backyard. It was a snake with two heads! It ""kind of freaked me out a bit,"" said Hunter. Hunter ran into the house to tell his father about the 8-inch reptile. Reptiles are cold-blooded animals. Not all reptiles crawl on their bellies the way snakes do. Turtles and lizards are reptiles that creep on short legs. Hunter's dad gave the two-headed reptile to a snake expert because they could not get it to eat. ""We couldn't force-feed it because we don't know which head eats,"" said his dad."	3
What are red, white, and blue and roll around town? The ABC News election buses! They hit the road this month. The buses are TV studios on wheels. They will travel across the country following the presidential campaign. To teach kids about the election process, ABC News teamed up with Weekly Reader. The buses will also visit schools during the campaign.	3
For two nights, a group of kids who took part in the study went to bed at their usual bedtime. Afterward, they were given tests for memory and attention span. Both of those things are important for learning in school. On the third night, some kids went to bed one hour earlier than usual. Others went to bed one hour later. The next day, experts tested the kids again. Here is what the experts found: The kids who slept an extra hour improved their test scores. Some kids did better by as much as two grade levels! The kids who lost an hour of sleep did not improve their scores. Most third graders need at least nine hours of sleep each night, say experts. However, studies show that many kids are not sleeping enough. That can make it hard for kids to pay attention in school. Going to bed early is not easy, experts agree. But itâ€™s worth it! One extra hour of sleep may mean the difference between doing well and falling asleep in class.	3
It takes hard work, skill, and bravery. Weekly Reader spoke with Captain Brian Webster. For 27 years, he has been a firefighter in California. Here is what he told us: Webster: Yes! The Santa Ana winds blow hot, dry air from the desert at that time of year. They are very strong. Firefighters can't prevent the fires from burning until the winds stop. Webster: The excitement and adventure. I get to help people and save lives and property. That gives me a good feeling. Webster: There is danger. It can also be sad. Sometimes, people lose their homes. Some people die. The long hours, not having enough sleep, and being away from my family are also difficult. Webster: Most of the time, we are a big team. We had more than 4,000 firefighters battling a wildfire in San Bernardino. Webster: That comes with experience. The longer you are a firefighter, the more control you have over your emotions. But even for the old-timers, this fire was a scary one. Would you want to be a firefighter? Why or why not?	3
"A real-life Buzz Light year recently set a world record. His name is Felix Baumgartner, but people call him ""Fearless Felix."" He was the first person to fly across the English Channel without power. The English Channel is a body of water. It separates England and France, two countries in Europe. In July, Felix jumped from a plane flying over England. He wore a wing on his back to glide over the water. When Felix was in the air, he had trouble seeing through the clouds. To find his way, Felix followed two planes that led him across the English Channel. After he made it to the other side, Felix opened up his parachute. He floated to the ground and landed in France. His flight took about 14 minutes. Felix described it as ""amazing."" ""It was total freedom, he said. ""I felt like a bird."""	3
"Two scoops of coffee ice cream. A cold glass of soda pop. A handful of chocolate. Is your mouth watering? If you are like most kids, you can't get enough of those sweet treats. However, those foods contain something that might surprise you--caffeine (KA-feen)! Caffeine is a chemical found in the fruits, seeds, and leaves of some plants. A recent study found that kids may have too much caffeine in their diets. Loading up on caffeine can make you sick. You may feel shaky or get an upset stomach. Too much caffeine before bed can keep you up at night. If you are tired, you may have trouble learning in school the next day. Many kids have a lot of caffeine without knowing it. That's because few foods and drinks show caffeine amounts on their labels. There are some easy ways to cut back on caffeine. Drink less soda pop or look for labels that say caffeine-free. You can also have fewer foods and drinks that are flavored with coffee and chocolate. If you have less caffeine in your diet, experts say you will feel better. ""There's no reason for kids to [have] all that caffeine,"" said one expert. Most experts say kids should not have more than 100 milligrams (mg) of caffeine each day. How much caffeine do some foods and drinks contain? Take a look at the chart to the right to find out."	3
"About 39 million Americans are Hispanic. They are also known as Latinos. Hispanic Americans now make up the largest minority group in the country. Hispanic Americans are people living in the United States whose families came from Spanish-speaking countries. Most of those countries are located in Central America and South America. Many Hispanics are also from Mexico, Puerto Rico, Cuba, and Spain. Officials predict that the number of Hispanics in the United States will keep growing. ""[That marks] a turning point in the nation's history,"" said one official. Many Americans will soon celebrate Hispanic Heritage Month. It takes place from September 15 through October 15. During that time, many students will learn about Hispanic customs and history. How do you celebrate your heritage? Why should you learn about other people's heritages?"	3
"Until a few months ago, Karli Mosher from Massachusetts had very long hair. It hung down past her waist. Not anymore! The 9-year-old recently chopped it off for a good cause. Karli donated her hair to Locks of Love. That is a group that provides wigs to kids who have lost their hair because of certain medical conditions. After watching a TV program about Locks of Love, Karli remembered a classmate who had lost her hair. ""I felt sad for her,"" Karli told Weekly Reader. It was then that Karli decided to donate her own hair. Now she plans to grow her hair long again. ""In the future, when my hair gets really long, I'm going to do it again, and again!"" exclaimed Karli."	3
"Wiffle ball has become a favorite backyard game through the years. This year, the famous plastic ball turns 50! The Wiffle ball was invented in 1953. A few years later, the yellow plastic bat became part of the game. A Connecticut man got the idea for the Wiffle ball after watching his son play ball with a friend. ""He decided he wanted to make a ball that would make it easier for us to pitch,"" said his son. The Wiffle ball is hollow and has eight holes on one side. In the air, the ball dips and curves. That makes it hard for a batter to hit. How did the ball get its name? When a kid swung at a ball and missed, kids used to say he or she had whiffed, said the inventor's grandson."	3
More and more kids are using their heads. A recent study found that 73 out of every 100 kids wore a helmet while riding a bike. The bad news is that most of the kids did not wear the helmet the right way. A helmet protects your head and brain if you fall. To work, the helmet must fit and be worn correctly. The helmet should rest on your head and cover your forehead. Helmet straps should always be tight. If the helmet is too loose, it wonâ€™t protect your head. In-line skaters and skateboard riders should listen up too! Helmets are not just for biking. Experts say that kids should wear helmets for other wheel sports as well. Be smart and put safety first!	3
"In 1996, China loaned her parents to the United States. The two nations agreed that any cubs born in the United States would be sent to China. A few months ago, Hua Mei arrived in China by airplane. Now she lives in a protected nature center with other pandas. ""She seems quite happy to be in the land of her ancestors,"" said one spokesperson. Giant pandas are an endangered species. They live in the forests of southwestern China. Experts estimate that fewer than 1,000 giant pandas live in the wild."	3
"The Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King addresses a group of followers. As a child growing up in the South, King saw that African Americans were treated unfairly. He wanted all Americans to have equal rights. However, at that time, the laws did not give African Americans the same rights as those of white people. When King was older, he worked to change the laws. To do that, he led peaceful marches and gave powerful speeches. In 1963, he gave his famous ""I Have a Dream"" speech in Washington, D.C. King's dream was to make the world a better place. With the help of King's work, civil rights laws were passed. Those laws protect the rights of all U.S. citizens. In what ways do you keep King's dream alive today?"	3
Scientists are now debating the future of this telescope. NASA had planned to take Hubble down in 2010. A new telescope is scheduled for launch in 2011. However, some scientists say its photos will not be as clear as Hubble's. They say Hubble should stay in space longer. The problem is that Hubble's parts wear out over time. Every few years, astronauts visit Hubble to make repairs. NASA officials say that to keep Hubble working past 2010 would be costly-about 600 million dollars! Many people say that is too much money to spend. What do you think?	3
"Nine-year-old Aubrie LeClair of Connecticut is often busy at her computer. Like a lot of kids today, she uses the computer to type her schoolwork and learn new things. By third grade, many kids know how to type on a keyboard. That has some handwriting experts worried. They are afraid that computers will replace cursive writing in the future. ""[The kids have] good handwriting now, and they love cursive,"" said one teacher from California. ""But it wouldn't surprise me if they just walked around with their little keyboards and typed everything a few years from now."" Third grade is the year when most kids learn how to write in cursive. However, many kids like Aubrie say they would rather type than write in cursive. ""Computers are better. [They don't] make my hand cramp up as much,"" said Aubrie. No one knows what will become of cursive writing. In the meantime, keep practicing. For the time being, it seems that cursive is sticking around."	3
"Sonia Mia never actually left the ground. The ride gives people the feeling of blasting off into space. ""Going on the ride made me think about how brave astronauts are,"" said Sonia Mia. No astronauts have gone to Mars yet. Mission: SPACE lets people see what a visit to Mars might be like in the future. To read more about Sonia Mia's adventure, visitwww.weeklyreader.com/kids/grade3."	3

"The president told the kids, ""I'm excited to be here."" The kids were excited, too. Some kids even got to shake hands with the president. President Bush was at the school to thank the principal and teachers. They helped many students become better readers. ""We believe every child can learn,"" said the president."	3
"Ten-year-old Michael Zollars recently went on the ride of his life. He and a pilot flew through the sky in a small airplane. ""It was fun!"" Michael said. ""I got to take the controls for a while."" Michael was taking part in the Young Eagles program, which began in 1992. Pilots for the program have a goal of giving a million kids free rides in private airplanes by December 17, 2003. That date is special! It is the 100th anniversary of the first powered flight, made by the Wright brothers. Three days later, though, the brothers succeeded! That day, they made their mark on history. ""The airplane changed people's lives,"" Steve Buss, the director of the Young Eagles program, told Weekly Reader. In honor of the Wright brothers, the one millionth Young Eagles flight is scheduled for December 17. It will take place at a celebration at Kitty Hawk. ""The first 100 years [of flight] were exciting-from the Wright Flyer to landing on the moon,"" said Buss. ""Hopefully, through the Young Eagle's program, the kids of today will make the next 100 years even more exciting."""	3
The results are in! At the beginning of the school year, we asked kids: How much weight are you carrying in your backpack? More than 2,000 kids responded to our online poll. Carrying packs that are too heavy may cause injury. Doctors say most third graders' packs should weigh no more than 8 pounds. The good news is that most of you are following that advice. More than 1,300 kids replied that they carry 8 pounds or less. Still, some kids are very overloaded. Of the kids polled, 465 told us they lugged around more than 12 pounds! If that is true for you, it may be time to clean out your backpack and lighten up!	3
"On March 27, hundreds of colorful kites will fill the sky over the National Mall. That is a park in Washington, D.C., where a kite festival will be held. Nearly 25,000 people attend the popular event each year. This year's theme is ""Kites Around the World."" ""Kites are something people celebrate all over the world,"" event organizer Brandi Rose told Weekly Reader. ""The festival is a way to bring all of the cultures together in one place,"" she said. The culture of a group of people refers to their way of life, ideas, and traditions. Some people have built their own kites for the festival. ""I chose to build a Japanese fighter kite,"" said Mike Van Meers. ""In 17th-century Japan, the kites were built with bamboo and paper. I'm building one with modern materials."" Experts think kites were first made in China more than 2,000 years ago. Legend has it that a Chinese farmer invented the kite. On a very windy day, he tied a string to his hat. He held the string to keep his hat from blowing away. Traders from China spread kite flying to other parts of the world. ""Kites come in all different shapes and sizes,"" said Van Meers. ""Every culture is unique, and every culture has a different style."" The kite gets its name from a bird of the same name. Kites are graceful, soaring birds with long, narrow wings. These birds were once common in England. In the 1600s, kids in England made toys that sailed through the sky when pulled with a string. When the toys moved, they looked like the gliding birds."	3
How about riding around town in a Hello Kitty cab? Itâ€™s possible if you live in Japan, a country in Asia. Ten Hello Kitty cabs recently hit the streets near Tokyo. That is the capital of Japan. The cabs are popular with Hello Kitty fans. The cartoon cat celebrates her 30th birthday next year. From cabs to jewelry, Hello Kitty has made her mark around the world.	3
The 2004 Summer Olympics are almost here! The Summer Games occur every four years. This year, they will take place August 13-29. Athletes from nearly 200 countries will compete in 28 sports. Swimming, tennis, basketball, and gymnastics are among those sports. This year, the Olympics are heading home to the place where they first began--Greece. That is a country in Europe. The first Olympic Games were held in Greece about 2,780 years ago. The modern Olympics began there in 1896. To kick off the Olympics, a special event called the Torch Relay takes place. The relay started in Greece on March 25 with the lighting of the Olympic flame. The flame is a symbol of competition, friendship, and peace. During the relay, thousands of runners carry the Olympic flame around the world. The flame is passed from torch to torch. It will travel around Greece for seven days. Runners will then take the flame around the world for 35 days. During that time, the flame will journey across six continents and 27 countries. On July 9, the flame will return to Greece. Runners will carry it around the country until August 13, when they will light the flame at the Olympic stadium.	3
"What's green, wears a crown, and is a symbol of freedom? The Statue of Liberty! Over the years, millions of people have visited this statue in New York City. However, it has been closed since the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. Visitors have not been allowed to climb the 354 steps to the crown. Experts say that it might be difficult for people to make their way down from the statue's crown in an emergency. The group that cares for Lady Liberty is raising money to make the statue safer so it can reopen. Officials have not said whether people will be allowed to climb above the pedestal, or base, of the statue again. For third grader Nina Wade that would be very sad news. She moved to New York City almost two years ago and has never climbed the statue's steps. ""I would be disappointed if it didn't reopen,"" Nina told Weekly Reader, ""but it makes me feel good to know that [officials are] taking safety measures."""	3
"Have you ever listened to the sounds that paper makes? To composer Tan Dun, paper is music. He invented instruments made of paper and wrote music to play on them. This October, a group of fifth graders were among the first to hear musicians perform Dun's piece. The big event was held at the newly opened Walt Disney Concert Hall in California. Dun wrote the musical piece to celebrate the art of making paper. About 2,000 years ago, the world's first fine paper was invented in China. China is the country in Asia where Dun was born. ""Using your imagination, you can find music around you, even in paper! Music is everywhere if you just look for it,"" Dun told Weekly Reader. During the concert, musicians made sounds with the instruments in different ways. They tore, shook, hit, and even sang through the paper. Bet you didn't know paper could be so musical!"	3
"Fossil expert Neville Hollingworth recently made a huge discovery in England. He spotted a bone sticking out of the ground. The bone turned out to be the skull of a woolly mammoth! That was a period of time that started almost 2 million years ago and ended about 11,000 years ago. During the Ice Age, snow and ice covered much of Earth. The 220-pound woolly mammoth skull was not easy to unearth. ""It is such a spectacular, huge thing,"" said Hollingworth. ""It took seven hours to carefully dig out and needed four of us to carry it."" Scientists were very excited about the find. This was only the second time a woolly mammoth skull has been discovered in England. By studying the skull, scientists hope to learn more about these Ice Age creatures."	3
"Laura Bush spoke to the young reporter about the National Book Festival. It was held in early October in Washington, D.C. The festival honors authors and celebrates reading. Fabien learned that the first lady liked to read Weekly Reader when she was a child. ""If you love to read, you'll never be lonely-you'll always have a friend,"" she told him. ""[Reading] will also help you do well in school."""	3
Akiane (ah-KEE-ah-nah) Kramarik from Idaho may be just 9 years old, but she has an amazing talent for art. Some of her paintings have sold for $7,000 to $30,000 apiece. Weekly Reader (WR) spoke with Akiane. Here is what she told us: Akiane: Painting hands and feet-each fingernail and wrinkle. It's pretty hard. Akiane: I paint three to five hours a day and home-school. With home schooling, I have more time to paint and more time for poetry. Akiane: The colors! They're so beautiful. I love the colors on the paintings.	3
"Would you believe a nickel could be worth a million dollars? That's how much a coin dealer recently offered to pay for one. The coin is rare. It's a 1913 Liberty Head nickel. Only five of them were made at the U.S. Mint. The nickel had been missing for more than 40 years. The last owner of the nickel was a man from North Carolina. When he died in 1962, he left the rare coin to his family. However, they thought it was a fake and kept it in a closet. A few months ago, the coin dealer announced a million-dollar reward for the nickel. That's when the family took it to the dealer and learned it was the real thing! The family decided not to sell the nickel right away. If they do sell it, experts say the coin could go for more than 2 million dollars. ""It's like holding a winning lottery ticket,"" said the coin dealer."	3
"NASA* recently launched two rovers into space. Scientists chose the launch date carefully. In August, Mars and Earth were closer than at any time in the past 60,000 years. The rovers are on a mission. They are looking for signs that water once existed on Mars. Scientists say that water is the key to life. If they find evidence of water, that could mean there was once life on Mars. The rovers each have a parachute and an airbag to help them bounce to a safe landing. Once the rovers land, they will drill into rocks and take photos of them. Then, the rovers will send the photos back to Earth. Mars is more like Earth than any other planet in our solar system. Mars has mountains, valleys, and ice caps. It also has seasons. Scientists are hoping the rovers will provide clues to the Red Planet's past. The mission may also give scientists clues to Earth's future. ""We think Mars used to be more like Earth,"" said one scientist. ""Now look at it: It's harsh and cold. We know Earth is changing; this might help us understand how it has changed, and will [change] in the future."" The names of the rovers are Spirit and Opportunuty. They were named by 9 year old Sofi Collis of Arizona. She was the winner of a rover naming contest."	3
"For years, scientists have been debating that question. Now a new exhibit at the Natural History Museum in London, England, gives evidence for both sides. ""Everything says this dinosaur lived on dead meat,"" said American scientist Jack Horner. He helped the museum prepare for the exhibit. Scientists once believed that T. rex was a fast runner. But recent studies have shown that might not be true. Horner says that T. rex was not fast enough to catch other dinosaurs. He also says that its arms were too small to use for grabbing prey. Prey is an animal hunted by another animal for food. Name: Tyrannosaurus rex means ""tyrant lizard king."" Tyrant means ""cruel ruler."" Could T. rex have been both a hunter and a scavenger? One museum official thinks ""the truth lies somewhere in the middle."" It is up to visitors to think like scientists and decide for themselves. What do you think?"	3
"Brianna was one of 261 people recently sued by the music industry. Music officials said she had stolen about 1,000 songs because she copied and shared the songs without paying for them. The music industry wants people to know that it is against the law to copy and share songs over the Internet. Music officials say that is just like stealing CDs from a store. To avoid going to court, Brianna's mother paid the music industry $2,000. ""I am sorry for what I have done,"" said Brianna. ""I love music and don't want to hurt the artists I love."" Do you agree with what the music industry did? Why or why not?"	3
"When Saddam ruled Iraq, teachers were forced to mention him in every class, from history to music. In gym class, students had to chant, ""We all love Saddam!"" while they exercised. ""Children's minds have shrunk here. They have no imagination. They [were] taught only to memorize,"" said one teacher. Now students will have the chance to learn new ideas about the world. They will use new textbooks that do not include pictures of the former president of Iraq. Although students are eager to learn, not all schools are ready to teach. Many schools still need supplies and books. Americans are helping out. They have donated pencils, crayons, and other school supplies. U.S. soldiers are repainting and rebuilding schools. What do you value most about your school? Why? ""Saddam Hussein is the past. He's gone,"" said one school principal. ""Americans are our friends, and they helped us rebuild our school."""	3
Armed with your sharpest pencil, you are ready for a spelling test. The first word is bludge, then phat, then oy. You think, Wait a minute! Are those words for real? Believe it or not, they are! Those words are among the 10,000 new entries in the latest edition of Merriam-Webster's Collegiate (kuh-LEE-jit) Dictionary. How do new words make it into the dictionary? Editors spend a lot of time word hunting. They read, listen to the radio, and watch TV to find new words. How phat (excellent) is that? Each new word is entered into a computer. Once every ten years, the dictionary is updated from cover to cover. Don't bludge (goof off)! Go learn some new words!	3
The brush was discovered in Germany. Experts think it dates to about 1750. That could make it the oldest toothbrush found in Europe. The brush is so old that its bristles have rotted away. Its 4-inch handle is made of animal bone. One end of the handle was carved into a tiny spoon. Scientists believe the spoon was used to clean out the owner's ears. Many people may think a toothbrush that old is a great find, but dentists might disagree. They recommend getting a new one every three to four months.	3
The Liberty Bell no longer rings today. During the move, wireless technology will be attached to the bell. The area around the bell is being rebuilt and improved. Liberty Hall Pavilion is being torn down. The bell will be moved to its new home 200 yards away. It is called Liberty Bell Center. Although the new site is only a short distance away, the move will be a tricky one. The bell weighs 2,080 pounds. If it is not moved with care, the bell's famous crack could split even more. A team of experts has been working to protect the bell during its move. Before the move, three tiny sensors will be placed on the bell. The sensors will sound an alarm if there is any damage to the bell's crack. Special paper will be placed under the sensors so they will not scratch the bell. The Liberty Bell is a symbol of American freedom. The bell was rung to call people together for special events. It rang on July 8, 1776, to gather people for the first reading of the Declaration of Independence. That was signed on July 4, 1776. Experts are hopeful the bell's move will be a success. They want people to see the bell-and the crack that made it famous-for years to come. What are some other American symbols? Why are those symbols important?	3
When she was 8 years old, Misha liked to jump up and down on her nest. She played with her food. Sometimes she needed her motherâ€™s help to cross from one tree to another. Misha is one of thousands of orangutans that live in Asia. They are found on the islands of Borneo and Sumatra. Scientists are worried about the survival of these red-haired apes. They are in danger of becoming extinct, or dying out. Scientists say orangutans could be extinct in the wild within ten years. Why are orangutans in such danger? Their habitat is being destroyed. A habitat is the area where an animal makes its home. People are the main threat to these apes. Some people cut down trees in the areas where orangutans live. The trees are sold as lumber. In addition, people steal baby orangutans from the forest and sell them as pets. Do you think it is important to save orangutans? Why?	3
The study suggests that the effects last a long time. Kids who quit playing an instrument still had improved verbal memories a year later. Why might music help your verbal memory? Scientists say both tasks take place in the same area of the brain. One scientist said kids who have good verbal memories may find learning in school easier. She adds that good memory alone is not the only key to success. To do well in school, kids also need to work hard.	3
"The idea to honor popcorn came from a group of second and third graders. They called themselves the ""Kernel Kids."" The kids invited a state senator to their school to tell him about their idea. The senator thought it was good and told other officials about the idea. In August, the governor of Illinois signed the popcorn bill. At the ceremony, the guests ate popcorn. The students wore popcorn hats that they had made."	3
"How did all those cats and dogs get so pudgy? Their owners are feeding them too much food! What should you do if your cat or dog is too heavy? Give your pet less food, say animal experts. Pudgy pets can be given smaller meals or diet pet food. Regular exercise also keeps pets from becoming couch potatoes. Owners often share their food with their pets. ""Dogs and cats have their own special food for a reason. They donâ€™t digest human food well,"" said Volkerts. ""The best way to spoil pets is to play with them."""	3
"Scientists recently made an unusual discovery. They found a new species, or type, of frog. At first glance, the frog looks like a bright purple blob! However, if you look closer, you will see its tiny head and pointy snout. This strange-looking amphibian (am-FIB-ee-ahn) was found in India, a country in Asia. An amphibian is an animal that spends part of its life in water and the rest of its life on land. No other frog alive today is quite like it, say scientists. ""I'm absolutely amazed,"" said one frog expert. ""This is really fantastic; it's weird stuff."""	3
"Since then, people have found ways to honor the seven astronauts who died. Third graders in San Ramon, California, made a memorial quilt. It is made up of pictures of space. The names of the astronauts are sewn on the quilt. In June, the kids donated the quilt to officials at NASA. Officials will offer the quilt to families of the Columbia astronauts. Teacher Bob Dolin knows his class made a difference. ""To let the families know that some little class of 20 kids is thinking about them... [is] so great"	3
"Third graders at Shamrock Springs Elementary in Indiana recently helped protect a tropical rain forest. ""We wanted to save the trees because animals use them for homes,"" said 9-year-old Melinda Workman. The students sold T-shirts and raised more than $5,000 to protect 41 acres of rain forest. Imagine a warm, rainy place with beautiful flowers growing on tall trees. If you stand quietly, you might hear the sounds of birds chirping and monkeys swinging from branch to branch. That place is a tropical rain forest. It is home to more species, or kinds, of plants and animals than any other place in the world. Many foods we eat and medicines we use come from plants that grow there. Tropical rain forests are in trouble. Loggers cut down trees to burn for energy and sell as lumber. People also remove rain forest trees to make room for farms and roads. The money raised by the third-grade class will help buy privately owned rain forest land. The land will become part of a protected park. ""There are lots of things in the rain forest we need,"" said third-grade student Neil Koglin. ""We have to keep them there and use them wisely."" April 22 is Earth Day! It began in 1970 as a way to remind people to take care of our planet. On that day, millions of people around the world will help make Earth a better place. Some people will spend the day outside cleaning up litter. Others will plant trees. How will you celebrate Earth Day?"	3
Those ocean creatures may soon have no place to live. A recent study shows that many coral reefs around the world are being destroyed. Some scientists say more than half of the world's reefs may be gone by the year 2030. What is causing coral reefs to disappear? Scientists say people are largely to blame. Ships and fishing nets often damage the reefs. Other threats include pollution, storms, and disease. Coral reefs may look like rocks, but they are actually living structures. They are made up of tiny sea animals. Those tiny creatures are called coral polyps. The polyps build hard shells around themselves. When a polyp dies, it leaves behind its shell. Young polyps attach themselves to the old shells. Over many years, the polyps form a coral reef. Scientists are working hard to protect coral reefs. They are mapping and studying the reefs. Many protected areas are being widened. Fishing is not allowed in those areas.	3
"A habitat is a place in nature where an animal lives. The bears' habitat became smaller as people cut down trees to build homes and roads. Many people thought they would never again see a grizzly in the West. Now wildlife officials say the bears are making a comeback. Grizzly bears live in Yellowstone National Park and the surrounding forests. That area covers parts of the western states of Wyoming, Montana, and Idaho. Today, more than 550 grizzlies live there. That is almost double the number that lived there in the 1980s! The bears living in the Yellowstone area have been protected by the Endangered Species Act since 1975. Wildlife officials say those bears may be taken off the endangered species list within the next year. ""That does not mean the bears will no longer be protected,"" grizzly bear expert Chris Servheen told Weekly Reader. ""We will continue to monitor them to make sure they are healthy. A lot of people are interested in making sure grizzlies survive."" Is it important to set aside areas of land where people can't build roads and homes? Why or why not?"	3
The creature had small ears and eyes and a very long tail. Scientists found the animal's remains in Venezuela (ven-eh-ZWAY-lah). That is a country in South America. Why did those giant rodents become extinct? Their size might have caused them to die out. Scientists say such a huge animal would have had trouble outrunning and hiding from an attacking animal.	3
"His mother was eating a piece of chicken while walking around the kitchen. Suddenly, she began to choke on her food. She thought, ""What should I do?"" Luckily, Steven knew exactly what to do. He jumped up and rushed to his mother. Steven stood behind her and put his hands over her stomach. Then he pressed in and up, forcing out the piece of chicken. Steven performed what is called the Heimlich (HIGHM-lik) maneuver. That is a special move that can save the life of someone who is choking. How did Steven know what to do? He had read about the lifesaving move in Weekly Reader last year. ""Itâ€™s amazing that he learned it from reading a diagram,"" said Stevenâ€™s mother. ""That information really helped me out."" 1. Stand behind the choking person and wrap your arms around his or her waist. 2. Make a fist and hold it against the personâ€™s stomach, about halfway between the belly button and the rib cage. 3. Grab your fist with your other hand. Press it in with an upward thrust. Repeat until the person stops choking."	3
Scientists have been making silk for years. However, they have not been able to produce silk as strong as a spiderâ€™s silk. Now some scientists say they have figured out the secret to making strong silk. Scientist David Kaplan told Weekly Reader what his team learned. He said that a spiderâ€™s body has a little sac where it stores tiny blobs of silk in water. When the spider releases water, the blobs turn into a gel. The spider squeezes the gel from its body, and the silk hardens. Scientists are now using what they learned to make a strong silk. They believe the silk will help people in many ways. It may be used for making clothes that protect police officers and soldiers. Scientists say the silk may also be used to repair bones and ligaments in peopleâ€™s bodies. A ligament is strong tissue that holds bones in place. Besides silk, what other things in nature are useful to people? How are they useful?	3
"Nine-year-old Dakota Fanning found out. She plays Sally in the movie Dr. Seussâ€™ The Cat in the Hat. It opens in theaters this month. The movie is based on the book The Cat in the Hat by Dr. Seuss. The book was first published in 1957. More than 40 years later, it is still a best-seller. The movie brings the characters from the book to life--and even adds a few new ones. ""We all had just a fabulous time [making the movie],"" Dakota told Weekly Reader. What was her favorite part about playing Sally? ""She was just so crazy!"" said Dakota."	3
"Soda. Pop. Cola. Fizz. Whatever name it's called, millions of kids across the country are drinking it. Could that be bad for kids' health? In January, the doctors warned school officials of the dangers of sugared drinks. The doctors say those drinks are part of the reason so many kids are very overweight, or obese. Studies show that more than three times as many kids are overweight today as were 30 years ago. The doctors are asking schools to ban, or stop, the sale of soft drinks in vending machines. They suggest that the vending machines offer more healthful choices-such as water, real fruit and vegetable juices, and low-fat milk. Soft-drink makers see the obesity problem differently. They say the main reason that kids are overweight is a lack of exercise. ""Soft drinks can be part of a balanced lifestyle and are a nice treat,"" said one spokesperson. The chart shows the percentage of overweight kids in certain years. For example, from 1971 to 1974, four of every 100 kids were overweight. At lunchtime today, my friends and I heard some fifth graders swearing. We think we should tell the principal, but we're afraid that the older kids will find out. They might become angry and pick on us. What should we do?"	3
"A peanut allergy is one type of food allergy. A food allergy is when the body has a strong reaction to a certain food. Eleven-year-old Chris Conetta is allergic to peanuts. If he eats peanuts, he gets very sick. ""My face and my tongue swell up, and I can't breathe,"" he said. Kids like Chris can have an allergic reaction from eating just a tiny amount of peanuts or a food made with peanut oil. Even smelling or touching peanuts can make some kids sick. About 7 million Americans have food allergies. These eight foods are the cause of most food allergies: The peanut hunt is not over yet. Now scientists are looking for a peanut missing the other allergen. Once they find it, they will try to create an allergy-free peanut. Scientists hope an allergy-free peanut will one day replace the more common peanut. That would make kids with peanut allergies very happy. ""Chris always has to be careful of everything he eats,"" said his mom. ""If he didn't have to do that, it would be wonderful!"" Chris agrees. ""I could have a peanut butter and jelly sandwich. I miss them."""	3
"Valentine's Day and the U.S. Postal Service have more in common than you'd think. Each year, the Postal Service issues a new ""love"" stamp for Valentine's Day.This year, the Postal Service is selling candy stamps. Although you can't eat the stamp, it is sweet looking. The stamp shows a picture of two candy hearts with a message that says ""I love you. ""The NECCO candy company has been making the popular candy hearts since the 1800s. ""Our hearts have been passed down from generation to generation,"" said the company president, ""and the new stamp is [proof of] our candy's place in U.S. history."""	3
Along with new colors, there will be a few other changes to the $20 bill. For example, the oval around the image of Andrew Jackson will be removed. Jackson was the seventh U.S. president. For a closer look at the new bill, visit www.weeklyreader.com/kids/grade3/links	3
"In 1992, boxes of the toys fell off a ship in the Pacific Ocean. The toys made their way to the Arctic Ocean. For years, they were trapped there by ice. Recently, the toys have floated toward the Atlantic Ocean. With the help of computers, scientists can predict where the toys are heading. Scientists believe many of the lost toys will wash up on the northeast coast of the United States. The animals have the words the first years on them. That is the name of the company that made them. The company is offering a $100 U.S. savings bond to anyone who finds a lost toy. The rewards are being offered in the name of science. The toys are helping scientists track the patterns of ocean currents. An ocean current is a flow of water in the ocean. Each year, about 10,000 shipments fall overboard. ""When trash goes into the ocean, it doesn't disappear,"" said one ocean expert. ""It just goes somewhere else."" Some trash gets eaten by ocean creatures and birds that mistake it for food. Other trash washes up on shore."	3
"They discovered an old ship, the SS Republic, on the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean. The ship sank in a hurricane in 1865. Reports say that 20,000 gold coins went down with the ship. Today, experts say, the coins may be worth up to 180 million dollars. If so, that would make it the richest treasure ever found in a shipwreck. The team also plans to recover artifacts. Artifacts are objects made by people long ago. ""The [recovery] we are planning will focus on bringing the story of this amazing ship back to life,"" said one explorer."	3
"This year marks the 50th anniversary of a famous decision that changed American history. It all started with a court case called Brown v. Board of Education. In 1951, Linda Brown from Topeka, Kansas, was in third grade. She was one of many African American kids who were forced to attend schools separate from those for white students. Linda's school was miles away from her home. She was not allowed to attend a whites-only school that was just a few blocks away. Linda's parents and 12 other families sued the Kansas school system. The case was taken all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court. Today, Linda Brown is grown up. She travels around the country to speak about the case. She recently told an audience, ""Little did my father know that when he stepped off the witness stand, he stepped into the history pages."""	3
"The blackout was caused by a power grid failure. A power grid is a system that controls the flow of electricity. In many places, the electricity was out for 48 hours. The power came back on, but the problem is not over. Experts say a future blackout is possible. They say that the grid is carrying more electricity than it can handle. President George W. Bush called the power failure a ""wake-up call."" He said that the power system is old and needs to be fixed. Officials are trying to come up with ways to solve the problem. One idea is to build new power lines. Another idea is to update the old system. The goal is the same: to prevent future blackouts."	3
"A recent study shows that heavy packs can lead to bad posture (POS-chuhr). Posture is the way you hold your body when you stand, sit, or walk. Thirteen kids aged 8 and 9 took part in the study. Experts found that the kids could not stand straight when their packs were heavy. The heavier the pack, the more the kids bent forward. ""Their chins [were] on their chests,"" said one expert. What's a kid to do? Try to lighten up! Doctors say most third graders should not carry packs that weigh more than 8 pounds. Any more than that is just extra baggage!"	3
When Columbus died in 1506, his remains were placed in a box. The box was first buried in Spain. It was later moved to the Dominican Republic. That is an island in the Caribbean Sea. It is where Columbus wanted to be buried. The Dominican Republic was once under Spanish rule. When Spain lost control of the island, officials moved the box again. Spain claims to have the explorer's remains. But so does the Dominican Republic. People have been arguing about it for 100 years! Scientists recently opened the box in Spain where Columbus is thought to be buried. They are now doing tests on the bones found there. The scientists hope to finally settle the argument.	3
Every four years, Americans make a big decision. They vote for the person they want to be the president of the United States. The president will be elected on November 2. That is Election Day. Even though that day is months away, candidates are busy trying to win votes. Those candidates are people running for the office of the presidency. Chances are you are already familiar with one of the candidates. He is the current U.S. president, George W. Bush. He is serving a four-year term. The president can be elected to serve up to two terms in office. President Bush is the Republican candidate. The Republican party is one of the two major political groups in our country. The other major party is the Democratic party. Nine people want to be the one chosen as the Democratic candidate for president. To do so, they have to beat the other Democratic candidates in special, smaller elections that begin this January. The candidate the Democrats choose will run against President Bush in November. Then it will be up to the American people to decide.	3
"In the world of sports, it takes talent and hard work to succeed. Here are a few female athletes who play hard and inspire others. Michelle Wie may be young, but she is already playing golf with the pros. In January, the 14-year-old became the youngest player to compete in a PGA (Professional Golf Association) tour event. As one of the few females to play on the tour, Wie proved she could compete against the male golfers. ""I think I learned that I can play here, but I have to work harder on my game to be in the winner's circle,"" she said. Basketball star Lisa Leslie has got game! Since 1997, she has been playing hoops for the Los Angeles Sparks. She is a top scorer and has led her team to many wins. Leslie was a member of the gold medal-winning U.S. women's teams at the 1996 and 2000 Summer Olympics. This August, she will compete in the 2004 Olympics. Leslie is confident the U.S. team will win again. ""I'm looking forward to winning another gold medal,"" she said. Hannah Teter began snowboarding in third grade. Today, the teen is considered one of the top female snowboarders in the world! Since turning pro in 2002, Teter has won many competitions. ""I'm on a roll,"" she said after winning an event in December. ""It's been crazy."" This January, she won a gold medal at the X Games in Colorado. Teter's dream is to compete in the 2006 Olympics. Graceful. Artistic. Talented. Those are some words people use to describe figure skater Michelle Kwan. This January, she won the U.S. ladies' figure-skating championship for the eighth time! Kwan won Olympic medals in 1998 and 2002, but she has yet to win a gold medal. Does she plan to compete at the Winter Olympics in 2006? Kwan says the chances are very good. I decided to play basketball with some of my classmates during recess yesterday. Now my friend Kara is angry at me because I didn't hang out with her. I tried to speak to her, but she is now ignoring me. What should I do? In what other areas have women made history? Can you name any of these woman?"	3
"""Before the war, there were 650 animals. Afterward, just 13 remained,"" said the zoo director. Many of the animals died. Others escaped or were stolen. The animals that survived were starving and sick. Many of their cages were damaged. When wildlife groups found out, they offered a helping hand. The groups donated money, medicine, and food. Those efforts helped return the animals to good health. Today, the zoo is home to about 80 animals. They include lions, monkeys, and bears. U.S. soldiers now guard the zoo to protect the animals. Location: Iraq is a country located in Asia. It is in an area known as the Middle East. Language: Most of the people in Iraq are Arabs. They speak Arabic, the official language of Iraq. In July, the zoo reopened its doors to visitors. To the people of Iraq, the zoo is a welcome sight. ""I've been mostly inside the house for the last few months,"" said an 11-year-old girl in Iraq. ""I missed things like this."" Many people think the zoo brings hope for Iraq. ""There's a war going on around us, but here, everything is going well,"" said one rescue worker. ""It's an island of peace in a war zone."" A smaller group of people in Iraq are Kurds. Most Kurds speak Kurdish."	3
Bright blue. Fire red. Neon yellow. The bright colors of poison dart frogs warn other animals that the frogs are not safe to eat. Their skin contains poison that may kill animals that eat them. The scientists collected insects from the area where the frogs live. They found ants containing the same poison as the frogs. Scientists found the same ants in the stomachs of the frogs. After eating the ants, those frogs use the poison to protect themselves.	3
"For centuries, people have told stories about the lost island of Atlantis. It is said that the people of Atlantis were very wealthy and that the ancient island gleamed with gold and silver. Then one day, the stories go, the island suddenly sank to the ocean floor. Is Atlantis real or a myth? A myth is an old, made-up story. One team of explorers believe Atlantis is real. They claim to have found the remains of the lost island. The explorers say the remains are on the bottom of the Mediterranean Sea, buried under sediment. (See the map.) ""We hope that future expeditions will be able to uncover the sediment and bring back physical proof,"" said one explorer. Other experts are unsure whether the remains are those of Atlantis. This is not the first time people have believed they had found the lost island. Until someone is able to prove it, the mystery will continue."	3
A new video game is helping kids who need some cheering up. It is called Ben's Game. The game was named after its creator--9-year-old Ben Duskin. Ben found out he had cancer four years ago. Cancer is a serious disease that can make people very sick. For the past year, Ben has been feeling much better. When Ben was in the hospital, video games helped take his mind off being sick. That gave him the idea to help other kids who have cancer. To make his dream come true, Ben's parents asked the Make-A-Wish Foundation to help. The foundation worked with Ben to create his game. The object is to blast cancer cells. Ben's Game is available free online. You can check it out by going to our Web site: www.weeklyreader.com/wish.	3
"U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service Wildlife experts have a reason to cheer. A recent report says that the number of bald eagles in Maryland is soaring. In fact, many states are reporting the same good news. Forty years ago, bald eagles were in danger of disappearing in the United States. Chemicals used for farming were to blame, say experts. Farmers are no longer allowed to use those chemicals. Experts say that is the main reason there are more bald eagles alive today. ""The recovery started slowly and then has increased in leaps and bounds since the 1990s,"" said one scientist. In 1977, only 200 bald eagles lived in Maryland. Today more than 2,000 bald eagles live there!"	3
"Inauguration Day is filled with events from morning to night. Some are serious, and others are just plain fun! Here are some of the day's top events. George W. Bush first took the Oath of Office in 2001. That is when he became the 43rd U.S. president. The oath is the only part of the day's events that is required by law. Every president since George Washington has taken this oath. In 1961, John F. Kennedy gave one of the most famous inaugural addresses. Kennedy was the 35th president of the United States. He said, ""Ask not what your country can do for you; ask what you can do for your country."" What do you think his message meant? In 1977, Jimmy Carter was the first U.S. president to walk in the inaugural parade. The parade starts at the Capitol and ends at the White House. The White House is the president's home for the next four years. Every president except George Washington has lived there. An inaugural ball is a formal dance. The first official ball was held in 1809 for President James Madison. So far, no president has attended more inaugural balls than President Bill Clinton in 1997. He and First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton attended 14 in one night!"	3
"Thomas Jefferson is getting a makeover--on the nickel. The coin will have a larger image of the third U.S. president. This is the first time his image has been updated since being put on the coin in 1938. The other side of the coin will also get a new look. The image of Jefferson's home in Virginia will be removed. In its place will be one of two new designs--a picture of a buffalo or a view of the ocean. The coins are part of the Westward Journey Nickel Series. ""The 2005 nickel designs follow Thomas Jefferson's vision to explore the Great West,"" said the director of the U.S. Mint."	3
"A large asteroid recently zoomed very close to Earth. The space rock came within a million miles of our planet. That may sound like a great distance, but in outer space it is only a hop, skip, and a jump away. The asteroid is named Toutatis. It is about 3 miles long and 1½ miles wide. Scientists say the mountain-size asteroid has a very odd shape. Some scientists think it looks like an unshelled peanut; others say it looks like a potato or even a bowling pin. Many smaller asteroids have been spotted much closer to Earth. However, Toutatis is the largest-known asteroid to come so close to our planet. Was Toutatis a danger to Earth? Not at all, say scientists. They have been tracking the asteroid for more than 10 years. ""What this flyby provides is an opportunity to study one of our closest solar system neighbors,"" said one scientist. Toutatis has been tumbling through space for billions of years. The asteroid will not come this close to Earth for more than 500 years."	3
Some projects take longer than others. The Crazy Horse Memorial in South Dakota is one of them. Workers started carving the giant rock sculpture in 1948. They are still working on it today. The memorial honors Chief Crazy Horse. Native American leaders chose to honor him because he was one of their heroes. Chief Crazy Horse was a Native American who fought for his people's right to their land and traditions. When will the sculpture be finished? No one knows for sure. All that matters is that it's going forward, said the project manager.	3
"What advice would you give to the next president of the United States? Hundreds of kids had a lot of ideas. They wrote letters of advice to George W. Bush and John Kerry. The letter program is taking place at a library in Massachusetts. Kids who can't go to that library can write letters online. The kids had many things to say. ""Please make world peace and stop world hunger,"" wrote Luke, 9, from Florida. Eight-year-old Megan from Georgia wrote, ""I hope you try your hardest to help our country."" A selection of letters will be sent to each candidate. ""The kids want to be heard,"" said one library staff member."	3
What is Unaysaurus tolentinoi? It may sound like a tongue twister, but it is actually a new species of dinosaur. Scientists recently finished a replica, or model, of the dinosaur. The dinosaur's fossils were discovered in 1998 in South America. Fossils are ancient remains of plants or animals. Scientists spent almost six years cleaning the bones and putting them together. After studying the fossils, scientists learned that the dinosaur lived about 225 million years ago. It was one of the first two-legged plant-eating dinosaurs on Earth! Scientists say the new species is related to dinosaurs that lived in what is now Europe. The discovery supports the idea of a supercontinent called Pangaea (pan-JEE-ah). Scientists believe that when dinosaurs first appeared on Earth, all land was joined together and that it later split into continents.	3
Many kids play the piÃ±ata game on Cinco de Mayo. PiÃ±atas are filled with treats. The fifth day of the fifth month of 2005 is no ordinary day. It is the holiday Cinco de Mayo! That is the Spanish name for the fifth of May. Cinco de Mayo marks the victory of the Mexican army over the French army in a battle on May 5, 1862. The holiday is not Mexico's Independence Day, as people often believe. Many people in Mexico and the United States celebrate this holiday with a fiesta. Fiesta is the Spanish word for party. At Cinco de Mayo fiestas, kids and adults celebrate Mexican culture through food, music, costume, and dance. A proper noun names a specific person, place, or thing. Proper nouns start with a capital letter. Choose five proper nouns in this story.	3
What is a three-letter word for trouble? Flu! That is short for influenza (in-floo-EN-zah). The flu is caused by a virus that can be passed easily from person to person. People who catch the virus often have fevers, sore muscles, and coughs. Doctors say the best way to keep from getting the virus is to get a flu shot. However, this year there weren't enough flu shots for everyone. Health experts found that one company's flu shots weren't safe. That company was supposed to supply the United States with half of the 100 million doses needed. This year, there were not enough flu shots for everyone. The people at highest risk received a flu shot first. Hang in there! The flu strikes the United States for only part of the year. Flu season usually runs from November to March. Germs! Ick! Despite the short supply of flu shots, there are ways to stay flu-free. To keep the virus away, practice healthful habits.	3
"What's the recipe for having fun with math and nutrition? Learn to cook! More children are in the kitchen thanks to a kid-friendly cooking world. TV chefs, such as Emeril Lagasse, show that cooking can be cool. His recipes always end with a ""Bam!"" Cooking classes for kids have also become popular. What makes those classes such a hit? The secret ingredient is that kids learn to safely use real utensils, or cooking tools. The young chefs say that their favorite part of class is that they get to munch on their own meals!"	3
"Whap! Fourteen-year-old Steven Shin from Cleveland, Ohio, hits a tennis ball over the net. He has been playing in tennis tournaments since the age of 8. This July, he plans to compete for a medal in the International Children's Games, also known as the Children's Olympics. ""Whenever you watch the real Olympics on TV, you root for your country,"" Steven told Weekly Reader. ""I have a firsthand opportunity to represent the U.S.A. Instead of watching the games, I actually get to be the athlete this time."" About 1,500 athletes, ages 12 to 15, from nearly 50 countries will take part in the competition. This year, it is being hosted by, or held in, Coventry, England. From July 6 through 11, athletes will compete in tennis, soccer, track and field, swimming, and table tennis. During their stay, the young athletes will live in an Olympic-style athletes' village. There, they will have the chance to learn more about one another and make new friends. ""There will be differences, but I'm sure there are going to be a lot of things that we have in common,"" said Steven. The International Children's Games were first held in 1968 as a way to promote, or help develop, peace and friendship through sports. Since that time, more than 27,000 kids from around the world have participated. The International Children's Games are modeled after the Olympics. The Olympic Games have a long history:"	3
Taking those first baby steps is very exciting—especially for a robot. For years, scientists have worked to create a robot that could walk in a humanlike way. That time has finally arrived! This February, scientists unveiled three robots that can walk like humans. The robots swing their arms for balance, as people do. The new robots require far less power than earlier versions did. Toddler is the most advanced of the three. It learns to walk like a toddler, or a young child. Its balance improves with each step. The walking robots are more than just toys. In the future, robots like these may be used to perform dangerous space missions. The discoveries could also help scientists develop better robotic limbs for people who have lost their arms or legs.	3
Thousands of Native Americans gathered together on September 21. They were in Washington, D.C., for the grand opening of a museum. It is called the National Museum of the American Indian. Visitors are sure to feel welcome when they enter the museum. A welcome wall greets them in 150 Native American languages. The museum is filled with paintings and artifacts. Artifacts are objects made by people long ago. Some of the artifacts include baskets, dolls, and pottery. Many Native American tribes helped design the new museum. Museum officials say it gives Native Americans a chance to tell their story.	3
"Floodwater recently exploded from Glen Canyon Dam in Arizona. The water gushed down the Colorado River and into the Grand Canyon. A canyon is a long, narrow valley with high cliffs on each side. Scientists released water from the dam to move 1 million tons of sediment down the Colorado River. Sediment is sand and soil carried by water. Scientists hope the sediment will collect on beaches and sandbars to save endangered fish and plants. Sandbars are ridges of sand formed by moving water. Glen Canyon Dam is a wall that people built across the Colorado River. It was made to store water and generate electricity. When it began operating in 1963, it stopped the flow of river water and most of the sediment. Without new sediment, beaches and sandbars started washing away. Plants growing along the beaches began to die off. Many young fish that depend on sandbars to survive started to die off too. During the next two years, scientists will study the effects of the flooding. ""The Grand Canyon is one of the unique natural areas in the world,"" scientist Denny Fenn told Weekly Reader. ""It deserves protection. Anything we can do to save it, the better off we'll be."" What might happen if Glen Canyon Dam were removed? Why?"	3
"U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service As the tallest animals in the world, giraffes have a great view of the zoo. Scientists recently had an even better view--from 280 miles above Earth! Animals at the Bronx Zoo in New York City were tracked from outer space with a satellite. A satellite is a spacecraft that orbits a planet or moon. The satellite took images of different species of zoo animals and sent the images back to Earth. A species is a group of plants or animals that are alike in certain ways. Scientists studied the images to see how well the satellite could spot different species. So far, scientists are pleased with the results. They hope to use the satellite to track endangered animals in faraway places in the wild. Endangered animals are at risk of becoming extinct, or dying out completely. Currently, people track animals either by foot or by airplane. Scientists think that using a satellite to track animals will be both easier and cheaper. Along with counting endangered animals, scientists want to learn where they migrate. When animals migrate, they move from one place to another. Why do scientists want to learn where animals migrate? ""[We want to know where to] create national parks and other protected areas for endangered animals,"" said Bergen. Would you want to be a scientist who studies endangered animals? Explain your answer."	3
"""A day on, not a day off!"" Since 1994, that has been the slogan for Martin Luther King Jr. Day. Many students have the holiday off from school. Kids at Greene Street Friends School in Pennsylvania, however, will make it ""a day on."" The kids will sew quilts for needy infants and pack meals for elderly people. ""I like that I'm helping people,"" 10-year-old Justine Baird told Weekly Reader. The students at Greene Street Friends School are among the thousands of kids across the country who will take part in community service projects. The projects honor King's memory. King was an African American leader who devoted his life to improving the lives of others. He once said, ""Everybody can be great, because everybody can serve."" When King was growing up in the South, African Americans did not have the same rights as white people. African Americans had to live in separate neighborhoods and send their kids to separate schools. Some African Americans were not allowed to vote. Many Americans felt that such laws were unfair. When King was older, he gave speeches and led peaceful marches to try to change those laws. As a result of King's work, civil rights laws were passed. Those laws protect the rights of all Americans."	3
"Don't mess with a Budgett's frog! When scared, it puffs up with air, opens its big mouth, and screams. The frog also bites if it is picked up. (Yikes!) The Budgett's frog is just one of the many frogs at the American Museum of Natural History in New York City. More than 200 live frogs are on exhibit there until January 2005. A frog is an amphibian (am-FI-bee-ahn). An amphibian is an animal that spends part of its life in water and part on land. Scientists are concerned about the survival of these amphibians. They say that the number of frogs around the world has been shrinking. Some species, or types, of frog have already died off. ""What has us really worried is that many frog species are disappearing, and we don't know why,"" museum scientist Taran Grant told Weekly Reader. Experts say disease or pollution may be to blame. However, no one really knows for sure. ""We had two goals in putting together this exhibit,"" said Grant. ""One goal was to expose people to the variety of frogs in the world. The other was to teach people about the threats to their survival."" Is it important to learn the reason frogs are disappearing? Why?"	3
"German scientists recently made a discovery that was music to their ears. They unearthed, or dug up, a 35,000-year-old flute in a cave! It is one of the world's oldest known musical instruments. The flute was made from an ivory tusk of a woolly mammoth. Woolly mammoths were hairy, elephant-like creatures with long, curved tusks. They lived during the Ice Age. That is a period of time from 2 million to 11,000 years ago, when snow and ice covered much of Earth. People who lived during the Ice Age are best known for their hunting skills. The new discovery suggests that they were also artistic and fond of music. ""Ivory was the most beautiful material available back then,"" said one scientist. ""It's a clear clue that music was extremely important."""	3
Don't let their tiny size fool you. Chipmunks are tougher than they look! Scientists recently learned that relatives of modern-day chipmunks survived the last ice age. That was a period of time when snow and ice covered much of Earth. The last ice age happened about 18,000 years ago. Until recently, scientists thought that most small animals escaped the cold by moving south to warmer areas. However, a new study shows that some chipmunks stayed in the north. During the last ice age, chipmunks lived in areas of forest near the edges of ice sheets. Those areas escaped being covered by ice, say scientists.	3
Are potato chips, soft drinks, and cookies part of your diet? If you're like many kids, the answer is yes. Health experts say that Americans are eating too much junk food. It makes up almost one-quarter of the American diet! The U.S. government is helping people change their eating habits. More than half of Americans are overweight. Being overweight can lead to health problems. In a recent report, the government said people should eat foods that are higher in nutrients and lower in fat. Nutrients give you energy and help your body stay healthy. Some foods that are good sources of nutrients are fruits, vegetables, and whole grains, such as brown rice and whole-wheat bread. A healthful diet is not the only way people can keep their bodies fit. The new guidelines say kids should exercise for at least one hour a day. If you think eating healthful foods is boring, think again! Nutritious foods can be fun and tasty. Just ask the kids at Meadowbrook Elementary School in Fort Worth, Texas. They recently taste-tested foods, such as sweet potato pancakes and blueberry burgers. The U.S. Department of Agriculture held the taste test. That group wants to help schools find ways to serve healthful foods and meet the new dietary guidelines. Experts say that kids are eating too much sugar. If you look at a food label, you might have trouble spotting the sugar. That's because sugar can have many different names. Here are some of them:	3
"How will you celebrate Earth Day on April 22? Thousands of kids and adults around the world will make a splash by taking part in a program called ""Dive Into Earth Day."" They will clean up beaches, help scientists count fish, and learn about ways to protect Earth's waters. Spokesperson Florence Depondt told Weekly Reader, ""We need to protect our oceans."" Trash thrown on beaches can end up in the ocean and injure or kill marine life. Animals such as fish and sea turtles often mistake trash for food and choke on these items. ""Everyone can take a stand to protect their local marine environments,"" said Depondt. ""Taking care of water resources should be every day, not just Earth Day!"""	3
"Lily Thorpe from Colorado is one busy 11-year-old! She recently started a group called Kids Campaign. Lily meets with elected officials and speaks with them about kids' causes. (Elected officials are people who are voted into office.) Why did Lily start Kids Campaign? She noticed that many of her school library books were very old. To help schools in Colorado get money for books and other supplies they need, she decided to take action. In the name of children everywhere, Lily is making her voice heard. ""Kids weren't getting enough of a say in politics,"" Lily told Weekly Reader. ""Grown-ups who vote are making the decision for us. Kids can have a voice."""	3
This summer, more than 300 third graders in Georgia had a special job to do. They helped greet world leaders! The leaders were taking part in the G8 Summit. A summit is a meeting. G8 stands for Group of Eight. It is made up of the leaders of eight countries: Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Russia, the United Kingdom, and the United States. Each year, the leaders of those countries meet to discuss issues facing the world. Those issues include peace, freedom, and health. The leaders work together to come up with ways to make the world a safer and better place. The leaders take turns hosting the G8 Summit in their home countries. This year, George W. Bush was the host. In 2005, the leader of the United Kingdom will host the meeting.	3
"A group of 21 kids has come to the rescue! These second and third graders at Mintz Elementary School in Florida spent the past few months working on a special project. They collected money, food, clothing, and other items for hurricane victims. A hurricane is a large, powerful storm that forms over an ocean. A hurricane has strong winds and a lot of rain. When a hurricane moves over land, it can cause a lot of damage. Between August and late September, four hurricanes hit Florida. The storms left many people without electricity. Some families even lost their homes. Students at Mintz Elementary wanted to help those families. They donated hundreds of items and more than $2,000 to the Red Cross! That is an organization that helps people in need. ""I like to help people,"" said 7-year-old Garrett Surber, a student at Mintz. ""It makes me feel happy that they will be OK."""	3
"What do 450 kids from 50 countries have in common? A whole lot! The kids were involved in helping Earth. They came together for the International Children's Conference on the Environment. It was held this summer in New London, Connecticut. Weekly Reader caught up with the kids during the weeklong conference. The week was filled with many activities and field trips. There was also a lot of music, dancing, and singing. Check it out! In India, they teach people to plant trees and conserve, or save, water. They told the audience: ""Water is life! Conserve it!"" What did many kids like best about the conference? Making friends from countries around the world! ""It's fun,"" said Federico Gonzalez, 11, from Colombia. ""You get to know people who speak different languages."" Everyone loves a parade--of flags! During the conference, the kids took part in a special flag ceremony. Some of the children dressed in costumes to represent their countries. They walked with their national flags held high. Some kids also performed dances and music of their homelands. Parade of Flags. Some children dressed in costumes to represent their countries and walked with their national flags. Meet a woman who knows chimps. Her name is Jane Goodall. She is a scientist who is famous for her research on chimpanzees. Goodall spoke at the conference. To get the attention of the audience, she made chimp noises! (It was wild!) Today, Goodall travels the world and gives talks about the environment and peace. She encouraged the children to make the world a better place. Her advice: ""Get involved and do something!"""	3
Each year, Weekly Reader hears from kids who have saved lives by using the Heimlich (HIGHM-lik) maneuver. That is a special move that can save the life of a person who is choking. Ten-year-old Emily Hartman of Michigan saved her mother's life last year. Emily's mother was eating breakfast. She took a big bite of cereal and started to choke. That is when Emily jumped into action and performed the Heimlich maneuver. It worked, and her mother was able to breathe again. 1. Stand behind the choking person and wrap your arms around his or her waist. 2. Make a fist and hold it against the person's stomach, about halfway between the belly button and the rib cage. 3. Grab your fist with your other hand. Press it in with an upward thrust. Repeat until the person stops choking.	3
The life cycle of a frog is amazing. Read below to learn more. (Note: Although many frogs have this life cycle, others do not. Some frogs don't even have tadpoles; instead their eggs hatch directly into frogs!) 1. A frog begins life as a tiny egg, usually in or near water. 2. After about 10 days, a tadpole hatches from the egg. It breathes using gills and moves like a fish. 3. After about five weeks, the tadpole's gills disappear, and it grows lungs. 4. At about 12 weeks, the young frog grows legs, and its tail disappears. It leaves the water and can live on land. U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service 5. In about one year, the frog is a full-grown adult. Soon, the cycle will begin again.	3
"Music. Rain. Footsteps. Giggles. Think about all the sounds you would miss if you could not hear. Eight-year-old Lily Davidson from Scotland once could not hear those sounds. That has all changed. Lily became deaf as a baby. Four years ago, she received a special device to help her hear. It is called a bionic ear. Now Lily is at the top of her class in reading and writing. She also plays the violin and hopes to earn a spot in her school orchestra. Doctors inserted the bionic ear during an operation. Before she goes to sleep, Lily turns off her bionic ear. ""It's cool because I can't hear when there is noise,"" she said. ""Other people have to worry about it, but [noise doesn't bother me]!"" How does Lily's bionic ear work? People hear when sound waves travel to a bone in the ear. It is called the cochlea (KOH-klee-ah). The cochlea changes sound to electrical signals. They are sent to the brain. Lily's bionic ear lets sound waves skip over the cochlea. Doesn't that sound cool?"	3
"What grumbles, growls, and stands almost 14,000 feet high? It is Mauna Loa, the world's largest volcano. Scientists say it is getting ready to erupt again. Mauna Loa covers half of Hawaii's largest island. Thousands of people live on the volcano's slopes. If the volcano erupts, lava could destroy their homes. Lava is hot, melted rock that pours out of a volcano. When lava cools, it forms solid rock. The last time Mauna Loa erupted was 20 years ago. A stream of lava flowed out of the volcano for three weeks. The lava stopped only a few miles away from a large city just as people were getting ready to evacuate, or go to a safer place. To help protect people living on Mauna Loa, scientists keep close track of the volcano. Since July, they have recorded more than 350 earthquakes deep beneath Mauna Loa. Before a volcano erupts, hundreds of earthquakes can take place each day within the volcano. ""We know that Mauna Loa will erupt,"" volcano scientist Frank Trusdell told Weekly Reader. However, no one knows exactly when that will occur. ""I would say it will be at least a year away,"" he predicted. Until then, scientists will keep the public informed. ""If the volcano catches anyone by surprise, then we aren't doing our jobs,"" said Trusdell. Mauna Loa is not the only volcano in the news. At the time Weekly Reader went to press, Mount St. Helens in Washington state was also awakening. The last time Mount St. Helens erupted was in 1980. It was such a large eruption that it blew the top off the mountain. A new eruption would most likely be much smaller, say scientists. Would you want to be a volcano scientist? Why?"	3
Time flies! Election Day is only a few days away. On November 2, millions of Americans will head to the polls. Their votes will decide who will be president of the United States for the next four years. Both George W. Bush and John Kerry want to win the election and become the next president. However, that was not always the case. As kids, both candidates dreamed of being sports stars. President Bush was born in New Haven, Connecticut, on July 6, 1946. His family moved to Texas not long after he was born. As a child, Bush wanted to become a baseball player. One of his hobbies was collecting baseball cards. He had many of his cards signed by the best players of the time. Before being elected president in 2000, Bush was a part owner of the Texas Rangers baseball team. He also was governor of Texas for six years. Senator Kerry was born in Denver, Colorado, on December 11, 1943. A few months later, his family moved to Massachusetts. As a child, Kerry wanted to become a hockey player. He also thought about becoming a football player. His interest in sports continued through the years. During college, he played hockey, soccer, and lacrosse. As he grew up, Kerry began to think about public service. He has been a U.S. senator from Massachusetts for the past 20 years. What do you dream of doing when you grow up? Why?	3
"The job of secretary of state is very important. That person works with the governments of other countries. ""The secretary of state is America's face to the world,"" said Bush. ""And in [Condoleezza Rice], the world will see the strength, grace, and decency of our country."" For the past four years, Rice was the national security adviser. Her job was to give the president advice on how to keep the country safe. ""It is an honor to be asked to serve ... my country once again,"" said Rice."	3
"Cha-ching! The sound of money was heard loud and clear this August at the World's Fair of Money. It was held in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. One billion dollars' worth of coins were at the fair. The money was available for buying and selling. Some coins cost less than a dollar. Other coins were worth millions. Eight-year-old Sam Zurenski and his grandfather were among the visitors. Sam's grandfather collected coins when he was a boy. Now he is helping Sam build his own collection. For many people, it's the story behind the coin that has them collecting. ""Every piece of money has a story to tell,"" said one coin expert. ""Money... is history you can hold in your hand."""	3
Think you're growing up fast? That is nothing compared with how fast the Tyrannosaurus rex, or T. rex, grew! A team of scientists recently discovered how the dinosaur got so big: T. rex had a huge burst of growth as a teenager. After studying T. rex bones, the team learned that the dinosaur grew very large, very quickly. At age 13, T. rex weighed about a ton. (A ton is equal to 2,000 pounds.) Between the ages of 14 and 18, T. rex gained almost 5 pounds a day. By age 18, the dinosaur weighed a whopping 4 tons! T. rex lived to about 30 years of age. As an adult, the dinosaur reached its full weight of 6 tons. That is huge! Scientists say T. rex had to eat a lot to grow so fast. What was the meat-eating giant's favorite food? Scientists are still trying to figure that out.	3
"First you hear the beat of the drum. Then the voices of the Quabbin Lake Singers all join in chorus. They sing in a language you probably have not heard before. It is a Native American language called Nipmuc. The Quabbin Lake Singers are members of the Mann family. The group is made up of three brothers and their parents. They are Native Americans from the Historical Nipmuc tribe in Massachusetts. Weekly Reader saw the family perform this summer at a powwow in Connecticut. A powwow is a Native American celebration. Eight-year-old Nantai (NAN-tigh) and his brothers, ages 7 and 9, are typical boys. They go to public school, play video games, and skateboard. Every Saturday, the family practices drumming and singing. ""The boys look forward to it,"" said their dad. ""They love their drum."" Some of the songs they perform are very old. They also write their own songs. During the summer and other school vacations, the family travels around the United States and Canada. They perform their songs and share their culture. A person's culture is his or her way of life, ideas, and traditions. Native Americans were the first people living in North America and South America. They have lived there for thousands of years. Women play a very important role in Native American culture."	3
"Imagine if recess were no longer part of your school day. If you are like most kids, you are probably thinking, ""No recess? No way!"" However, some students have no choice. For them, recess is over. Clark County School District in Nevada recently put an end to recess. It is one of many school districts across the country to get rid of recess time. Why? School officials say they want students to have more time to learn. They also hope that more time in class will help students perform better on tests. Should schools stop having recess? Why or why not? Many teachers, parents, and students do not agree with the decision to eliminate, or take away, recess. ""Recess is important so kids get a break from sitting at their desks,"" said one principal from Virginia. ""They get up and move. They can visit with their friends and have social time."" Many experts say that having recess is worth the lost class time. Recess gives kids the chance to exercise. At recess, many students also learn how to play and work together with other students. Some studies even show a recess break can help improve test scores. ""If we had a longer school day, we would love to have recess,"" said one school official. ""But we have more math to teach and more reading to do, and something had to go."" Exercise helps kids stay healthy. No recess break? Don't worry! You can get fit on your own time. Kids should exercise for an hour each day, say experts. Here are some ideas to get you moving:"	3
"Scientists were on the case! They collected clues. The scientists saw paw prints in the mud and fur on the bark of trees. What were they doing? Counting giant pandas! After four years, the detective work is done. During that time, scientists figured out how many pandas live in China. All wild giant pandas live in that country. ""Pandas are very hard to see in the wild,"" scientist Colby Loucks told Weekly Reader. ""They hide in the thick bamboo forests."" That is why scientists used clues to do the count. The result of the panda count was a surprise to scientists. They learned that hundreds more pandas exist than experts once thought! ""We found pandas living in areas we didn't know had any,"" said Loucks. Is it important to protect endangered animals? Why? Although the news is good, pandas remain endangered. That means they are in danger of dying out. The main threat to pandas is habitat loss. A habitat is a place in nature where an animal lives. Panda habitat is lost when people cut down parts of the forest for wood and farming. Currently, China has more than 40 giant panda nature centers. People are not allowed to cut down trees there. Scientists want to create more nature centers to give pandas a better chance for survival."	3
One at a time, visitors take turns crawling into a wooden box at a new museum in Cincinnati, Ohio. The museum is the National Underground Railroad Freedom Center. The box is like the one in which a slave hid in the 1840s so he could be shipped to freedom. The museum teaches visitors about the Underground Railroad. It was not actually a real railroad. It was a secret system of routes used to help slaves in the South escape to freedom in the North. Most runaway slaves traveled hundreds of miles. They hid during the day and fled at night. Along the way, they stopped at safe homes called stations. People at the stations provided slaves with food, clothing, and a place to rest.	3
"This October, U.S. soldiers from the Fort Lewis army base in Washington state had a chance to be kids for a day. They headed to nearby Boze Elementary School. There they spent the day with some second and third graders. The students and soldiers will be pen pals for the rest of the school year. Pen pals are friends who keep in touch by writing letters. A few days after meeting their new pen pals, the soldiers left for Iraq. That is a country in a part of Asia called the Middle East. The soldiers from Fort Lewis are part of the 140,000 U.S. troops serving in Iraq. They are working to help bring democracy to that country. A democracy is a type of government in which people choose their leader. The United States is a democracy. Iraq's previous leader, Saddam Hussein, was a dictator. A dictator is a ruler who has complete control over the country. Saddam ruled Iraq from 1979 until 2003. With the help of teachers, students will send letters to the Fort Lewis soldiers in Iraq once a month. They will also send care packages for the holidays. ""We wanted to support our troops,"" teacher's aide Bev McDonald told Weekly Reader. ""The pen pal project will give the soldiers something to look forward to."" Language: Most of the people in Iraq are Arabs. They speak Arabic, the official language of Iraq. A smaller group of people in Iraq are Kurds. Most Kurds speak Kurdish. Is it important for people to be able to choose their country's leader? Why or why not?"	3
Scientists in England didn't have a magic wand—yet they turned a cell phone into a sunflower! How did they do it? The cell phone's cover is made of a new plastic that decomposes, or rots, when it is buried in soil. Then a sunflower seed inside the cover grows into a flower. Scientists created the Earth-friendly plastic to help reduce the growing trash problem. This year more than 25 million cell phones will end up in the garbage. Along with the millions of other items people throw out, all of that trash adds up. Where does the garbage go? Most of it goes in landfills. A landfill is an area where trash is buried between layers of soil. Many cities and towns are running out of places to dump trash. Scientists hope the new phone cover will help lessen the need for landfills.	3
"Physical education teacher Marty Mentzer has put a new spin on poetry. She created the Basketball Poets club for fourth and fifth graders at Supply Elementary School in North Carolina. The Basketball Poets meet once a week to read, write, memorize, and perform poetry. Then they play basketball. Mentzer sees the club as a way for kids to keep their minds and bodies fit. ""I love poetry and sports,"" she told Weekly Reader. Poetry gives the kids a chance to express themselves. ""If you're nervous, you write a poem about being nervous. If you're happy, you write a poem about being happy,"" said Douglas Mitchell, 10. The students have also met two published poets—Kenn Nesbitt and Sharon Creech. Both children's book authors visited their school. ""They were professional and we're kids, so that's exciting,"" said 9-year-old Hannah Niles."	3
A-choo! Millions of people are allergic to cats. However, they soon may be able to have a pet cat without feeling sick. A company in California is developing cats that won't cause allergic reactions. An allergy is caused by the body's immune system. The immune system protects the body from disease. The body of a person with allergies mistakes ordinary things, such as cats, for germs. Scientists plan to turn off the part of the cats' cells that make the allergen. An allergen is the cause of an allergic reaction. The company hopes to have the kittens available by the year 2007.	3
On February 26, 15-year-old McKenzie Brooks from Alaska will take off for the finish line. She is competing in the Junior Iditarod (eye-DIT-ah-rod) Sled Dog Race. The Junior Iditarod is open to young mushers ages 14 to 17. A musher is a person who guides and cares for a team of dogs that pulls a sled. The 160-mile race takes place over a weekend. The first team to cross the finish line wins. The Junior Iditarod takes place on the weekend before the start of the Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race. That is the longest sled dog race in the world. It is open to mushers ages 18 and up. The Iditarod starts in the city of Anchorage and ends in the city of Nome. The race is about 1,150 miles long. It can take some teams more than two weeks to cross the finish line. Before mushing became Alaska's state sport, sled dogs served a very big role. They helped people get from place to place. Dog teams also carried mail and supplies. In 1925, sled dogs delivered lifesaving medicine from Anchorage to sick children in Nome. The Iditarod honors that event and the role the dog teams have played in Alaska's history. Would you want to take part in the Junior Iditarod race? Explain your answer.	3
"Fifteen-year-old Matthew Hector called on a crowd of20,000 people to fight world poverty. He was one of many people who spoke out at a recent rally, or a large meeting, in London, England. ""We believe the world should be fair so that everyone has the same opportunity to ... have a good life,"" he said. The rally launched a worldwide campaign called ""Make Poverty History."" The goal is to challenge world leaders to end poverty. People who live in poverty do not have enough money, food, and medical care for a healthy life. More than a billion people around the world are poor. About half of those people are children. Many of the poorest countries are in Africa. One of the most famous speakers at the rally was Nelson Mandela. He is the former president of South Africa. Mandela urged people to help those in need. He said, ""While [there is poverty], there is no true freedom."" In his speech, Mandela challenged world leaders not to ""look the other way"" from the problem of poverty. In July, leaders of the eight wealthiest countries, including the United States, will meet in Scotland. They have promised to take action to end poverty. Mandela and other supporters of ""Make Poverty History"" hope that world leaders keep their promise."	3
Meet the soon-to-be members of rescue teams--rats! Scientists are training the rodents to help find people who are buried in buildings after earthquakes and other disasters. Rats have a strong sense of smell, which can help them sniff out people. The rodents are also tiny enough to crawl just about anywhere. They can get into places that are too small for people and other animals, such as dogs. Scientists trained the rats to search for the scent of people. They attached tiny electronic devices to the brain of each rat. Signals from the rat's brain are sent to a radio that is strapped to the animal's back. Rescue teams will be able to track the signals and follow the rat's path. That will help them figure out where to start digging. Scientists hope to have the rat rescuers on the job within the next six months.	3
"Two eyes peer through the thick leaves and branches of a tree. The eyes belong to a 400-pound lowland gorilla that lives in Africa's Congo Basin. That is home to the second-largest rain forest in the world. The world's entire population of lowland gorillas live in the Congo Basin. Those creatures are among many species of endangered animals living in the rain forest. Scientists warn that more than half of the forest could disappear within 50 years. Some people illegally cut down trees and hunt wildlife to sell as meat. Many rain forest animals, like the lowland gorilla, are endangered because of illegal hunting. Help is on the way for the rain forest and the animals that live there. The presidents of 10 African countries recently signed a treaty, or agreement, to protect the rain forest. The WWF is a group that protects endangered animals and habitats. The WWF is helping Africa's governments stop illegal hunting and set up parks and protected areas for animals. ""This gives us a great opportunity to save the forest,"" said Carroll. Do you think people should be responsible for protecting animals and habitats? Why?"	3
"On May 30, Andrew Wallace from Maryland will put on his uniform and head to Washington, D.C. The 10-year-old is one of thousands of people who will march in the National Memorial Day Parade. The parade honors the men and women who died serving in the United States armed forces. Andrew is a member of the Young Marines, a service program for boys and girls. ""I'm going to be representing my [unit],"" Andrew explained to Weekly Reader. ""I think it's really cool."" The parade will also feature marching bands, color guards, military units, and large floats. This is the first time the National Memorial Day Parade will be held in the capital in more than 60 years. ""It's not just a parade for Washington, D.C. It's a parade for the whole country ... to honor those who have sacrificed so much to keep our country free,"" spokesperson Tim Holbert told Weekly Reader."	3
"How good are you at keeping a secret? Waldo Wilcox, 74, of Utah, kept one for more than 50 years! Until recently, people didn't know about the ancient Native American village on his land. ""I wanted to keep it the way it is,"" said Wilcox. Since Wilcox is no longer able to care for the land, he decided it was a good time to share his secret. The state of Utah now owns the land. Officials plan to make it open to the public. Experts say the village once belonged to the Fremont people. They lived in central and northern Utah more than 1,000 years ago. Scientists have found many artifacts at the site. Artifacts are objects made by people long ago. Some of the finds include arrowheads, beads, and pieces of pottery. Scientists hope the artifacts will teach them more about Fremont culture."	3
It's the holiday season! Many people throughout the world celebrate holidays at this time of year. Read the table to learn more about some of those holidays. Grown-ups don't eat food during the day. They eat one meal before the sun rises and another meal after the sun sets. Kids play the dreidel game. A dreidel is a spinning top. The winner often receives coins or candy. After taking part in a special parade, people have a party. Kids break open piñatas filled with treats. Kwanzaa is a celebration of family and African culture. Families light candles in a candleholder called a kinara.	3
Change is on the way for some school vending machines. Candy bars, sugary drinks, and other sweet snacks are no longer being offered in many schools. Those foods and drinks are being replaced with more healthful choices. Some of those choices include bottled water, salads, granola bars, and dried fruits and nuts. New York City has the largest school system in the country. That school system recently decided to ban, or not allow, junk food in its vending machines. Schools in Texas, California, and many other states are doing the same. Do you think schools should ban junk food from vending machines? Why or why not? Why are vending machines getting a makeover? Poor nutrition habits and a lack of exercise have caused many kids to become overweight. School officials hope the changes to vending machines will help students make better nutrition choices.	3
"U.S. Fish and Wildife Service Are you afraid of bats? If so, you are not alone. Many people are scared of the winged creatures. Bats often get a bad rap, but they are often helpful! Some farmers in California are thankful that bats live nearby. In fact, the farmers want more bats around! Why? The flying animals eat insects that come out at night. Without the bats, those insects would eat crops that farmers grow. Bats eat a lot of insects. One bat can eat hundreds of mosquitoes in an hour! Experts say a colony of big brown bats protects crops from 33 million bugs each summer. There are 45 species, or types, of bats in North America. Many of them are endangered, or in danger of dying out. ""Habitat loss is the number-one reason for the decline in bat species,"" scientist Rachael Long told Weekly Reader. ""People have no idea where bats live. They cut down trees, close up caves, and tear down old buildings where bats roost."" To attract more bats to the area, the farmers build bat houses. They hang the houses on barns and other buildings. Although farmers want more bats living near them, scientists warn that bats are still wild animals. ""If you see one, don't pick it up. They do bite,"" said Long. Even so, people should not fear bats. ""They are very social, really smart, and interesting creatures."" What other animals help people? How?"	3
A rocket plane called SpaceShipOne flew into the record books in October. It became the first private spacecraft to carry people to space. The SpaceShipOne team won a $10 million prize for making the trip twice within two weeks. The prize was designed to encourage people to build spacecraft to carry paying tourists into space. The company that owns SpaceShipOne hopes to take tourists into space as soon as 2007. Of course, tickets won't be cheap. A single ticket will cost more than $200,000!	3
"""Are we there yet?"" Have you ever asked that question on a long trip? Now imagine what a seven-year trip would be like! That is how long it took a spacecraft to reach the planet Saturn. During its trip, the spacecraft Cassini traveled very far--more than 2 billion miles! ""The trip has sort of been like a long car drive, and we can't wait to get out there and explore the sites,"" said scientist Jeremy Jones. Cassini is now orbiting Saturn. That means it is flying in a path around the planet. Cassini's cameras are taking photos of the planet. A computer sends the photos to Earth. Over the next four years, Cassini will be busy. It will study Saturn and its rings. It will also study the 33 known moons that orbit Saturn. Scientists say Saturn holds clues to how the solar system began. They say that Saturn and its moons are almost like a tiny version of our solar system. What do scientists expect to find? No one knows for sure. ""In many ways, the most exciting part of the journey is about to begin, because we don't know what lies ahead,"" said scientist Julie Webster. Earth and the other planets in our solar system travel around the sun. Saturn is the second-largest planet in the solar system. (Jupiter is the largest planet.) More than nine Earths could line up across Saturn! Do you think exploring space is important? Why?"	3
"Two girls in Sri Lanka walk past the rubble that was once their school. It was destroyed in the tsunami (soo-NAH-mee), or series of huge waves, that hit South Asia in December. Since then, temporary schools have been set up in buildings that are still standing and in tents. The girls, along with thousands of other students, can now return to school. ""The opening of these schools is a powerful sign for people that life can begin again,"" said Carol Bellamy, the director of UNICEF. That is a group that helps children in need. UNICEF and other groups have donated thousands of tents and school supplies to countries affected by the tsunami. A tsunami is usually caused by an underwater earthquake or volcanic eruption. The recent tsunami smashed against the coasts of 12 countries in South Asia and East Africa. Tens of thousands of people were killed. Millions of others were left homeless. This map shows the countries in South Asia and East Africa where the tsunami hit. They are shown in yellow. Since the disaster, the world has reached out to help people rebuild their lives. Officials predict that it could take up to 10 years to help the region recover from the tsunami. Returning to school is helping students focus on rebuilding their lives. ""When a school opens in a disaster zone, everyone feels a sense of hope,"" said Bellamy."	3
"Koko is a gorilla with a special skill. She lives at the Gorilla Foundation in California and uses American Sign Language. Sign language lets people talk without speaking aloud. It is made up of hand movements that have meanings. A few months ago, the 33-year-old gorilla used sign language to tell her teacher that she had a toothache. A team of doctors came to the rescue. The doctors removed the tooth that was causing Koko's pain and gave her a full checkup. They said that she was in good health. Over the years, this famous gorilla has learned more than 1,000 signs. Koko can also understand about 2,000 words of spoken English. ""It's not often that we get to work on a celebrity,"" said one doctor."	3
"Four astronauts recently launched a new mission. However, this mission did not take place in space. It took place 60 feet below the surface of the ocean. The astronauts spent 10 days living in a place called Aquarius. It is a research lab on the seafloor off the coast of Florida. The lab prepares astronauts for future missions to space. During their stay, the astronauts slept, cooked, and played under the surface of the sea. They also worked on research projects. The projects help scientists understand how to better travel and work in space. ""It's very similar to living in space,"" said one astronaut. ""The fact that stuff doesn't float is the only difference."""	3
"Beep! Beep! A small bus on the road is getting a lot of attention. It is a pollution-free bus that uses recycled vegetable oil as fuel. (When something is recycled, an old item is turned into something new.) The veggie bus is meant to inspire people to vote on Election Day. A group of musicians from California came up with the idea. They are driving the bus from coast to coast to spread their message. One of the musicians said, ""Our message is really simple.

Have you heard the buzz about the election for president of the United States? Election Day is almost here. The vote will take place on November 2. That is less than two months away! Two main candidates are running for president. Senator John Kerry is the Democratic candidate. President George W. Bush is the Republican candidate. On Election Day, voters will choose a winner. Until then, Bush and Kerry will keep trying to win votes. Stay tuned to learn more!	3
Aibo is a robot. It is a dog that can bark and wag its tail! Imagine it is the year 2014. After dinner, your robot clears the table and loads the dishwasher. Another robot tells jokes to make you laugh. Does that sound like a scene out of a movie? It's not! Scientists predict robots will be very common in homes across the country in the near future. Many robots are already being sold today. Sony's QRIO and iRobot's Roomba are two of these robots. QRIO is a humanlike robot that can talk, walk, jump, and dance. Roomba is a robotic vacuum cleaner. Many companies are working to create even more-advanced robots. Their goal is to make life easier for people in the future. Until then, you will just have to clean your own room!	3
Mark your calendars! January 20 is a big day for George W. Bush and the United States. It is Inauguration Day. That day is the start of a president's term in office. A term lasts for four years. This is Bush's second term in office. Inauguration Day takes place in the nation's capital, Washington, D.C. Thousands of people will gather at the U.S. Capitol building to hear the president take the Oath of Office. Millions of others will watch the ceremony on television. The Oath of Office is a promise the president makes to uphold the nation's laws and lead the country. After taking the oath, Bush will give a speech called an inaugural address. During his speech, the president will tell Americans his plans for the country's future. Weekly Reader students correctly predicted the winner of the 2004 election for president--George W. Bush. Of the 327,707 kid votes, third graders cast 57,552 ballots! The table shows how third graders voted. As you can see, Bush took a huge lead. However, the actual election results were much closer.	3
"Do you ever have trouble deciding what to wear to school? Students at Lakeside Elementary School in Ohio don't have that problem. This year, the school has a dress code. Students must wear shirts with a collar and tan, navy, or black pants. Girls can also wear jumpers or skirts. The students at Lakeside are not alone. Many students in public schools across the country are wearing uniforms for the first time. Some people think dress codes are a good idea. A lot of parents say they don't have to worry about buying designer clothing for their kids. They say that buying school uniforms is less expensive. School officials say dress codes also help students concentrate more on learning. ""[Clothes] should not be the focus,"" said one principal in Connecticut. ""Math and writing should be the focus."" Not everyone agrees that uniforms should be worn in public schools. Making students wear uniforms ""takes away some of my rights as a parent,"" said a father in Nevada. Some people say school uniforms also go against kids' freedom to express themselves. That right is promised in the U.S. Constitution. It is a document that states the laws of our country and Americans' rights. Weekly Reader spoke to some third graders at Lakeside Elementary School. We asked them: Do you like having a school uniform? ""I like the uniforms. No one judges you, because you are wearing the same thing they are."" --Brittany ""I don't like wearing the uniform, because I'm not used to it."" --Drew Should public schools have dress codes? Why? ""I like them because I don't have to pick out anything. I don't like them, because the outfits are all the same."" --Maggie"	3
"Dressed in a white costume, scientist Joe Duff pretends to be a whooping crane. He may look silly, but he has an important job to do. Duff is training a flock of whooping crane chicks in Wisconsin to think he is their mother. ""It's like becoming a bird yourself,"" he told Weekly Reader. Joe Duff is the team leader of a group called Operation Migration. Members have been teaching ""whoopers"" to migrate to Florida since 2001. When animals migrate, they move from one place to another. Operation Migration workers train the young whoopers to follow very light aircraft called ultralights. Each aircraft is flown by a pilot in a whooping crane costume. In six months, the birds will be ready to follow the aircraft and migrate to Florida for the winter. The whooping crane is an endangered bird. Only one flock of whooping cranes lives naturally in the wild. Those birds migrate between Canada and Texas. Scientists decided that having more than one flock would keep these birds from dying out. Whooping cranes trained by Operation Migration in the past have remembered the route. They return to Wisconsin each spring and fly back to Florida in the fall. ""We want our birds to pay attention to us for the first year, until we get them down to Florida,"" said Duff. ""After that, we hope they communicate with wild birds and become wild birds themselves."" In October, pilots will lead the new flock of whoopers south for the winter. The migration route will take them over seven states: Wisconsin, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Tennessee, Georgia and finally Florida. Joe Duff spends a lot of time pretending to be a whooping crane. If you could be any animal, what would you be? Why?"	3
"Penguins waddle down a snow-covered hill. They dive into the cold waters off the Antarctic Peninsula. The peninsula is on the continent of Antarctica. That area is very cold. Several million Adélie penguins once lived on the Antarctic Peninsula. By the late 1980s, their numbers decreased by half, scientist Wayne Trivelpiece told Weekly Reader. Ice in that area once formed every winter and melted away in the summer. Trivelpiece said that recently winter ice has been ""forming only once every five to six years."" Many scientists say the disappearing ice is caused by global warming. That is the slow increase in temperature around the world. Most scientists say people are partly to blame for global warming. When people drive cars and use electricity, they burn fossil fuels, such as coal, oil, and natural gas. Fossil fuels come from the remains of plants and animals that lived long ago. The burning of fossil fuels gives off gases that add to the overheating of Earth. ""Our research teaches a lesson,"" said Trivelpiece. ""Even a small change in the environment can have a big effect."" The burning of fossil fuels gives off carbon dioxide. Carbon dioxide and other gases around Earth trap heat from the sun. That can cause a rise in temperature around the world. That rise is known as global warming."	3
It's a race to the finish line! Election Day is less than six weeks away. On November 2, American voters will choose the next president of the United States. By now, you probably know the two main candidates running for president. George W. Bush is the Republican candidate. He is the current president of the United States. John Kerry is the Democratic candidate. He is a senator from Massachusetts. A candidate's teammate is called a running mate. That person will become vice president if the team wins. Richard Cheney, the current vice president, is Bush's running mate. Kerry chose John Edwards as his running mate. Edwards is a senator from North Carolina. To win votes, Bush and Kerry have been busy with their campaigns (kam-PAYNZ). A campaign is the way a candidate tries to win votes. As part of their campaigns, the candidates have been speaking about important issues. An issue is a problem our country needs to solve. Some of the issues are education, the war in Iraq, and jobs. During the next few weeks, the candidates will work hard to win votes. Experts say the 2004 election will be a close race. Americans will have to wait until Election Day to find out who crosses the finish line first. How well do you know the candidates for president? Here are some of their favorite things. Would you want to be president of the United States? Why or why not?	3
"Neil McCalmont is a whiz when it comes to trivia about presidents of the United States. The 8-year-old from New Hampshire recently created a board game. It is now being sold by a small company. The game is called ""U.S. Presidents: Not Your Typical Trivia Game."" Neil tested out his game with family and friends of all ages. It was a big hit. Neil became interested in presidents when he was in first grade. His class was learning about the presidents whose pictures appear on money. After that, the rest is history. Who is Neil's favorite president? ""It's George Washington, because without him, there wouldn't be any presidents,"" he told Weekly Reader."	3
Hispanic Americans are people whose families come from Spanish-speaking countries. People of Hispanic origin are the fastest-growing group in the United States. Today more than 290 million people live in the United States. More than 40 million of those people are Hispanic. Millions of Hispanic Americans are expected to vote for president this November. Experts say that the 2004 election will be a close race. The candidate who wins the Hispanic vote may very well win the White House.	3
"Imagine if boys made all the rules. That's how it was in 1776, when the United States was founded. Women were not allowed to vote until 1920! This year is the 85th anniversary of that important event. The women's suffrage movement began in the 1800s. Suffrage is the right to vote. To win this right, women held protests and marches. Hundreds of those women were arrested and jailed. Women's groups across the country are honoring those who fought for this right with special events throughout the year. ""Learning how women's actions changed America is important. It encourages us to understand that we can make a better world,"" said Molly Murphy MacGregor, the president of the National Women's History Project."	3
"Some people are ""howling"" over gray wolves. Officials say that the number of gray wolves is increasing in the United States. More than 150 years ago, gray wolves almost became extinct, or died out, in most of the country. Wolves were killing farm animals. People killed the wolves to protect their farm animals. In 1973, the Endangered Species Act was created. That is a law that protects endangered animals and plants. Soon after the law was made, gray wolves were added to the list of endangered species. The law helped gray wolves recover, or increase their numbers, in many states. Some of those states include Michigan, Minnesota, and Wisconsin. Government officials say that gray wolves in some states no longer need to be on the endangered species list. Leigh Haeger; Source: U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service Should gray wolves be taken off the endangered species list? Why or why not? Not all people agree with the plan to remove gray wolves from the endangered species list. They are especially worried about the recovery of gray wolves in the Northeast. ""We don't believe there are wolf packs in the Northeast,"" Peggy Struhsacker told Weekly Reader. She is a scientist who studies gray wolves. ""The Endangered Species Act must recover wolves back to their [original] range,"" she said. ""This has not been done. Right now, wolves only live in a small area of the country."""	3
"Twelve-year-old Sydney Davis knows how popular wristbands have become as a way of raising money. She thought, Why can't we have one for diabetes? Sydney Davis has had diabetes since she was 5 years old. She is one of 18 million people in the United States with this illness. In a person with diabetes, the body makes little or no insulin. Insulin helps the body use the sugar in food for energy. Sydney came up with the idea to put the slogan ""Cure Diabetes Today"" on blue wristbands. She and her friend Daniel Rosen, 13, who also has diabetes, sold the wristbands in their New Jersey community. After only a month, they had sold 10,000! Soon after, the Naomi Berrie Diabetes Center in New York began selling the wristbands on its Web site. The bands became an even bigger hit! ""We made over $100,000 already,"" Sydney told Weekly Reader. ""I didn't think we'd make this much money, so I'm very happy."" The money will pay for research to find a cure for diabetes."	3

"Americans are working hard to get the Gulf Coast back on its feet. Cleanup after Hurricane Katrina is expected to take months. In some places, it may even take years. Roads, bridges, buildings, and houses need to be repaired. Congress will spend billions of dollars to help rebuild. Other countries have donated millions. People across America are reaching out to Katrina's victims. Many people have donated money. Others have opened up their homes to families left homeless. Government officials have also been working to help provide victims with houses, jobs, and education. Many kids are going to school in new communities. ""Our hearts go out to people, our brothers and sisters, along the Gulf Coast,"" says Mayor Bill White of Houston,Texas. ""They are welcome, and we are going to provide whatever support we need to."" Hurricane Katrina hit the Gulf Coast on August 29. Winds reached more than 145 miles an hour by the time it hit land. The fierce storm destroyed buildings, homes, and trees. Officials estimated that hundreds of people died. After Katrina passed, most of New Orleans, Louisiana, was flooded. The reason is that the levees, which protect the city, collapsed. A levee is a raised area that prevents flooding. Thousands of people fled the storm. Now many want to know when they can go home—and if they still have a home. Many lost everything. ""We're dealing with one of the worst natural disasters in our nation's history,"" said President George W. Bush. ""The folks on the Gulf Coast are going to need the help of this country for a long time."" A hurricane is a strong, spinning storm that forms over oceans.

"Two whale sharks named Ralph and Norton are quickly becoming friends. They live in a huge tank at the Georgia Aquarium in Atlanta. An aquarium is a building where sea creatures are kept so the public can view them. The Georgia Aquarium opened in November and is the largest in the world. It holds 8 million gallons of water and more than 100,000 sea creatures! The whale sharks live in the largest tank at the aquarium. That is because whale sharks are the biggest fish in the world. They can grow up to 40 feet long! The aquarium also has hands-on exhibits. The exhibits give visitors achance to touch horseshoe crabs, sea stars, and stingrays. ""We want to be the worldâ€™s most engaging aquarium,"" says spokesperson Jeff Swanagan."	3
"The ice near the North Pole is thawing. That spells trouble for polar bears and other animals. The heat is on for animals living in the Arctic. That is the icy, cold region located around the North Pole. In a recent report, scientists warn that the Arctic is warming up. They say that in 2005, the Arctic had the smallest amount of ice it has had in more than 100 years. Polar bears and other animals that depend on sea ice are in danger, say scientists. Polar bears travel across the ice to hunt for seals. With less sea ice, polar bears have trouble finding food and surviving. ""If the sea ice were to disappear, animals that depend on the ice would face a greater risk of extinction,"" scientist Ted Scambos told Weekly Reader. Many scientists blame global warming for the melting Arctic ice. Global warming is the gradual rise in Earthâ€™s temperature. Some scientists say people contribute to global warming. When people drive cars and use electricity, they burn fossil fuels, such as coal, oil, and natural gas. The burning of fossil fuels gives off gases that trap heat from the sun. That can cause a rise in temperature around the world. ""Things are changing very fast near the North Pole. Eventually, that is going to affect the rest of the world as well,"" says Scambos. ""This is going to be one of the great challenges facing people in the next 50 to 100 years."" Earth is made up of many different habitats. The Arctic is a cold, windy environment called the tundra. Snow and ice cover the ground for most of the year. No trees grow there because the soil is too cold. However, some plants grow in the tundra."	3
"The future looks bright for some endangered animals! Thanks to tough laws and hardworking scientists, many of these animals are doing well. The bald eagle is one success story. The bird became the symbol of the United States in 1782. At that time, about 100,000 bald eagles lived in the lower 48 states. By 1963, only 417 nesting pairs remained. Hunting and loss of habitat contributed to the decline, or drop in number. However, the biggest threat came from DDT, a chemical used for farming. DDT made the birdsâ€™ eggshells so thin that chicks couldnâ€™t survive. In 1972, DDT was banned, or not allowed. In 1973, the Endangered Species Act was created. That law protects threatened plants and animals. Bald eagles soon gained protection under this law. Today, there are more than 7,100 bald eagle nesting pairs in the lower 48 states. Plans are under way to take the birds off the endangered species list. If that happens, they will still be protected by other U.S. laws. ""It is a good endangered species success story,"" spokesperson Nicholas Throckmorton of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service told Weekly Reader. ""Caring citizens have brought our national symbol back from the brink of extinction."" The bald eagle isnâ€™t the only endangered species doing well. Here are some other success stories. Grizzly bears in and around Yellowstone National Park were endangered as a result of hunting and habitat loss. By 1975, only 220 to 320 bears lived in Yellowstone. Today, there are more than 600. People used to hunt Hawaiian green sea turtles. Scientists counted only 67 nesting females in 1973. Now the number of nesting females has jumped to more than 400. Southern sea otters of California were once killed by pollution and fishermen. In 1938, there were only 700 otters off the coast of California. Today, there are more than 2,500."	3

"A celebration is under way for Ben Franklin's 300th birthday. Way is he considered one of the greatest Americans of all time? Put on your party hat! January 17 is the 300th anniversary of Ben Franklinâ€™s birth. People across the United States will celebrate the ways this great American helped our country. In Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, events are taking place all year. The main event is an exhibit called Benjamin Franklin: In Search of a Better World. It began in Philadelphia and will travel to four other states during the year—Missouri,Texas, Colorado, and Georgia. ""In his 300th year, we want people to understand why Ben Franklin is still so important,"" spokesperson Nicola Twilley told Weekly Reader. ""We want to bring him and his legacy to life."" A legacy is something passed on to future generations. Why is Philadelphia making such a big fuss about Franklinâ€™s birthday? In 1723,when he was 17 years old, Franklin made his home there. He worked to make life in that city better. In Philadelphia, he helped set up the countryâ€™s first hospital, public library, and volunteer fire department. During the 1700s, Philadelphia was the center of American government. When Franklin was young, America was made up of 13 colonies ruled by England. Franklin helped America gain independence. He also helped write the Declaration of Independence and the U.S. Constitution. If you could interview Ben Franklin, what would you ask him? Why?"	3
We live in a jam-packed world. In fact, more people live here than ever before. The population recently hit a whopping 6.5 billion! The big news was reported by the U.S. Census Bureau. The number of people on the planet has doubled since 1960. And that number continues to grow. As you can see from the graph, experts estimate that six years from now, Earth will be home to about 7 billion people. That is not surprising when you consider that 261 people are born each minute. A fact is a true statement. An opinion is an idea or a belief. Underline two facts and circle two opinions in this issue.	3
Knock, Knock? Who's there? The ivory-billed woodpecker, that's who! The ivory-billed woodpecker has bird lovers cheering. They thought the bird was extinct. Now scientists say they have proof that the woodpecker still lives in Arkansas. They have a videotape of the bird in flight. Why did the rare bird disappear? Between 1880 and the 1940s, loggers cut down the forests where the bird lived. The last sighting of the bird was in 1944. The ivorybill is the largest woodpecker in the United States. Its call sounds like the toot of a tin horn. The bird is also known for its unique, or one-of-a-kind, tapping sound. It makes a double knock when its beak strikes a tree. Some people didn't think the videotape was enough proof, so the scientists recorded the bird's double knock. The recording made believers out of everyone.

"Car owners in Pennsylvania recently showed their American spirit. Their cars helped form an American flag. The 140 cars were parked in rows to create the red and white stripes and blue square. To make the flag complete, people held up 50 stars. As part of the celebration, the car owners sang our national anthem. A national anthem is the official song of a country. The event was part of the National Anthem Project. The goal of the project is to teach Americans the words to the country's national anthem—""The Star-Spangled Banner."" Two out of three Americans don't know the words to the song. Francis Scott Key wrote the words to ""The Star-Spangled Banner"" as a poem in 1814.

"Live from Australia, itâ€™s the Great Barrier Reef! Scientists are using special sensors, known as digital skins, to monitor changes in this underwater treasure. The sensors are devices that record changes in the ocean and send up-to-the-minute information to computers. Until now, scientists were able to monitor changes only after they had occurred. Scientists hope the new information will help them learn how to better care for coral reefs. Coral reefs around the world are in trouble. Fishing nets and ships break off sections of the reefs and damage them. Natural disasters and pollution are also doing harm. At the same time, warmer sea temperatures cause the coral to die. Although coral may look like a plant, it is actually made up of tiny sea animals called polyps. As polyps die, they leave behind hard shells. Other polyps grow on top of the shells. Over many years, the polyps form coral reefs. Coral reefs play a very important role in ocean life. They supply food and shelter to thousands of different types of ocean creatures living in and around the reefs. People also depend on coral reefs for jobs, food, and medicine to treat diseases. ""Coral reefs are incredibly threatened,"" Rick MacPherson of Californiaâ€™s Coral Reef Alliance told Weekly Reader. ""They require, now more than ever, that people pay attention and work toward protecting them."" The Great Barrier Reef is the largest coral reef in the world. It stretches 1,250 miles along the northeast coast of Australia."	3
"The 2006 Olympic Winter Games are almost here! Who will bring home the gold? Olympic spirit is in the air! From February 10 to 26, athletes from around the world will compete at the 2006 Olympic Winter Games. Like the Summer Games, the Winter Games take place every four years. This year, they will be held in Turin, or Torino, Italy. The first Winter Games were held in 1924. That year, athletes competed for medals in five sports. Over the years, more sports were added. This yearâ€™s games will include 15 sports. Some of the most popular are figure skating, snowboarding, skiing, and ice hockey. Making it to the Winter Olympics has been Hannah Teterâ€™s goal. The 19-year-old from Vermont began snowboarding at the age of 8. She is considered one of the best female snowboarders in the world. Snowboarding is one of the newest sports at the Winter Games. It was added in 1998. Snowboarding is similar to skateboarding or surfing—but itâ€™s done on snow. Riders slide down a steep slope on a snowboard and perform tricks in the air. Teter isnâ€™t the only U.S. athlete dreaming of Olympic gold. Some other U.S. athletes with their eyes on the prize are speed skater Apolo Anton Ohno, alpine skier Bode Miller, and figure skater Michelle Kwan. They are among the 2,500 athletes representing 85 countries. The people in Turin are busy preparing for the arrival of the athletes. The city is also getting ready for more than a million spectators, or audience members. ""The opening ceremony for Torino 2006 is now only a moment away,"" says Olympic official Jean-Claude Killy. ""With the winter sports season well under way, all eyes are turning to Torino and to Italy."" Athletes are often thought of as heroes. What makes a hero?"	3
Is it possible to see a dinosaur in action? With the help of computers, scientists are able to do just that. Their discoveries are now on exhibit at the American Museum of Natural History in New York City. Dinosaur fossils are easier to study than ever before. Fossils are the remains of plants and animals from long ago. Scientists study how fossil bones fit together to figure out how dinosaurs moved. Those details are entered into a computer program. It creates a model of a dinosaur. With a touch of the screen, scientists can make the dinosaur move. That helps scientists learn more about dinosaurs. For example, scientists once thought Apatosaurus held its long neck high in the air. A computer model revealed that it most likely kept its neck bent down to eat low plants.	3
Hip, hip, hooray! Repetition of a beginning letter sound is called alliteration. Find an example on this page. Then try writing a few of your own. Would you give up meat and eat only veggies? Millions of years ago, a group of dinosaurs may have made that switch. Scientists recently dug up fossils of hundreds of dinosaurs in Utah. Fossils are the remains of plants and animals that lived long ago. The kind of dinosaur found in Utah was a mix between a carnivore and a herbivore. A carnivore is a meat eater. A herbivore is a plant eater. Like other carnivores, this dinosaur had sharp claws and could move fast. At the same time, it had teeth shaped for eating leaves, and a long neck to reach tall trees. The fossils are an important discovery, say scientists. They hope it will help them understand how the dinosaurs changed from a diet of meat to one of plants.	3
"Mexico's ""Volcano of Fire"" roars back to life. When will the next big explosion occur? The Colima (koh-LEE-mah) Volcano in Mexico has roared to life again. The 12,500-foot volcano is also called the ""Volcano of Fire."" Over the past few months, its eruptions have been larger and more frequent. It has been shooting hot gas and ash high into the sky. The Volcano of Fire is Mexico's most active volcano. It has erupted many times over the years. What scientists are most worried about is the next big eruption. The volcano has had huge eruptions about every hundred years. The last one took place in 1913. Scientists have noticed a pattern in recent activity that is very much like the pattern before the 1913 eruption. ""Most scientists are expecting a large, explosive eruption in the next 10 years or so,"" volcano expert Jim Luhr told Weekly Reader. The volcano is 20 miles north of the city of Colima. To make sure no one is in danger, officials created a safety zone around the volcano. People aren't allowed in that area. Scientists use special equipment to track changes within the volcano. ""We're looking for clues of another large, explosive eruption,"" says Luhr. ""That way, we can be prepared."" A volcano is a mountain with an opening on top called a vent. Volcanoes can be active, dormant (not active now but may erupt someday), or extinct. When a volcano is active, magma collects in chambers beneath Earth's surface. Magma is hot, melted rock. After pressure from gases in the magma builds up, the volcano erupts. Magma explodes from vents on top and along its sides. Magma that has less gas oozes from the volcano as lava. What other natural disasters might scientists try to predict? Why?"	3
"Fans of fairy tales have much to celebrate this year. It is the 200th anniversary of author Hans Christian Andersen's birth. Andersen wrote more than 150 stories. Some of his tales are ""The Little Mermaid,"" ""The Emperor's New Clothes,"" and ""The Ugly Duckling."" Events to honor the writer have taken place all over the world. The events included puppet shows and festivals. People also sang songs and played music. ""They are funny and sad and joyous. I never get tired of them."" All news stories answer these questions: Who? What? Where? When? Why? How? Underline the answers to those questions in one of the stories in this issue."	3
"An alarm sounds at the base. Smoke jumpers quickly grab their gear. Minutes later they are getting ready to jump out of an airplane. Their parachutes open, and they land near a blazing wildfire. Smoke jumpers are firefighters with special training. They jump from planes into wildfire areas that are remote, or hard to reach. The smoke jumpers carry enough food and water with them to survive for several days. During the last few months, smoke jumpers have been busy. It is wildfire season in the western United States. The season began in June and usually lasts until November. Many wildfires start naturally—either by lightning or by the sun's heat. Other fires are caused by people. ""This year is unique,"" wildfire official Rose Davis told Weekly Reader. In the Southwest, heavy rain in the early part of the year caused a lot of new grass to grow. The summer was hot and dry. New grass burns quickly when it dries out. The Northwest is in a drought. A drought is a long period of dry weather, with little or no rain. Dry grass and trees catch fire easily. ""A wildfire can spread from 5 acres to 500 acres within an hour or two,"" smoke jumper Lori Messenger told Weekly Reader. ""We can get to small, remote fires very fast and put them out while they are still small."""	3
"Until recently, the orange was not the official state fruit of Florida. ""Orange"" you surprised? Now, thanks to a group of students, it is the state fruit. The kids came up with the idea last year, when they were in fourth grade. They attend Southside Elementary School in Sarasota, Florida. ""We were completely surprised that the orange wasn't the state fruit of Florida,"" their teacher, Janet Shapiro, told Weekly Reader. After all, orange juice is the state drink. The orange blossom is the state flower. A picture of oranges is even on the state's license plate. The kids sent letters to local lawmakers asking them to make the orange official. In May, Florida's governor, Jeb Bush, came to their school. There, he signed the orange bill into law. ""We made history,"" says Kia Gentile, 11. ""It was awesome!"""	3
The GalÃ¡pagos Islands are home to wildlife found nowhere else on Earth. The islandsâ€™ famous giant tortoises and other rare animals roam free. People were worried about those animals after a volcano on the largest island began erupting. Lava poured slowly out of the volcano and headed down its slopes. Lava is red-hot, liquid rock that comes out of a volcano. Officials say the islandsâ€™ animals were safe from harm. They were not in the path of the lava flow. The GalÃ¡pagos Islands are in the Pacific Ocean. They are located off the coast of Ecuador, a country in South America.	3
"Yuck! A health and safety group recently tested school surfaces for germs and found millions! Drinking fountains had the most germs. A cafeteria tray had more germs than a toilet seat! The testers also found germs lurking on desks and computer keyboards. Kids miss 22 million days of school each year because of colds caught from germs. That number would be much lower if kids would just wash their hands, say health experts. Not all germs are harmful, but some can make kids sick. ""When you share things in a classroom, you increase the chance that you might get sick,"" the health and safety groupâ€™s spokesperson, Jerry Bowman, told Weekly Reader. ""Since we are right in the middle of cold and flu season, we have to be extra careful to wash our hands and cover up [our] coughs."""	3
"Each sentenceâ€™s subject(who or what the sentence is about) must agree in number with its verb. Circle five verbs on this page and underline their subjects. For example, seals live at the Arctic. Scientists have discovered fossils of an ancient sea crocodile with a head like a dinosaurâ€™s. It most likely lived in the Pacific Ocean about 135 million years ago, during the Age of the Dinosaurs. The ancient crocodile was a top ocean predator. A predator is an animal that feeds on other animals. The creature was 13 feet long and had 4-inch teeth! Scientists nicknamed the creature ""Godzilla,"" after the film monster. Fossils of the creature were found in 1996 in Argentina. That is a country in South America. Scientists spent years studying the fossils before reporting their giant find."	3

Danny Way, 31, jumped into the record books this summer. He became the first person to leap over the Great Wall of China on a skateboard. Parts of the Great Wall of China are more than 2,000 years old. The wall is the largest structure ever built. Experts say it is about 4,000 miles long. Way made the jump using a ramp that he helped build near his home in California. The ramp helped him speed over the wall at nearly 50 miles an hour. That is almost as fast as a car travels on the highway! A compound word is made up of two words. For example, something is a compound word made up of some and thing.

"The worldâ€™s great apes are in danger. Many countries are working together to help them. Can these animals be saved in time? Time is running out for the great apes. If no action is taken, they may soon be extinct, say experts. The great apes include gorillas, chimpanzees, orangutans, and bonobos. Orangutans live in Indonesia, a country in Asia. The other great apes live in Africa. More than 20 countries, mostly in Africa, recently signed a pledge to save the great apes. A pledge is a promise. At one time, millions of these animals lived in the wild. As few as 350,000 of them exist today. Saving the great apes from dying out is no easy task. The animals face many threats—most of them from humans. One of the biggest threats is the loss of habitat. Some people illegally cut down trees in the areas where great apes live. Another threat to great apes is illegal hunting. People have eaten meat from wild animals for thousands of years. ""We have not treated [the great apes] with the respect they deserve,"" says Kofi Annan. He is the secretary-general of the United Nations. That is a group of countries that work together to solve world problems. Although saving the great apes will not be easy, experts think the pledge is a step in the right direction. ""The great apes still have a chance,"" says Annan, ""but their fate lies entirely in our hands."" The gorilla is the largest great ape. It can grow to 6 feet tall and weigh up to 400 pounds! The chimpanzee uses many objects as tools. For example, it often uses sticks to fish for termites. The smallest great ape is the bonobo. It grows up to 3 feet tall and weighs about 75 to 100 pounds. The orangutan lives in the treetops of tropical rain forests. It is the largest tree-dwelling animal."	3
"Artist Cynthia Vose believes that hats tell a story. Women have worn different hats throughout history. In honor of Womenâ€™s History Month, Vose organized an art exhibit about hats. The exhibit is taking place this month at a library in Billerica, Massachusetts. ""Hats serve a purpose,"" Vose told Weekly Reader. ""Beyond fashion, hats represent the changing roles of women in society."" In the 1800s, many American women wore bonnets. As women gained rights, they no longer wore hats just for fashion. Women began to wear hats for jobs that were once held by men."	3
"Ouch! Portable music players may hurt your ears, say health experts. Many kids love their iPods. Courtney Burnham from Connecticut is one of those kids. She listens to music on long car rides, while walking to school, and on weekends. ""I wish I could listen to it during school,"" the fourth grader told Weekly Reader. Listening to portable music players is fun, but it may not be safe. Health experts warn that it may lead to hearing loss— especially if you listen to loud music for hours on end. Why? Portable music players send loud sounds straight into the ears. That can damage tiny hairs inside the ear that help you hear. Listening to loud noise for long periods of time can also lead to a ringing in the ears called tinnitus (TIH-nih-tuss). The ringing often goes away in a few days. However, in some cases it never stops. It becomes a permanent problem. Not just portable music players are to blame for hearing problems. Anything from rock concerts to loud power tools can damage your ears. More than 5 million kids have some hearing loss from loud noises. And that number may continue to rise. How do you know whether the music you are listening to is too loud? If you canâ€™t hear someone talking to you from a few feet away, itâ€™s TOO LOUD! You can also ask a friend. If your friend can hear the music from your earpiece, you should turn it down, say experts. Your ears will thank you later. 1. Sound enters through the outer ear. 2. Sound goes through the ear canal. 3. Sound hits the eardrum and makes it move back and forth. 4. Three tiny bones called the hammer, anvil, and stirrup also move. 5. The cochlea (KOHK-lee-uh), lined with tiny hairs, sends messages to the auditory nerve. 6. The auditory nerve sends messages to the brain. The brain figures out what was heard."	3
"Thanksgiving is a time when many families enjoy a special meal together. But experts say that before you dig in, make sure you eat safely. Gobbling up food too quickly is one of the main causes of choking. A person who is choking can't speak or breathe. The Heimlich (HIGHM-lik) maneuver is a special move that can help save the life of a person who is choking. When Eric Wilson was in the third grade, he read about the maneuver in Weekly Reader. He put what he learned to good use. Eric saved the life of first grader Bryce Bloomfield. Bryce was choking on candy. ""His face started to turn red,"" Eric, who is now in fourth grade, told Weekly Reader. ""I had to do the Heimlich maneuver a couple of times. I saw the candy come out of his mouth. I felt glad because I saved another kid's life."" 1. Stand behind the choking person and wrap your arm around his or her waist. 2. Make a fist and hold it against the person's stomach, about halfway between the belly button and the rib cage. 3. Grab your fist with your other hand. Press it in with an upward thrust. Repeat until the person stops choking."	3
The face of the United States is changing. Hispanic Americans, also known as Latinos, make up the fastest-growing group. The latest U.S. census update shows that 41 million people are Hispanic. A census is a count of people. Hispanic Americans are people whose families are from Spanish-speaking countries. Most of those countries are in Central and South America. Nearly 297 million people live in the United States today. One of every seven people in our country is Hispanic! The news comes just in time for Hispanic Heritage Month. It takes place each year from September 15 to October 15. During this time, Americans honor Hispanic history and customs. Many families celebrate by taking part in festivals and parades.	3

Hundreds of jumbo jellyfish are invading the Sea of Japan. Each creature weighs about 450 pounds and is 6 feet wide! Scientists arenâ€™t quite sure what has caused the jellyfish boom, but it is a huge problem. It is affecting the fishing industry in Japan, China, and South Korea. The jellyfish break fishing nets. They also poison fish caught in the nets. The three countries recently held a meeting to find ways of dealing with the problem. In the meantime, some people are making the best of it by eating the giant jellyfish! In parts of China, they are a prized food.

"You turn on the TV and see your favorite cartoon character. But wait a minute—thatâ€™s not a show; it is a commercial for junk food! Cartoon characters are being used to sell junk foods on TV. How does that affect you? Thatâ€™s wrong, says the Institute of Medicine, which advises the nation on health issues. The group says that kid-friendly characters should promote only foods that are good for you. The group recently reported that food ads on TV have astrong influence on what kids under the age of 12 eat. ""Our eating habits and preferences form early in our lives,"" the groupâ€™s spokesperson, Christine Stencel, told Weekly Reader. ""Advertising influences these preferences."" Advertisers know kids have spending power. ""American kids spend about $200 billion each year. Foods high in sugar and fat are among the top 10 items,"" says Stencel. ""Kids also influence what their parents buy."" A calorie is a measure of the amount of energy a food can provide. The body needs food as fuel. However, people gain weight when they take in more calories than they use up through activity. Millions of people in the United States are obese, or severely overweight. Being overweight can lead to serious health problems. ""The committee thinks it is time people should take steps to reduce the problem of obesity,"" says Stencel. ""That includes making changes in what foods are marketed to kids and how they are promoted."" Foods that are high in nutrition help people stay healthy. Good choices:"	3
"Imagine being in charge of a country at the age of 8 or 9! That is what life was like for King Tutankhamun (too-tahn-KAH-men). He became king of Egypt 3,300 years ago, after his father died. King Tut ruled for 10 years. He died when he was about 18 years old. King Tut's tomb was discovered near the Nile River in 1922. A tomb is a burial place. Inside the tomb were gold, jewelry, and other treasures. Fifty of those artifacts are now on a tour in the United States. An artifact is an object made by people long ago. The exhibit is called ""Tutankhamun and the Golden Age of the Pharaohs."" Pharaoh is another name for an Egyptian ruler. The exhibit is touring the United States. It is now open at a museum in Los Angeles, California. Now open in Los Angeles, Tut's exhibit will make stops in three other U.S. cities. It will return to Eygpt in 2007. This isn't the first time Tut's treasures have visited the United States. Some of those artifacts came here in the 1970s. ""The first exhibit was about the discovery of the tomb and the treasures it held,"" history expert David Silverman told Weekly Reader. ""This exhibit is about the life of the young king—his family, his history, and his responsibilities."" Eight million people saw the first King Tut exhibit. Now millions more will have the chance to learn about the famous boy-king by visiting the new exhibit. Would you want to rule a country at your age? Why or why not?"	3

Great geysers of water! Thatâ€™s what scientists recently discovered on Enceladus (en-SEL-ahduhss), one of Saturnâ€™s moons. A geyser is a spring that shoots water into the air. Scientists are excited by the news. Water is a key ingredient for life. Life may exist in water beneath the icy surface of Enceladus, say scientists. However, donâ€™t expect to hear about the discovery of little green aliens. The forms of life most likely to be found are microbes. A microbe is a simple life-form that can be seen only under a microscope. The findings are based on images from the spacecraft Cassini, which has been studying Saturn and its moons since 2004. The images show geysers shooting water hundreds of miles above the surface of Enceladus. For now, scientists will have to be patient. Cassini wonâ€™t get another close-up view of Enceladus until 2008.	3
"A spacecraft speeds toward the Red Planet. Scientists hope the trip will lead to answers. In many books and movies, little green aliens from Mars invade Earth. In real life, Mars is the planet being invaded—by strange-looking machines from Earth. In August, NASA, the U.S. space agency, launched a spacecraft to Mars. It is called an orbiter because it will orbit, or circle, the fourth planet from the sun. Right now, the orbiter is speeding toward Mars. Scientists expect it to reach the Red Planet in March. The orbiter will join two robots, called rovers, that are already there. They have been rolling around on the surface of the planet for more than two years. They are searching for signs of water. Mars is cold and dry. Scientists think the planet was once a warmer and wetter place. Evidence of water can mean that life once existed on Mars. The orbiter will look for signs of water. It is expected to spend at least two years studying Mars. It will scan Mars with the largest telescope camera ever sent to a planet. The orbiter's radar will look for water beneath the planet's surface. It will also search for landing spots to prepare for future human missions to Mars. ""This orbiter is going to look much farther and with more detail than what the rovers could do,"" NASA's Ramon DePaula told Weekly Reader. ""We are going to bring back more data than all other missions to Mars combined."""	3
"One lobster has been getting a lot of attention lately. Although most lobsters are a brownish red, this one is showing off its unusual color—bright blue! Blue lobsters are very rare. Only about one in 3 million lobsters is blue! A fisherman caught the blue creature two years ago and donated it to a nature center in Bristol, Rhode Island. Lobsters are crustaceans (kruss-TAY-shunz). A crustacean is an animal with a hard shell. Lobsters, like all crustaceans, grow by molting. When a lobster molts, it loses its old shell and grows a new one. The ""new shell is always a brighter color,"" nature center staff member Anne DiMonti told Weekly Reader. Lobsters keep growing throughout their lives. They can live to be 100 years old. Lobsters molt about 25 times in the first five to seven years of life. After that, they molt just once a year."	3

"Many people have heard the loud trumpet sounds that elephants make. But did you know that elephants make a lot of other noises that humans can't hear? Scientists have recently learned that each elephant has a unique voice. Unique means ""one of a kind."" Scientist Anne Savage told Weekly Reader, ""Each person's voice is different. It's the same for elephants."" The scientists listened to the secret language of African elephants at Disney's Animal Kingdom in Florida. To hear the elephants, they used special equipment. Each elephant wore a radio collar fitted with a microphone. Then the sound was recorded and studied using a computer. African elephants are endangered, or at risk of dying out. In the past, people have hunted the elephants for their ivory tusks. Today that practice is not allowed in most African countries. However, some people ignore the laws and still hunt elephants. The huge animals are also endangered because people build homes and farms in areas where elephants live. African elephants are the largest living land animals. The average male weighs more than four cars! An African elephant never sweats. Heat escapes through its large ears to keep the animal cool. African elephants like to take baths every day. Then, they cover themselves in dirt to keep insects away. The work scientists are doing at Animal Kingdom may help African elephants in the wild. ""If we can tell individual voices apart, we can keep track of each elephant over time,"" says Savage. ""We can tell when elephants are feeling nervous by the voices they are using. In the wild, that would help us know if they are in danger, so we can help them."" Why might African elephants need to talk with each other? What might they say?"	3
With a wave of his wand, Harry Potter has put kids under his spell. Now more kids than ever are going wild for fantasy. Muggles, look out! The magic of Harry Potter is taking over. Kids are heading to the world of fantasy. Fantasy is a genre (ZHAN-ruh), or type, of fiction. It is set in a world different from our own. The stories involve magic and imaginary creatures. Fantasy is nothing new. But it has become all the rage again, thanks to author J. K. Rowling. This summer, millions of Harry Potter fans lined up for the sixth book in the series. Kids are also going wild for other fantasy books. These books include Eragon, by Christopher Paolini, and A Series of Unfortunate Events, by Lemony Snicket. The fantasy craze has also hit the big screen. Many books are being turned into movies. One of the most popular is The Lord of the Rings. This December, The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe will leap from page to screen. The book, by C. S. Lewis, tells the story of four kids who enter a magical world called Narnia. On November 18, fans will be able to see the fourth Harry Potter book come alive. Will the movie be a success? Daniel Radcliffe, 15, plays the boy wizard on screen. Weekly Reader caught up with him on the set of Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire. If you could have one magical power, what would it be? Why?	3

"On January 16, Americans will honor a great leader—Martin Luther King Jr. (1929-1968). This year is the 20th anniversary of the King holiday. As a leader, King took action to improve his community. When he was growing up in the South, black people did not have the same rights as white people. When King was older, he gave speeches and led peaceful marches. As a result of his work, lawmakers passed civil rights laws. Those laws protect the rights of all Americans. King encouraged others to work together to make the world a better place. He once said, ""Everybody can be great because everybody can serve."" By taking part in community service projects, Americans keep Kingâ€™s dream alive."	3
"The koala is a picky eater. To choose what to eat, it just follows its nose. The menu for koalas is always the same—leaves! They eat only the leaves of eucalyptus (yoo-kuh-LIP-tuhs) trees. Sound boring? Not to a koala! There are thousands of these trees in Australia. The only problem is that leaves from some trees can make koalas very sick. How does a koala know which leaves to choose? Scientists recently discovered that koalas learn from experience. After eating leaves that make them sick, the animals use their sense of smell to remember to avoid that type of leaf. Scientists were not surprised to learn that koalas prefer large trees to small ones. Prefer means ""to like better."" Large trees have more leaves and offer better shelter to koalas. However, no matter how large the tree, koalas will not eat from one that makes them sick. They would rather go hungry than eat leaves from these trees, say scientists. To a koala, a forest is a tricky mix of good and bad leaves. Scientist Ben Moore says, ""It's like having to choose between 1,000 restaurants—or trees, in the koala's case—spread all over town, without a restaurant guide."" Koalas use their sense of smell to choose leaves. How does your sense of smell help you?"	3
"What animal honks like a goose and barks like a dog—at the same time? It's a monkey called the highland mangabey! Scientists recently discovered this new species, or kind, of monkey in Tanzania. That is a country in eastern Africa. Along with the monkey's unusual ""honkbark"" call, it has an odd look. The hair on the top of its head is spiked. Highland mangabeys are hard to spot. Scientists believe that fewer than 1,000 of the monkeys exist. They are very shy and live in the forest canopy. The canopy is made up of the tops of the tallest trees. Scientists were surprised when they found a new species in Tanzania. The highland mangabey is the first new species of monkey found in Africa in more than 20 years! Scientists say the discovery shows that there is still a lot to learn about Africa."	3
The new $10 bill has many changes from the old design. One thing that stayed the same is the portrait of Alexander Hamilton, the first secretary of the treasury. The $10 bill is getting a new look! The U.S. government will begin to circulate the bill early in 2006. Some of the changes include more colors and symbols of freedom. The reason for the changes is to outsmart counterfeiters (KOWNT-er-fih-terz). Those are people who try to make fake bills that look like the real ones. Counterfeiting is against the law. The $10 bill is the latest U.S. bill to get a new design. The $50 bill was updated last year, and the $20 bill got a new look in 2003. As of now, there are no plans to change the $1 or $5 bills.

"Football fans cheer as a student rides a horse down the field. The student is dressed as Chief Osceola, a famous leader of the Seminole tribe. In one hand, the student holds a flaming spear. As he throws it into the ground, the crowd goes wild. That tradition takes place before every football game at Florida State University (FSU). The NCAA recently tried to end the tradition. The NCAA is the group that oversees college sports. It made a rule that sports teams can't use Native American names or mascots after the regular season. A mascot is a symbol that represents a sports team. Some members of the Seminole tribe think the rule is unfair. They believe that FSU honors their traditions. Tribe members designed the mascot's costume, they say. They add that the student chosen as the mascot has to study the tribe's culture to earn that honor. The NCAA decided to let FSU keep its tradition. However, the rule remains for at least 17 other schools. Native Americans are the people who first settled in North and South America. Native Americans are not one group of people. There are more than 562 Native American tribes in the United States today. Each tribe has its own history and culture. Other Native Americans say that teams that use Native American mascots do not honor their culture. They think using those mascots supports stereotypes. A stereotype is an idea that a group of people is alike in a certain way. It may be untrue or only partly true. ""It is not respectful to parade around in war paint and feathers,"" John Sanchez told Weekly Reader. Sanchez is a member of the Yaqui/Apache tribe. ""This is not honoring; it is making fun of."" Do you think Native American team names and mascots should be allowed? Why or why not?"	3
Do you recognize the famous monument above? Itâ€™s the Eiffel Tower in Paris, France. The Eiffel Tower is one of 21 choices for the New 7 Wonders of the World vote. World traveler Bernard Weber started the project in 2000. He wanted to update the list of Seven Wonders of the Ancient World. Those structures were built between 4,500 and 2,200 years ago. Only one of the ancient wonders—the Pyramids in Egypt at Giza—is still standing. People around the world will cast their votes by telephone. The calls are not free, but half of the profits will go to good use. They will help restore, or repair, monuments around the world. The winners of the vote will be announced on January 1, 2007.

April marks the start of tornado season in the United States. A tornado is a powerful, spinning wind. It travels quickly and can destroy everything in its path. Tornado season, which lasts for several months, is the time these twisters are most common. The National Weather Service recently said it will change the tornado rating system next year. The strength of a tornado will continue to be rated on a scale from 0 (weakest) to 5 (most powerful). However, the new rating system will be more exact. Under the old system, tornadoes with wind speed of about 300 miles per hour were given the rating 5. Studies have shown that slower winds can cause as much damage. The new system rates a tornado 5 if wind speed is at least 200 miles per hour. Adverbs are words that describe verbs, adjectives, and other adverbs. They tell where, how, or when. Examples are here, slowly, and lately. Circle two adverbs in the tornado story.	3
George Washington/painted by Gilbert Stuart; engraved by H.S. Sadd Did you know that George Washington wore false teeth? People once thought they were made of wood. Early last year, scientists discovered that the rumor was false!His teeth were actually made of gold, ivory, lead, and animal teeth. The discovery is helping historians show the true Washington. In many portraits, the first U.S. president is shown as a serious old man. Historians are now building three life-size models to show the more exciting side ofWashington. They are based on real items from his life, including his teeth. The figures will show Washington in three stages of his life—at the ages of 19, 45, and 57. The figures will be on display in October at a new museum at Mount Vernon. Mount Vernon was Washingtonâ€™s Virginia home. A proper noun is the name of a specific person, animal, place, or thing.

A spacecraft named New Horizons recently blasted off from Florida. The craft is speeding toward Pluto, our solar systemâ€™s farthest planet from the sun. The trip is a long one—about 3 billion miles in nine and a half years. If all goes well, New Horizons will fly by Pluto in 2015 to take photos and study the icy planet. All the information it gathers will be beamed to Earth. Pluto is the only planet in our solar system that has not been explored by a spacecraft. Scientists hope the mission will help them learn more about the planet. They think it holds clues about how our solar system was formed. A possessive noun tells who or what owns something. To make most singular nouns possessive, add â€™s. Example: Australiaâ€™s Great Barrier Reef. Find two possessive nouns on this page.	3
"Utah has a state bird, a state fish, and a state insect. Thanks to a group of fourth graders, Utah may soon have a state reptile—the western rattlesnake. The students, who go to Diamond Valley Elementary School in St. George, learned a lesson in how a bill becomes a law. In February, they visited Utahâ€™s House of Representatives in Salt Lake City. They sang their school song, which mentions the snake. They also gave Governor Jon Huntsman Jr. a cherry pie (the cherry is the state fruit) and performed a square dance (the state folk dance). ""It was so cool,"" Hadli Gledhill, 9, told Weekly Reader. The studentsâ€™ efforts are paying off. The bill passed the state House of Representatives. Now it has to make it through the state Senate before it lands on the governorâ€™s desk. Huntsman told students that if the bill passes, he would like to sign the new law at their school."	3
"For years, Rosa Parks stood up to unfair laws against black people. Then on December 1, 1955, she changed the history of the United States forever. Rosa Parks was riding a city bus in Montgomery, Alabama, and was told to give up her seat to a white passenger. When she refused, she was arrested and taken to jail. At that time, states in the South were segregated by law. The law kept black people from having the same rights as white people. Black people were forced to sit in the back of city buses. They were not allowed to go to the same schools as white people. They were also forced to use separate restrooms, water fountains, and other public facilities. After Parks was arrested, thousands of people refused to ride the city buses in Montgomery. The boycott was led by Martin Luther King Jr. and lasted for more than a year. It was a success. In 1956, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the bus segregation law was illegal. December 1 marks the 50th anniversary of Rosa Parks's arrest for not giving up her seat. On that day, people across the United States will honor this important time in history. Special events will take place in Montgomery, where the equal rights movement began. As part of the day's events, hundreds of kids will march to remember the bus boycott. ""Never again should we foster hate or distrust based on one's skin color,"" says event spokesperson Kenneth Mullinax. The children will march ""as a pledge to treat everyone with equal love,"" he told Weekly Reader. Today, people can step aboard the bus that Rosa Parks made famous. It is on display at the Henry Ford Museum in Michigan. The bus has been restored to look as it did in 1955."	3
Mount Rushmore is huge. Each president's head is as tall as a six-story building! The faces of Mount Rushmore are bright and shiny now. They were washed this summer for the first time in 65 years! Mount Rushmore is a national memorial in South Dakota. It is a rock carving of the faces of four American presidents—George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, Theodore Roosevelt, and Abraham Lincoln. Cleaning the huge carving was no easy task. For weeks, workers climbed over eyeballs and under nostrils. They sprayed the rock with hot water. The cleaning removed years of dirt. However, the main goal of the job was to remove lichens (LIGH-kenz). A lichen is a plant that grows on rocks and trees. The lichen roots dig into the rock and can cause cracks. The work was a success, say officials. They believe the carving will be around for a very long time. And thanks to workers, it is also squeaky-clean.	3
One kissed a yak. One jumped from a plane. One ate fried worms. Do you think thatâ€™s insane? Possibly, but it was all for a need. School principals were challenging students to read! Those crazy stunts by school principals were all for Read Across America Day. The celebration takes place each year on March 2. That date is the birthday of childrenâ€™s book author Dr. Seuss (1904â€“1991). Millions of kids have learned to read through his silly and clever rhymes. On March 2, kids and adults across the country will take part in reading activities. Some will wear red-and-white striped top hats. And yes, some daring principals may even kiss a yak.	3
A great white shark named Nicole has taken a bite out of the record books. She swam farther than any other known shark—more than 12,400 miles! Great whites are endangered. They are often hunted for their teeth and fins. The great white shark swam from South Africa to Australia and back within nine months. That is also the fastest migration of any ocean animal. When an animal migrates, it moves from one region to another. Nicole was one of 25 great whites that scientists tagged in 2003. The tags record information such as time and speed. Scientists are using what they learn to find ways to protect these endangered animals. Pronouns are words used in place of nouns. Some examples of pronouns are they, he, it, me, and them.

"For many, Venice is the jewel of Italy. It is famous for its beautiful buildings, art, and canals. The canals, or waterways, take the place of roads. People travel through the city on boats. But this city, which attracts millions of tourists each year, is in danger of sinking. Venice is located on the Adriatic Sea. The city was built on a series of small islands in a lagoon. A lagoon is an area of shallow water. During some high tides, water floods the city. For hundreds of years, people have tried to keep water out of the city. Now a group of scientists has introduced a bold plan to prevent the city from flooding. And it means adding more water! Scientists say Venice is sinking about 1 1/2 inches each year. To save the city, scientists want to pump water into the ground through pipes. The team expects the water to expand the sand under Venice and raise the city. Scientists behind the plan say the pipes will work. However, other scientists are not as convinced. They warn that the plan could cause parts of the city to crumble if the work isnâ€™t done carefully. Everyone, however, agrees that saving the city is important. ""If we let Venice fall into the sea, the world would lose a tremendous part of [history],"" says Melissa Conn of Save Venice, a group that is working to save the city."	3

"Kids who tease and threaten others are bullies. Now there are new laws to stop them. Drew Landry, 12, from Maine knows what it's like to be bullied. Last year, when Drew was in sixth grade, he was bullied by an eighth grader. ""It was hard to get through,"" Drew told Weekly Reader. With the help of his parents and school officials, the bullying has stopped. Drew is not alone. Many kids are victims of bullying. That is why states across the country have enacted anti-bullying laws. Enact means ""to sign into law."" Some schools already have rules to stop bullying. However, many lawmakers felt those rules were not tough enough. Maine is now the 18th state to enact such a law. The law requires schools to create a plan to prevent and deal with bullying. All adults who work with students must be trained to handle bullying problems. If you are being bullied, you can do something about it! Here are three tips from the National Center for School Safety. No! If you are being bullied, tell the bully in a firm voice that you do not like what he or she is doing. Go! Walk away quickly. Tell! Find an adult right away, and tell the adult what happened. A bully picks on another person again and again. Many kids think of bullying as hitting or pushing, but it is more than that. It often takes the form of name-calling, teasing, and threatening. Drew wants to make sure no other kids are bullied. He spoke in front of lawmakers to support Maine's new law. ""I helped change the law to help other kids feel better about themselves,"" says Drew. ""The new law also makes me feel safer."" Why might someone try to bully another person? What would you do if a friend was being bullied?"	3
"What tiny animals can be seen partying in the movie Madagascar? Lemurs! In the wild, lemurs are found only in Madagascar. That is an island off the coast of Africa. It is home to many animals that live nowhere else on Earth. Recently, scientists found two new species, or types, of lemurs. Finding a new species is rare. Many species of lemurs have become extinct. That means they have died out completely. One of the newly discovered animals is a tiny, wide-eyed mouse lemur. It is full of energy and bounces around. The other species is a giant mouse lemur with a bushy tail. Scientists named the animal Mirza zaza. The word zaza means ""child"" in Malagasy. That's the language of the people of Madagascar. The name was chosen to remind the kids of Madagascar to protect the island's rare animals."	3
"The family tree of the fearsome Tyrannosaurus rex just got bigger. Scientists recently dug up two dinosaur skeletons in China that are believed to be its oldest relatives. The newly discovered dinosaurs lived 160 million years ago—about 90 million years before T. rex came along. The scientists named the species Guanlong wucaii. The name is Mandarin (Chinese). Guanlong means ""crowned dragon"" and refers to the crest, or crown, on the dinosaurâ€™s head. The second word, wucaii, describes the area where the fossils were found. Like T. rex, Guanlong was a meat eater that walked on two legs. But Guanlong was tiny—only 10 feet long—compared with the 40-foot-long T. rex. ""We knew we had something [important],"" James M. Clark, a team leader for the dig, told Weekly Reader. The discovery will help scientists learn more about the T. rex family."	3

"Can the endangered Bengal tiger be saved? Wildlife officials in India, a country in Asia, certainly hope so. They recently began counting Bengal tigers to see how many are left. The census, or official count, is part of a plan to save the animal from becoming extinct, or dying out. People are the major threat to the tigers. With new roads, homes, and farms being built, the tigersâ€™ habitat is being destroyed. Illegal hunting is also a problem. There is a high demand for tiger body parts in Asia. Clothes and rugs are made from the tigerâ€™s coat. In China, some people use tiger bones and other parts to make medicine. Can the tigers be saved? ""Yes, but itâ€™s not a sure thing,"" tiger expert James L. David Smith told Weekly Reader. He says that people who live closest to the tigers need to help protect them."	3
"Bright-colored birds fly through the air. Monkeys leap from tree to tree. Jaguars creep on the ground below. Those are just a few of the thousands of animals that live in the Amazon rain forest. The Amazon in South America is the largest tropical rain forest in the world. A tropical rain forest is a thick forest in a warm region with heavy rainfall. People are destroying the Amazon. Each year, farmers and loggers cut down rain forest trees to make room for farms, homes, and roads. Scientists have recently discovered that the Amazon is shrinking twice as quickly as they once thought. The Amazon rain forest is one of the richest areas of the world in animal and plant diversity, or variety. Many of the foods, spices, and medicines people need come from the Amazon. The Amazon rain forest also helps recycle Earthâ€™s air. The trees give off oxygen for people to breathe. Trees also clean the air by taking in carbon dioxide. Too much carbon dioxide in the air is harmful to humans. Stopping people from destroying the rain forest is not an easy task. ""Almost 2 million people make the forest their home,"" scientist Jim Bowyer told Weekly Reader. ""All these people need land for farming and wood for heat and cooking. They are looking for a way to survive. Solutions need to involve the very people who destroy the forest."" April 22 is Earth Day. How can you help protect our planet?"	3
"Nine-year-old Selso, his sister, and his brothers never had a toilet or electricity in their house. The house had only two rooms, and at night they all slept together on the dirt floor. The tsunami (soo-NAH-mee) that hit one year ago destroyed their home. Much has changed in a year for Selso and his family. Volunteers with Habitat for Humanity recently built them a new house. More important, the workers brought hope. ""My parents are so happy. My mother had tears in her eyes,"" Selso told Weekly Reader. Habitat for Humanity is a group that builds new homes for people who are poor. Habitat volunteers from seven countries, including the United States, traveled long hours to help families who lost their homes in the tsunami. Selsoâ€™s family worked side by side with the volunteers. Selso lives in a small fishing village by the sea near Kanyakumari, India. India was one of 12 countries hit by the tsunami on December 26, 2004. Tens of thousands of people lost their lives. ""We knew people who died, but my family was lucky. We only lost our home,"" says Selso. A year later, many people in India are still homeless. Volunteers plan on building another 10,000 homes there over the next two years. ""[The volunteers] didnâ€™t even know us, but they came here to help,"" says Selsoâ€™s dad. ""This is the happiest day for my family. My children now have a safe, dry home where they can do their homework."" Selsoâ€™s family is thankful to have a home and clean water. What are some things for which you are thankful? Along with rebuilding homes in India, volunteers are installing (setting up for use) plumbing. That way, families can have clean water. Clean water is important for good health.

"Why did dozens of harlequin frog species start vanishing 20 years ago? Scientists studying the brightly colored frogs might have solved the mystery. The experts blame a skin fungus for causing the frogs to die off. A fungus is a form of plant life that can cause disease in animals. Harlequin frogs are not the only creatures in danger of dying out because of the disease. ""This fungus is killing amphibians all over the world,"" scientist Cynthia Carey told Weekly Reader. An amphibian is an animal with a backbone that spends part of its life in water and part on land. Frogs, toads, and salamanders are amphibians. They are cold-blooded, which means their body temperature depends on their environment. Scientists are working to save the worldâ€™s amphibians. Many of these creatures have already become extinct, or died out completely. Disease is not the only danger for amphibians. Their habitat is being destroyed as people cut down trees in the areas where the animals live. Hunting, pollution, and weather changes are also contributing to the problem. Is there any good news for frogs and other amphibians? The new findings will lead to more research, says Carey. The research could help scientists save the remaining animals before the fungus spreads. ""Weâ€™ve identified the disease and how it works,"" scientist Karen Lips told Weekly Reader. ""Now we can try to stop it."""	3

"More people are taking an interest in Chinese culture. Here, A busy street in China. Woodstock is one of a growing number of U.S. schools teaching Mandarin. The schools want to prepare students for a future in which they are likely to work with people from China. Business in China is booming, and that trend is expected to grow. The U.S. government is trying to encourage even more public schools to teach Mandarin. Officials are considering spending about $1 billion on Chinese programs in schools. China is getting involved too. The Chinese government has donated textbooks to U.S. schools. Some schools are also taking part in teacher exchange programs with China. ""It is important for students to learn Mandarin and Chinese culture,"" Mary Patterson, the principal of Woodstock, told Weekly Reader. ""Students who do so will have wider opportunities when they become adults."" More people speak Mandarin than any other language in the world, yet the language is one of the most difficult to learn. It doesnâ€™t look or sound anything like English. The Chinese writing system does not use an alphabet of letters. Characters, or symbols, represent words and ideas. ""You canâ€™t sound out words,"" says Claire Diller, 9. ""In Chinese, you have to memorize the words."" However, all the hard work hasnâ€™t stopped young learners.

Lions and elephants and cheetahs, oh, my! If some scientists have their way, those animals will roam much closer to home. A team of scientists wants to bring endangered African animals to the Great Plains. The Great Plains is a range of land in the center of North America. The goal of the bold, or daring, plan is to help save African animals from becoming extinct. The scientists say that their plan is to move the animals to protected parks with fences. Many scientists think the plan is a bad idea. They argue that the animals should not be moved to a new habitat. A habitat is a place where an animal or a plant lives. They say the focus should be on saving the endangered animals of North America. A problem is a difficult situation that needs to be solved. A solution is a way to solve the problem.

"Cree Hayuga from New Mexico is at an age when most kids like to hang out with their friends. Instead, this fifth grader spends three hours each week training dogs. Cree is one of more than 100 kids who volunteer at Assistance Dogs of the West. The program is one of many around the country that train service dogs. The dogs are taught to become the eyes, ears, and hands of people who have disabilities. Each dog in the program learns a total of 90 commands. The dogs learn to open and shut doors, turn lights on and off, throw away trash, and pick up items. When Cree grows up, she wants to be a veterinarian, which is an animal doctor. Cree says that training dogs has taught her to be patient and responsible. ""It's really fun,"" she told Weekly Reader. ""The animals get really attached to you, and it's hard to say good-bye.""

"Snakes, insects, and other critters are invading Austin Dulany's classroom. Austin, 8, is one of Peggy Garner's thirdgrade students at St. Mary's School in Bryantown, Maryland. Each spring, Garner transforms, or changes, her classroom into the Amazon rain forest. A rain forest is a thick forest in a warm region with heavy rainfall. The Amazon is located in South America. It is the largest tropical rain forest in the world. Garner decorates her classroom with leafy plants and hanging vines. Her students learn about the foods and spices found in the Amazon. Students make life-size replicas, or models, of toucans, snakes, and other animals that live there. ""The Amazon is where a lot of animals live,"" Austin told WR News. In fact, the Amazon is home to more species, or types, of plants and animals than any other place in the world. Garner's lesson has a serious side too. Since 1970, an area of the Amazon nearly as big as Texas has been destroyed. Loggers have cut down trees to make room for homes, roads, and farms. That has put many plant and animal species at risk. To help protect the Amazon, Garner's students are raising money to adopt land in the rain forest. Brazil's government is also working to save the region. Recently, a section of the Amazon as big as Illinois was placed under government protection. Kelsey Phipps, 8, hopes more people work together to protect the Amazon. ""Many kinds of plants and animals will be lost forever if people continue to destroy the rain forest,"" she says. The Amazon rain forest is home to a variety of animals. Here are a few of them."	3
American scientists have reason to cheer. This year, for the first time since 1983, Americans have won all of the Nobel Prizes in science. Five U.S. scientists will be presented with their prizes on December 10 in Sweden. Sweden is a country in Europe. One winner, Roger Kornberg, is the son of a previous Nobel Prize winner. His father, Arthur, won in 1959. This is the eighth time since 1915 that a parent and child have each won a Nobel award. The Nobel Prizes are a huge honor. They have been awarded each year since 1901. A Swedish scientist named Alfred Nobel (1833â€“1896) created the awards. Winners receive a gold medal, a diploma, and about 1 million dollars.	3
"Is a picture really worth a thousand words? The answer is yes. A new study shows that learning about art helps kids improve their language skills. The study included hundreds of third graders who took part in an art program. It is called Learning Through Art. The program was set up by the Guggenheim Museum in New York City. They placed artists in schools to teach the kids. Many schools across the country have cut art to make more time for math and reading. Officials at the art museum hope the news will persuade, or convince, more schools to teach art. ""When you look at art and talk about it with other people, you learn to observe things more carefully,"" the art program manager Rebecca Shulman Herz told WR News. ""You also learn to think for yourself."""	3
Planets arenâ€™t the only things making their way around the sun. Our solar system is home to thousands of bits of ice and rock of all shapes and sizes, called asteroids. Some astronomers are keeping their eyes on the sky for asteroids. Astronomers are scientists who study space. They are working to figure out when a space rock might hit Earth. Scientists hope that rockets might be used to knock an asteroid off course. Asteroids provide clues to how our solar system formed. Many scientists believe that asteroids are left over from the time the sun and planets formed, about 4.6 billion years ago.	3
"Every Friday, Cody Lozano, 8, and his sister, Cherokee, 9, each carry a heavy backpack home. Their bags are not filled with books, though. They are stuffed with food. Cody and Cherokee are in the BackPack club at their school in Tyler, Texas. On Fridays, kids in the program are given backpacks full of donated food to take home. (Donate means ""to give to a charity or a good cause."") The goal of the club is to help kids who face hunger. About 14 million children in the United States come from families who struggle to buy food. Free school meals help those kids during the week, but they still need to eat on the weekends. That is where the BackPack club comes in. ""Itâ€™s a great way to make sure kids eat over the weekend,"" program director Robert Bush told WR News. BackPack clubs throughout the United States help as many as 35,000 kids each week."	3
"Dâ€™Angeli takes his pet bats to schools and museums. ""People who once feared bats tell me my programs helped them get over their fears,"" he told WR News. Giant Indian fruit bats, or flying foxes, hang upside down all day in large groups, called ""camps."" Sometimes thousands of them are found in one tree!"	3
Scientists in England are buzzing about a recent discovery. They figured out how bees and other insects fly so well. The research is part of a plan to build tiny aircraft. Cameras and sensors could be attached to the aircraft. These machines may one day be used for monitoring traffic or even for spying. The scientists learned that bees' wings are stiff at the front and are flexible (can bend easily) at the back. That allows the insects to lift off the ground and move in the air.	3
Scientists recently reported finding fossils of the largest bird ever known. (A fossil is the remains of a plant or an animal that lived long ago.) The creature is one of a group called terror birds. They lived millions of years ago in Argentina, a country in South America. Until now, scientists had known only of terror birds that were between 5 feet and 9 feet tall. The newly discovered bird stood 10 feet tall. Its head was as big as a horse's head! Terror birds could not fly, but they could run fast. They were skilled predators. A predator is an animal that feeds on other animals. The terror birds chased down rodents and reptiles and snapped them up for dinner.	3
"Lights, camera, action! Charlotteâ€™s Web is spinning from the page onto the big screen. The movie hits theaters on December 20. It is based on the popular childrenâ€™s book by E. B. White. The story is about the unlikely friendship between a pig and a spider. Many childrenâ€™s movies, from The Wizard of Oz to Stuart Little, were based on books. However, bringing a book to life isnâ€™t always easy. ""The book is such a classic,"" Charlotteâ€™s Web director Gary Winick told WR News. ""We had to make sure that all of the wonderful classic moments were in the film."" A classic is a book or another work that stays popular over a long period of time. Although filmmakers stuck to the bookâ€™s plot, they made some changes for the movie. For example, new charactersâ€”two crowsâ€”were added for laughs. ""They [are] the comic relief,"" says Winick. Filmmakers sometimes have to cut long stories to fit a movie time frame. Turning a short tale, such as The Cat in the Hat, into a full-length film can be just as hard. At the same time, moviemakers have to figure out how to stay true to the book. E. B. White (1899â€“1985) was born in Mount Vernon, New York. His full name was Elwyn Brooks White. He worked as a reporter for several newspapers and magazines. In 1939, White and his family moved to a farm in Maine. There, he was inspired to write childrenâ€™s books about animals. He wrote Stuart Little in 1945. That book was followed by Charlotteâ€™s Web (1952) and The Trumpet of the Swan (1970). All three books are classics. Is it better to read the book first or see the movie first? Why?"	3
"Shaquille O'Neal is happy, and it's not because he made a free throw. The basketball star is thrilled that the National Basketball Association (NBA) brought back the leather ball this month. For the past few months, NBA players had to use a new ball. The ball was covered with a synthetic, or human-made, material. Many players had complained about the new ball. They said it didn't bounce as well as the old ball. The new ball also cut their hands. David Stern, the head of the NBA, heard the players' complaints. Stern agreed the decision to use the new ball was rushed. ""The right thing is to listen to our players,"" he told The New York Times. Scientists compared the two types of basketballs. Their study showed that the new ball was less bouncy. The biggest difference they found, however, was in the way the ball soaks up moisture, or wetness. The synthetic ball soaks up less moisture when the players sweat than the leather ball does. ""The surface becomes slick,"" Kaushik De, a scientist who helped lead the study, told WR News. Now that the leather ball is back, many NBA players are relieved. ""For the league to be successful, obviously the players have to be happy,"" says LeBron James of the Cleveland Cavaliers. ""The basketball is the most important thing to us."" Basketball began in 1891 in Springfield, Massachusetts. Physical education teacher James Naismith (1861—1939) invented the game. At first, players tossed soccer balls into peach baskets. Open-ended baskets were not used until 10 years later. Until then, players had to fetch the ball from the basket every time they scored."	3
"Tiger cub twins and a pair of baby orangutans have become unlikely friends. The four are playmates at the Taman Safari zoo. The zoo is located in Indonesia, a country in Asia. The animals were abandoned, or left, by their mothers shortly after birth. The four play, tease, and cuddle up for naps. ""This is unusual and would never happen in the wild,"" says zookeeper Sri Suwarni. Orangutans and Sumatran tigers live only in the wild in Indonesia. Both animals are endangered, or in danger of dying out. Loggers have destroyed much of their rain forest home."	3
"Pennies are not small change to Sylvester Neal. The Washington man is on his way to collecting a million of them. ""Sometimes I walk with my head down looking for pennies"" Neal, 62, told WR News. Will the penny collector have that chance much longer? The U.S. Mint reports that it costs more to produce, or make, a penny than a penny is worth. Is the penny worth it? Both sides of the debate put in their two cents. Lawmaker Jim Kolbe from Arizona recently presented a plan to get rid of the penny. He told WR News that his plan calls for rounding ""all final sales, up or down, to the nearest nickel."" Here is why Kolbe and others say we should lose the penny: Mark Weller leads the group Americans for Common Cents. Its members are working to save the penny. ""Americans want to keep the penny,"" he told WR News. Hereâ€™s why Weller and others support keeping the coin: Alyssa Mayorga is known as the ""Penny Princess."" The 11-year-old from California saves pennies to buy bulletproof vests for police dogs. She recently raised money to buy vests for seven police dogs in Pennsylvania and Maryland. Each vest cost $400. ""I feel like Iâ€™m helping the dogs when theyâ€™re on duty so they wonâ€™t get hurt,"" Alyssa told WR News. For more information, visit www.protect-a-dog.com. Should the penny stay or go? Discuss in class."	3
"Silly, playful, and wacky. Many people describe Jack Prelutsky's poems for kids that way. His newest book—Good Sports: Rhymes About Running, Jumping, Throwing, and More—just hit stores. Prelutsky was recently named the first-ever Children's Poet Laureate. A laureate is someone who receives an award or honor. Prelutsky received the honor from the Poetry Foundation. He will hold the title for two years and act as an adviser to the group. ""Generations of children have learned to love poetry through Jack Prelutsky's work,"" says John Barr, the foundation's president. Take a peek at a poem about baseball from Prelutsky's new book."	3
"September 17 to 23 is Constitution Week. During this week, kids across the country will learn about the U.S. Constitution. How much do you know about that famous document? Unscramble the five words below to complete the sentences. The U.S. Constitution was signed on September 17, 1787. The beginning of the document is called the __ __ __ __ __ __ __ __ (PAMBLEER). It begins with the words ""We the __ __ __ __ __ __ (OPLEEP) of the United States ... "" The Constitution can be amended, or changed. The first 10 amendments are called the __ __ __ __ (LIBL) of Rights. Those amendments protect our __ __ __ __ __ __ (RISTGH) and __ __ __ __ __ __ __ __ (DOMSFREE)."	3
"Some manatees swim in warm waters off the coast of Florida. These playful, plant-eating animals are often called sea cows. They get their name from their large size. Florida manatees almost became extinct, or died out completely. In the 1970s, there were only about 1,000 manatees left. Today, there are more than 3,000. As a result, Florida recently took the manatee off its list of endangered species. Endangered species are animals or plants that are at risk of dying out. The first laws to protect this creature were passed in the late 1970s. Those laws made it illegal to hunt manatees. As the number of people in Florida grew, however, more manatees died. Many manatees were injured by or killed in boat crashes. Others became tangled in fishing gear. Not everyone thinks it is a good idea to remove manatees from the list. Many scientists worry that the animals will not receive the same protection they once did. ""We canâ€™t celebrate yet,"" manatee expert Patrick Rose told WR News. Officials in Florida say manatees will still be protected under the countryâ€™s Endangered Species Act. That law protects threatened plants and animals. ""There will be no less protection,"" says wildlife expert Henry Cabbage. Should manatees have been removed from Floridaâ€™s endangered species list? Why or why not?"	3
Scientists have made a giant fossil find—a new type of dinosaur! It is the largest dinosaur ever discovered in Europe. The creature was about 125 feet long and weighed about 48 tons. It was longer than an NBA basketball court and as heavy as seven elephants! The dinosaur lived 145 million years ago, during the late Jurassic Period. It was a sauropod. A sauropod is a large plant-eating dinosaur with four legs, a long neck, and a small head. Scientists named the dinosaur Turiasaurus riodevensis, for the region and village in Spain where it was found.	3
Thousands of volunteers are getting ready to take the plunge to protect the world's waters. Dive In To Earth Day is a worldwide celebration. During the week of April 22, volunteers will participate in activities to preserve, or save, the world's water and sea life. Water makes up about threefourths of Earth's surface. Some people will clean beaches, and others will go on dives to clean polluted water. Dive In volunteers have removed about 190 tons of trash from coastal areas since 2000. Trash left in the sea can harm coral reefs. Coral reefs are made of tiny sea animals called polyps. As polyps die, they leave behind hard shells. Other polyps grow on top of the shells. Polyps form coral reefs over many years. Coral reefs are important because they supply food and shelter to ocean creatures.	3
"Thousands of kids recently got a sneak peek at the world of the future. They saw more than 150 inventions at this yearâ€™s NextFest. It was a four-day festival that was held in New York City. Many of those inventions were right out of the lab. Some were still being developed. Many of the creations were exciting, but the robots stole the show. They came in all shapes and sizes. In the future, some of those robots may be used to help with dangerous space missions. Others may be used to assist, or help, people who are sick. Here are a few of the robo-helpers. This robot is the life of the party. It knows how to ballroom dance. The robot can match a partnerâ€™s dance steps. The inventors say that a similar robot may one day be used to assist elderly, or old, people by walking with them. Robonaut may one day help astronauts in space. It is being designed by NASA, the U.S. space agency. The robot can work on its own or be controlled by a human operator. A special headset shows the operator what the robot is seeing. ""Robonaut has been designed to perform tasks that, up until now, only astronauts could do,"" says NASA engineer Roger Rovekamp. This baby harp seal robot is not just a toy. It was created to improve peopleâ€™s moods and help them relax. The robot, named Paro, responds to touch and sound. ""Animals are used for animal therapy at hospitals and nursing homes,"" its inventor, Takanori Shibata, told WR News. ""Some people cannot own animals because of allergies."" Donâ€™t let this photo fool you! Actroid may look real, but she is actually a robot. She can greet and entertain people. When Actroid talks, she moves her hands and makes eye contact. ""I got to see some awesome exhibits,"" says WR News kid reporter Michaela Ritz. The 11-year-old met robots and played life-size video games at NextFest. Then she spoke with inventors to find out more. Which was her favorite invention? Brainball. ""It is a game in which you needed to relax in order to get the ball into the opponentâ€™s circle,"" says Michaela. ""Your brain waves are monitored to see how calm you are. I enjoyed this game because it was a nice way to calm down and relax."" Which of these inventions will be the most useful for people in the future? Explain your answer."	3
"WR News kid reporter Lexi Brooks, 10, attended a big event recently. She saw former U.S. Presidents George H. W. Bush and Bill Clinton receive the 2006 Liberty Medal. The Liberty Medal is awarded each year to a person or group that shows leadership and helps others. Clinton and Bush raised more than 1 billion dollars to help the survivors of two disasters—Hurricane Katrina in 2005 and the tsunami that hit southern Asia in 2004. December 26 marks the second anniversary of that tsunami. The award ceremony was held at the National Constitution Center. It is located in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. There, Lexi heard Clinton and Bush give speeches. ""The presidents...encouraged people to join their efforts and help each other,"" says Lexi."	3
"September 11, 2001, was a day Americans will never forget. Two airplanes hit the twin towers of the World Trade Center. Those buildings were in New York City. People took over the planes by force. After the crash, the towers fell to the ground. More than 2,700 people died. Now, five years later, a new tower is set to rise. Builders recently presented plans for the Freedom Tower. The tower will be one of the tallest buildings in the United States. It will stand 1,776 feet tall. That number is the year the Declaration of Independence was adopted. The site around the tower will have a memorial. A memorial is something that honors a person or an event. The area will also have a museum. ""By 2012, we should have a completely rebuilt World Trade Center—more magnificent â€¦ than it ever was,"" says one of the builders."	3
"How can two boys who live halfway around the world become friends? Ask Ryan Hreljac (HURL-jak) of Ontario, Canada, and Akana Jimmy of Uganda, a country in Africa. A new book shares their story. It is called Ryan and Jimmy and the Well in Africa That Brought Them Together. When Ryan was 6, he learned about the lack of clean drinking water in some parts of the world. Ryan raised money to help build a well in Jimmyâ€™s village. The two boys became pen pals, then friends when Ryan traveled to Uganda in 2000 to see the well. Four years ago, Ryanâ€™s family arranged to bring Jimmy to live at their home in Canada. ""We used to live as friends,"" Jimmy told WR News, ""but now we live as brothers."" Ryan has raised more than $1.5 million. The money has helped build more than 200 wells in 11 countries, most in Africa."	3
People in Chinese communities around the world celebrate the holiday. It lasts for 15 days. Festivities include music, dancing, fireworks, feasts, and parades. Each year in the Chinese calendar is named after one of 12 animals. This year is the Year of the Pig. Study the chart to learn more. Which animal represents the year in which you were born?	3
New Jersey is set to have the strictest school nutrition laws in the country. The state passed a bill in January to ban the sale of junk foods in elementary and middle schools. A bill is a proposed law. The law goes into effect in September. As part of the ban, candy and sodas are not allowed to be sold. Elementary schools can sell only milk, water, or 100 percent fruit and vegetable juice. The bill also limits how much fat and sugar can be in foods served to students. Why the strict laws? Poor nutrition habits have caused many kids in the United States to become overweight. That can lead to health problems. The purpose of the new bill is to help students make better nutrition choices.	3
"Fifth grader Brenna Croal of Minnesota is a true hero. Last month, she was honored by her community for saving her grandmother's life. Her grandmother was eating dinner when she began choking on a piece of bread. ""She was gasping for air and couldn't breathe or cough,"" Brenna told WR News. ""I went over to her and got my hands in the position and did the Heimlich (HIGHM-lik) maneuver."" The Heimlich maneuver is a special move that can help save the life of a person who is choking. If someone is choking, he or she can't speak, cough, or breathe. Brenna is a safety captain at Hoover Elementary School. She learned the Heimlich maneuver at safety camp last summer. 1. Stand behind the choking person and wrap your arms around his or her waist. 2. Make a fist with the thumb side against the person's stomach, between the belly and the rib cage. Grab your fist with your other hand. 3. Press your hands in with a quick upward thrust. Repeat until the person stops choking."	3
Hispanic Heritage Month begins September 15 and lasts until October 15. When people celebrate their heritage, they are honoring their culture's traditions. Hispanic Americans are people whose families came to the United States from Spanish-speaking countries. September 15 marks the date that five of those countries gained their freedom. Hispanic Americans are the fastest-growing group in the country. That news is from the U.S. Census Bureau. Almost 43 million Hispanic Americans live in the United States. One of every seven people in this country is Hispanic. During this month, Americans honor Hispanic traditions and history. Many people take part in festivals and parades. Music and dancing are often a big part of the fiesta (fee-ESS-tah), or party. How will you celebrate Hispanic Heritage Month?	3
Welcome to the city of ice! Beginning January 5, the city of Harbin in northeastern China transforms, or changes, into a winter wonderland. The ice festival is a popular tourist attraction. It has been drawing crowds for 33 years. Organizers expect millions of visitors to pour into the cityâ€™s parks this year. There, they will see hundreds of snow sculptures and some huge buildings made with bricks of ice. Harbin is the coldest city in China. The temperature in the city is below freezing for more than six months of the year. (The freezing point of water is 32 degrees Fahrenheit.) In Harbin, the temperature can fall below zero. That gives people there a great opportunity, or chance, to build with tons of snow and ice. In fact, they use enough snow and ice to fill 90 large swimming pools! In December, 3,000 workers began creating the winter amusement park. They carved giant castles, friendly dragons, slippery slides, and even working restaurants out of ice. Some of the buildings and sculptures have colorful lights that are lit up at night. Many of the ice sculptures are made by teams of artists from around the world. When visitors come to look at the creations, they have to watch their step. Not only are the buildings made of ice, but so are many of the walkways and railings! The ice festival changes each year. Here are some buildings and sculptures that have been part of the festival in the past. What kind of sculpture or building would you like to see built out of ice? Why?	3
"On May 14, 1607, about 100 men and boys from England landed on the marshy coast of present-day Virginia. They had crossed the Atlantic Ocean aboard three ships. Their mission was to start a colony, or new settlement, in North America. The colony was named Jamestown, after King James I of England. The settlers, or colonists, struggled with hunger and disease. It was not easy to build a town on the swampy land, but the colonists refused to give up. This year marks the 400th anniversary of Jamestown's beginning. Thousands of people are expected to attend events at Jamestown to learn about the first permanent English settlement in North America. Visitors will have a chance to travel back in time. ""The whole idea is to give people an idea of the world of Jamestown in 1607,"" historian Tom Davidson told WR News. He helped create the exhibits at the settlement site. The exhibits give visitors a look at artifacts, or human-made objects. Those artifacts include tools, clothing, and weapons. The settlers built a small, triangle-shaped fort so their homes would be protected. ""There were hundreds of people living very close together,"" Davidson explained. The small settlement at Jamestown grew to become the first of the 13 colonies. Those colonies later became the United States. A powerful Native American group called the Powhatan lived on the land when the English colonists settled Jamestown. At first, the Powhatan leader was friendly, but soon the two groups began fighting. They made peace in 1614 when Pocahontas married an Englishman. She was the daughter of Chief Powhatan. Pocahontas went to England, where her portrait was painted. The peace did not last, though. The colonists drove the Powhatan off the land."	3
"Kids plant flowers at a park in New Orleans. The park was hit last year by Hurricane Katrina. Eight-year-old Mikia Kirton remembers the water rising as Hurricane Katrina hit the city of New Orleans. ""We had to swim out,"" she tells WR News. ""We had life jackets on."" Mikia stayed at shelters with her family before moving to Houston, Texas. That was one year ago, but change is still a part of Mikia's everyday life. This year, she will live with her grandmother in Texas while her mother returns to work in New Orleans. Mikia's family is one of many whose lives have changed since Hurricane Katrina hit the Gulf Coast. More than 1,000 people died in the storm. Many more lost their homes and had to move to other states. Those who return home face the huge task, or job, of rebuilding. New Orleans was one of the hardest-hit areas. Streets are still a mess. Homes are empty. Playgrounds remain closed. Most of the city's schools were destroyed in the storm. About 55 of 128 schools are expected to reopen this fall. Some students will attend classes in trailers. They will be separated from friends who have not returned to New Orleans. Some kids who returned to the city have helped with the repairs. As part of a summer program, they planted flowers in parks and built benches at bus stops. The kids also talked about what had happened. ""I am now used to a whole new lifestyle,"" 12-year-old Duriel Harris wrote in a journal. ""Every day now is different from my pre-Katrina days."" Many of the kids in the summer program created projects about their lives. Here, Duriel Harris, 12, explains his family tree. His family is rebuilding their home. It was flooded with 6 feet of water from Hurricane Katrina."	3
"Public schools across the country are going on a health kick. Students are saying good-bye to junk food and hello to better eating habits. Kids are also exercising more during the school day. Itâ€™s up to school districts to decide how to enforce the law. Many schools are offering healthier choices for lunch. In Tennessee, most schools have removed junk food and soft drinks from vending machines. In their place are choices such as granola bars, nuts, water, and juices. In Florida and Texas, some schools have new rules that restrict, or limit, desserts served for parties. They want kids to eat healthier treats. To provide students with plenty of exercise, a Minnesota school district has scheduled more physical activity during the day. Many school districts are also making sure that kids have recess every day. The goals of the new law are to promote good health and to fight obesity. Obesity is the condition of being very overweight. Experts say the percentage of young people who are overweight has tripled since 1980. Being obese can lead to serious health problems. ""We know that adults who are very overweight get sick more often and lose time at work,"" Julia Lear told WR News. She is the director of the Center for Health and Health Care in Schools. ""We want healthy futures for our kids. The best thing to do is get kids in the habit of getting lots of exercise and eating healthy meals."" The food pyramid helps people make good food choices. A rainbow of stripes represents the five food groups. The thin yellow stripe represents fats and oils. It shows that people should eat only a small amount of fats and oils. The person climbing the pyramid is a reminder to do something active for at least 60 minutes each day. What can you do to get moving?"	3
"A piece of the nation's capital will honor an important leader—Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. A memorial for King is being built on the National Mall in Washington, D.C. It will be the first memorial on the Mall to honor an African American. A ceremony was held on November 13 to mark the start of construction. President George W. Bush and other leaders were among the thousands of people who gathered for the event. If all goes as planned, the memorial will be finished in 2008. It will have trees, flowing water, and a 30-foot statue of King. Quotes from King's speeches will be carved into a stone wall. King (1929—1968) grew up in the U.S. South. At that time, the South was segregated, or separated by race. Under the law, black people were not allowed to attend the same schools as white people. They were forced to sit in the backseats of buses. They also had to use separate restrooms and drinking fountains. King worked to change the laws by giving speeches and leading peaceful marches. Thanks to King and other leaders, civil rights laws were passed. Those laws make sure that all Americans are treated equally. On August 28, 1963, Martin Luther King Jr. gave a speech in Washington, D.C. A crowd of more than 200,000 people came to hear him. In his speech, King said, ""I have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character."""	3
Koalas are pictured everywhere in Australia—from boxes of chocolate to sports team jerseys. Yet the animals live only in small areas along the east coast. The koalas were once widespread on the east coast. However, farmers cut down many of the forests where koalas lived. Hunters also killed the animals for their fur. I recently joined Bill Ellis and his team in a forest on St. Bees Island. Ellis is a scientist who studies koalas. He and other scientists hope that studying koalas on the island will teach them how to protect koalas elsewhere in Australia. We spotted a koala named Abby in a blue gum tree. The blue gum is a species, or type, of eucalyptus (yoo-kuh-LIP-tuhss) tree. The leaves of eucalyptus trees are the main food source for koalas. Whenever we find a koala, we collect information about the trees in the area. We measure how tall and how fat the trees are. Then we put tags on their trunks, so we know theyâ€™ve been recorded. We also capture and tag the koalas. Before releasing them back into the wild, we give them a health checkup. Ellis wonders if the St. Bees koalas are headed for hard times. The island is filled with wild goats, which may be eating small blue gum trees. Ellis hopes more research will help him understand how to protect the blue gums—and the koalas that depend on them. 1. Volunteers shake a tree branch on which a koala named Yellow sits. Yellow falls onto a plastic sheet and is placed into a sack. 2. Volunteers hold Yellow in the sack. They adjust a radio collar around the koalaâ€™s neck. 3. The colored tag on Yellowâ€™s ear helps scientists tell that koala apart from others on St. Bees Island.	3
"A low-cost laptop has been designed for poor children around the world. Several countries should receive the laptops in 2007. Big plans are under way for a little green machine. Itâ€™s a laptop computer made for kids who live in poor countries. A program called One Laptop per Child plans to sell the laptops at a very low cost to the governments of those countries. Many poor areas donâ€™t have electric power. The ""green machine"" does not need to be plugged into an electrical outlet. The laptop runs on electricity produced by a hand crank. One Laptop per Child plans to test the computers this fall. The program hopes to start shipping millions of green machines in 2007."	3
"The past few months have been busy for Democrat Nancy Pelosi. In January, she became the first female Speaker of the House of Representatives. The House and the Senate are the two chambers that make up the U.S. Congress. That branch of government makes the country's laws. ""This is a historic moment for the Congress and for the women of this country,"" says Pelosi. Pelosi has said that she wants to be judged by her abilities, not by her gender. ""Becoming the first woman Speaker will send a message to young girls and women across the country that anything is possible for them,"" she adds. Pelosi leads the 435 members of the House. She is third in line for the presidency, after the vice president."	3
Each year, 6 million to 12 million Americans get lice. In fact, that is the number-one reason that kids miss school. Now the National Parent Teacher Association is fighting back against the little pests. The group has started a national program called Keeping Our Kids Lice Free. Lice can spread very quickly from one person to another. The bugs canâ€™t jump or fly, but they can crawl. Follow these tips from health experts to keep lice from bugging you:	3
"People need clean drinking water to live. In poor countries, millions of people donâ€™t have clean water. Their water is filled with germs that can make people sick. Germs are living things that can be seen only with a microscope. About 6,000 people, mostly children, die each day because of unsafe drinking water. To help solve the problem, a company has invented a special straw. It makes unsafe water clean for drinking. The invention is called LifeStraw. It is a plastic tube with filters to block many types of germs. ""We hope to save and enhance the lives of many people around the world, especially children,"" LifeStraw spokesperson Brian Hollingsworth told WR News. (Enhance means ""to improve."") The company hopes the straw will be available as soon as 2007."	3
"The world's tallest living man recently saved the lives of two sick dolphins. The dolphins swallowed plastic from their pool at an aquarium in China. Veterinarians, or animal doctors, couldn't figure out how to remove the plastic. Surgery would have hurt the dolphins too much. The doctors had the idea to ask for help from Bao Xishun from Mongolia. Bao is 7 feet 9 inches tall. His arms are about 3½ feet long! Bao used his long arms to reach into the animals' mouths and remove the plastic from their stomachs. ""The two dolphins are in very good condition now,"" aquarium manager Chen Lujun told reporters."	3
"Eight-year-old Hunter Hill watched as soldiers stepped off an airplane. He was on the lookout for someone specialâ€”his dad. A year ago, Sergeant Douglas Hill left for Iraq. Now he has come home. ""Weâ€™re going bug hunting, playing video games, and camping together,"" Hunter told WR News. Hunter is one of thousands of kids who were reunited, or brought back together, with family members at Fort Campbell. Fort Campbell is an army base in Kentucky. More than 10,000 families live on the base. About a year ago, 20,000 soldiers from Fort Campbell were sent to serve in the Iraq war. More than 136,000 U.S. troops are stationed, or in place, in Iraq. They are working to bring peace to the region. Since the war began in 2003, more than 2,600 U.S. troops have died. The war has also cost the United States more than $300 billion. Among Americans, support for the war has dropped. A recent poll shows that 60 percent are against the war. They want troops to come home. Others say peace needs to be brought to Iraq first. For many families at Fort Campbell, the wait for their loved ones is almost over. The rest of the baseâ€™s troops will be home in time for Thanksgiving. Though the soldiers may be sent back to Iraq in the future, their families can breathe a sigh of relief for now. ""There are no words to describe how happy I am,"" says Hunterâ€™s mom, Kristine. If you had to leave your family, what would you miss most? Why?"	3
"Do you want to travel to another galaxy or solve a mystery? All you have to do is open a good book. That is the message to kids from the 2006 National Book Festival. Kids and their families will attend the festival on September 30. It is being held on the National Mall in Washington, D.C. First Lady Laura Bush is hosting the festival. She will welcome more than 70 well-known authors. One of those authors is Andrew Clements. He wrote the childrenâ€™s book Lunch Money. ""Good books make good things happen in real life,"" says Clements. ""They can make a big difference."""	3
"You might know about meerkats from Timon, a character in The Lion King. Now the small animals are getting more attention. Scientists from England say that meerkats teach their kids, just as humans do. ""Wild meerkats school their young,"" say the scientists. Meerkats grow to a standing height of 12 inches. They weigh about 2 pounds. Meerkats live in southern Africaâ€™s deserts in groups as large as 30. They are the only known mammals besides humans to teach their young. A mammal is a warmblooded animal that feeds its young with milk. Most animal youngsters just copy what they see. Meerkats, however, show their pups how to catch insects and other prey. Prey is an animal that is eaten by another animal. Scientists watched as young meerkats were taught how to handle dangerous scorpions without getting hurt."	3
"Put on your party hat. This year, Mesa Verde (MAY-suh VEHR-day) National Park in Colorado has reason to celebrate. A century ago this past summer, the U.S. government set aside the land as a national park. (A century is 100 years.) The park protects the site of an ancient Native American city. All year, the park has celebrated with special events. They included tours of the cliff homes and Native American dances, music, and stories. December 9 marks the finale (fuh-NA-lee), or big ending, of the celebration. On that night, park rangers will light up two of the largest cliff homes with about 100 lanterns. The celebration honors the Native American tribe that built Mesa Verde. The tribe is called the Ancient Pueblo (PWEH-bloh). They are the ancestors of todayâ€™s Pueblo people. An ancestor is a family member who lived a long time ago. The Ancient Pueblo lived in the area from about 600 to 1300. They lived on the mesa top until the 1100s. A mesa is a large, high rock with a flat top and steep sides. Later, they moved down to the sides of the cliffs and built homes there. ""Itâ€™s not often that you come across a hundred years of something special,"" Mesa Verde park ranger Dan Puskar told WR News. ""It provides us the chance to look forward to the next 100 years and make sure this place stays preserved and enjoyed by the public."""	3
"Dixon Dubow, 9, recently gave away some of his Lego bricks. The third grader from Raleigh, North Carolina, donated them to the Lego brick drive. Donate means ""to give to a good cause."" The Lego drive was held for kids in New Orleans, Louisiana. Many schools there lost classroom supplies when Hurricane Katrina struck in 2005. More than 1.6 million Lego building bricks were collected. Kids like Dixon donated half the amount. The rest was supplied by the Lego company. The Legos were given to New Orleans schools at a special ceremony. Artist Nathan Sawaya also presented a model of New Orleans that he built with Lego bricks. Dixon was happy to give to other kids. ""I hope that collecting Lego bricks will help them so they can feel better,"" he says."	3
"The United States is growing! The population will reach 300 million by late October, say officials at the U.S. Census Bureau. A population is the number of people living in a certain area. Who will be number 300 million? That's anybody's guess. It could be a newborn baby. On average, a baby is born every eight seconds in the United States. The 300 millionth person could be an immigrant. An immigrant is someone who moves to a country where he or she was not born. Many immigrants come to the United States in search of freedom or a better life for themselves and their families. The country adds a new immigrant about every 31 seconds. Because of the mixture of people and their different cultures, the country is sometimes called a melting pot. With the 300 million mark getting close, more people are talking about our country's future. For some, the growth is good news. They believe that the United States will have more power. Others argue that a larger population means more traffic jams and fewer jobs. ""[The 300 million mark] is like a birthday,"" Howard Hogan of the Census Bureau told WR News. ""It's a number that gives us an opportunity to see where we've been and think about where we want to go."""	3
"Marine animal experts are on a mission. They want to save Hawaiian monk seals from becoming extinct. Extinct means ""no longer existing."" Today, about 1,200 seals live near the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands. Experts fear that the population will drop in the next five years. ""The clock is ticking,"" says scientist Jen Palmer. Experts worry that the seals are not getting enough food. Many of the pups are thin and are not living past their first few years. Scientists are trying to figure out why. Other scientists are monitoring the monk sealsâ€™ habitat for pollution. A habitat is a place in nature where an animal or a plant lives. ""Every person takes a very tiny bit of the puzzle, and you hope at some point you ... put it all together and it makes a pretty clear picture,"" says scientist Charles Littnan."	3
"It's a bird! It's a plane! Wait ... it's a moose! Wildlife workers recently moved 24 moose from Utah to their new home in Colorado. The moose traveled part of the way hanging from helicopters. The helicopters safely transported, or moved, the animals to trucks for a six-hour drive. So far, more than 90 moose have been brought to Grand Mesa, Colorado, that way. The idea for the project began six years ago when a Colorado man thought of bringing moose to Grand Mesa for the first time. ""There was a big meadow full of willows, and it looked like there should be a moose standing there,"" Roger Shenkel told WR News. Shenkel shared his idea with officials at the Colorado Division of Wildlife (DOW). The DOW spent years studying Grand Mesa's habitat. A habitat is the place where an animal or a plant naturally lives. When officials decided that the area was suitable for moose, the DOW workers set out to find some of the animals to live there. Utah needed more bighorn sheep because their numbers have dropped. In exchange, or trade, for the moose, Colorado sent about 20 bighorn sheep to Utah in February. ""Here in northern Utah, we have too many moose,"" Justin Dolling of the Utah DOW told WR News. ""We made a trade."" Animal overpopulation can be a big problem. That happens when too many animals live in one area. Those animals can run out of food. Wildlife officials help solve the problem by moving animals to areas where they can find enough food. The map shows how moose and bighorn sheep were swapped this year to keep both groups of animals healthy."	3
Do you recognize the monument above? Itâ€™s the Parthenon, an ancient temple in Athens, Greece. The temple sits on a famous hill called the Acropolis. A huge hot-air balloon recently flew over the area. The launch celebrated the New 7 Wonders of the World vote. The goal of the vote is to make a new list to go along with the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World. Those structures were built between 4,500 and 2,200 years ago. Only one of the ancient wondersâ€”the pyramids of Egypt at Gizaâ€”is still standing. The Acropolis is one of 21 choices from which to vote. The New 7 Wonders of the World will be announced in July 2007.	3
"You don't have to travel to Asia to see sloth bears slurp up insects. You can see the shaggy-coated creatures at the National Zoo in Washington, D.C. The zoo opened a new exhibit, called the Asia Trail, in October. Sloth bears and six other species, or types, of animals from Asia have new homes at the National Zoo. Those animals face several threats in the wild. Before the Asia Trail opened, the animals lived in tight spaces. Now they have twice the room. The changes are part of a 10-year plan to update the zoo. ""This is a giant leap forward for the National Zoo,"" says its director, John Berry. ""Our goal is to be the world's finest zoo by 2016."" Giant panda cub Tai Shan (tie-SHAHN) and his parents are the stars of the show. They help draw huge crowds to the zoo. Three million people are expected to visit this year. The giant pandas' new home includes more trees for climbing. Pandas like water, so their area has a waterfall and pools. Fog machines help make the exhibit more like their habitat, or natural home, in China. Visitors now have closer views of the giant pandas and other animals. ""You can see, hear, touch, and even smell the zoo's science,"" says Susan Ades, head of the new design. The National Zoo is home to 2,000 animals. Along with fishing cats, clouded leopards, sloth bears, and Japanese giant salamanders, the creatures here live on the Asia Trail. Is it important for zoos to create homes that are like the animals' natural habitats? Why or why not?"	3
"Afew days after his 10th birthday, Jordan Romero had another reason to celebrate. Last summer, the fifth grader from Big Bear Lake, California, set a mountain-climbing record. He became the youngest person to climb Kilimanjaro (kih-luh-muhn-JAR-oh) in Africa. ""It was fun,"" Jordan told WR News. Kilimanjaro is one of the Seven Summits. A summit is the highest point on a mountain. The Seven Summits are the highest mountains on each of the seven continents. After Jordan learned about the summits in school, he decided to climb them in the next few years. This month, Jordan plans to climb to the top of Mount Kosciusko (kah-zee-UHSkoh) in Australia. Mountain climbers face several risks, including severe, or harsh, weather. Climbers can also become dizzy or tired at high elevations. (Elevation is height above sea level.) Kilimanjaro is more than 19,000 feet high. Jordan practiced for the climb by hiking up mountains near his home for one year. Thanks to his training, Jordan climbed Kilimanjaro in just three days. ""I knew I could make it to the top because I did not want to fail,"" he says. With last summer's success behind him, Jordan is gearing up for Mount Kosciusko. Each summit Jordan tackles brings him one step closer to his ultimate goal: reaching the top of Mount Everest. Everest is the world's tallest mountain. ""I will never stop mountain climbing,"" Jordan says. ""I think it's great."""	3
"Giant pandas have reason to celebrate! Until recently, scientists thought only about 1,600 were left in the wild. A recent study suggests that there may be as many as 3,000 giant pandas. The news is hopeful, but the pandas are still in danger of dying out. They once lived in most of China. Now their habitat, or home, is much smaller. It is being destroyed as people cut down trees for wood and farming. Scientist Michael Bruford led the study. He told WR News, ""We were surprised but very happy with the news. Pandas may have a better chance of surviving now."""	3
Parties and stunts at the Great Wall of China are now against the law. A stunt is a dangerous or an unusual act that is done for attention. In 2005, Danny Way became the first person to jump over the Great Wall on a skateboard. Over the years, many tourists have climbed the famous wall. Others have jumped over the wall on motorcycles. Parties and stunts have caused serious damage to the Great Wall, say officials. The Chinese government has now issued new rules to protect the famous landmark. The Great Wall is the longest structure ever built. It twists and turns for more than 4,000 miles through China. Parts of the wall are more than 2,000 years old.	3
"By now, you know you can ignore that section on Pluto in your science books. A group of the worldâ€™s astronomers recently decided that Pluto is no longer an official planet. An astronomer is a scientist who studies space. This drawing shows the spacecraft New Horizons as it nears Pluto and its moons. New Horizons is the fastest spacecraft ever built. Despite the change, a spacecraft named New Horizons is on its way to learn more about Pluto. New Horizons launched in January. It is expected to fly by Pluto in 2015. Astronomers say it will give humans a first look at Pluto and other objects in the Kuiper (KIGH-per) belt. The Kuiper belt is a band of objects in the outer area of our solar system. Astronomers have long known that Pluto was different from the other eight planets. Pluto had an odd orbit, or path, around the sun. It was also the smallest and coldest of the group. At their meeting, the astronomers agreed on a new definition for a planet. A planet must be nearly round and must circle the sun. Its orbit should not cross the orbit of another planet. Plutoâ€™s orbit crosses Neptuneâ€™s. Now there are only eight ""classical"" planets in our solar system: Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune. Pluto still has a place in space, though. It is one of a new group of smaller objects called dwarf planets. The two other members are Ceres (SIHR-eez), the largest asteroid, and a space object nicknamed ""Xena."" As many as 12 dwarf planets are expected to be announced in the coming months. The list will keep growing as new objects are discovered. ""These dwarf planets are popping up everywhere,"" astronomer Alan Stern told WR News. He is the leader of the New Horizons mission. Pluto was discovered in 1930, long after the other planets had been found. It was discovered by the American astronomer Clyde Tombaugh (1906-1997) using a telescope in Flagstaff, Arizona. He didnâ€™t name Pluto, though. An 11-year-old British girl named Venetia Burney did. She thought the new planet should be called Pluto, after the Roman god of the underworld. Not all astronomers agree that Pluto should no longer be a planet. What do you think? Why?"	3
"Darrel Frost never forgot the first time he saw a diamondback snake. It was in Arizona, and he was only 4 years old. He spied the snake around a tree. ""It was the most beautiful animal I had ever seen,"" he recently told an audience. Frost is now a scientist at the American Museum of Natural History in New York City. He helped set up the exhibit ""Lizards and Snakes: Alive!"" WR News got an inside look at the new exhibit. It runs until January 2007 and has more than 60 live squamates (SKWAH-mayts). Squamates are members of a group of reptiles that includes lizards and snakes. Reptiles are cold-blooded and often covered with scales. Most reptiles lay eggs. Jack Conrad, a scientist at the museum, felt that the timing was right for this exhibit. People are ""really interested in scaly, slimy things,"" he told WR News. The exhibit teaches visitors about these wild and scary creatures. Scientists continue to find new fossils of reptiles. A fossil is the remains of a plant or an animal that lived long ago. ""Many squamates havenâ€™t changed in 200 million years, since dinosaurs roamed the Earth,"" says Conrad. If you could create an exhibit about something that interests you, what would it be? Why?"	3
"A volcano in the Philippines has rumbled to life. It is Mayon, the countryâ€™s most active volcano. The last time Mayon erupted was in 2000. Since August, it has been spewing ash and lava. Lava is hot liquid rock. The eruptions have destroyed crops and forests. Thousands of people live near the volcano. They were ordered to evacuate. Not everyone decided to leave, though. ""My mother said that we would not evacuate now unless thereâ€™s a big eruption,"" said 13-year-old Jennilyn Nantes on her way to school. To protect people, scientists use special equipment to track changes in the volcano. They say that Mayon is becoming more dangerous. Scientists warn that deadlier eruptions could happen at any time."	3
"Millions of butterflies begin their amazing journey once again. The orange-and-black-winged insects are in the middle of their yearly 2,500-mile trip from Mexico to Canada and the northern United States. Monarch butterflies migrate, or travel to a new location, when the season changes. Each spring, tens of millions of monarchs from Mexico head north. In the fall, they will fly to Mexico for the winter months. Elizabeth Howard created the Web site Journey North. The site studies monarchs and tracks their travel patterns. ""They travel farther than any other migratory animal or insect on the planet,"" she says. ""What's most amazing is they go to the same place every winter [and spring], even though they've never been there before."" People who track monarchs are worried that the butterflies will become endangered, or at risk of dying out completely. Illegal logging in Mexico is thinning forests. The butterflies seek shelter in forest trees during the winter. Increasing temperatures are also threatening the butterflies' survival. ""There is a good chance that we will see big changes in the monarchs' migratory patterns in the next several decades,"" says monarch expert Karen Oberhauser. ""My hope is that monarchs will be able to adapt."" Some monarch butterflies live for just a few weeks. Others may live up to eight months. Each butterfly races to complete its leg of the journey and produce the next generation before it dies. Parent butterflies leave Mexico in March. Their children are born in the southern United States. Those butterflies travel north. Grandchildren butterflies are produced in the north, where they spend July. Finally, it is the great-grandchild of the first butterfly that returns to Mexico. It will remain there for the winter."	3
As the wheels on the bus go round and round, many kids are being bounced around. A new study shows that about 17,000 accidents occur on school buses each year. Injuries range from cuts to broken bones. Researchers report that crashes aren't causing all of those injuries. Kids are sometimes thrown around when buses stop and turn. Some people say those injuries could be prevented if school buses had seat belts. Traffic safety experts say seat belts would not reduce, or lower, injuries. Not all injuries occur when kids are in their seats. Nearly one-quarter of injuries occur when kids are getting on and off the buses. School buses are still the safest way for kids to ride to school, says the National School Transportation Association. The number of kids injured is only a small fraction of the nearly 24 million kids who travel on school buses each year.	3
"Skateboarding is rolling into gym class! ""Skateboards get kids moving,"" physical education (PE) teacher Richard Cendali told WR News. Cendali teaches at Douglass Elementary School in Boulder, Colorado. He is the first PE teacher in the country to teach the sport. During the past 10 years, team sports have become less popular. Sports such as skateboarding, yoga, and rock climbing are on the rise. They are known as ""the new PE."" These sports help keep kids from becoming obese, or very overweight. Being obese can lead to health problems. Not every kid likes to play team sports. Learning individual sports gives them a way to stay fit. ""Skate class is more fun than regular PE, and [it is] a better workout,"" says Joyce Mason, an eighth grader at West Middle School in Aurora, Colorado."	3
"Fish may be a rare sight by 2048. That is what a team of scientists predicted after making a four-year study. They say ocean life is being wiped out by pollution and too much fishing. The loss of ocean life will mean less food. It will also affect the balance of the oceanâ€™s ecosystem, say the scientists. An ecosystem is a group of plants and animals and the environment working as a unit to live. The studyâ€™s lead author, Boris Worm, says that itâ€™s not too late to reverse the problem. He told reporters, ""Our children will see a world without seafood if we donâ€™t change things."""	3
"Scientists recently made a fishy discovery. They found 52 new species, or types, of ocean creatures off the coast of Indonesia. That is a country in Asia. The new species live in the Birdâ€™s Head Seascape. It is part of the ""Coral Triangle."" The Coral Triangle is a big area in the Indian Ocean. It is home to more than 1,200 species of fish and almost 600 species of corals. The discoveries include 24 species of fish, 8 species of shrimp, and 20 species of corals. Corals are tiny animals that build stony skeletons. Groups of corals are called coral reefs. Many sea animals, such as fish, live in the brightly colored coral reefs. Scientists are pleased with their discoveries, but are worried that the creatures may be in trouble. Indonesiaâ€™s government may let people fish in the area where the newly discovered species live. The people would catch as many fish as they could and then sell the fish to stores and restaurants. Scientists fear that overfishing may cause some of the new species to become extinct. Extinct means ""having died out completely."" Scientists also worry that people may ruin the coral reefs while they are fishing. We need to ""make sure these species are protected,"" Sherry Flumerfelt of the Coral Reef Alliance told WR News. Scientists say only a tiny number of the worldâ€™s marine animals have been found. Why might finding new ocean creatures be a difficult task?"	3
"Author Angela Johnson takes readers on a journey in her new book, Wind Flyers. She writes about the Tuskegee Airmen. They were the first African American pilots in the U.S. military. The group learned to fly airplanes in Tuskegee, Alabama. The Tuskegee Airmen served during World War II (1939—1945). They escorted, or guided, U.S. fighter planes during the war. Johnson says the story of the Tuskegee Airmen can encourage people to follow their dreams. ""There will always be people who want to keep you from doing something,"" she told WR News. ""You just have to go on and do absolutely everything you can."""	3
Whatâ€™s the weather forecast for today? Thatâ€™s a question for TV weatherman Al Roker. WR News kid reporter Cara Batelli, 10, visited Roker on the set of the Today show to ask him about his job and hurricanes. The Atlantic hurricane season has been under way since June. It ends in November. Cara: Why is it important to teach people about the weather? Roker: If you know what the weather is, you can stay safe and protect yourself, especially when there are severe storms. Cara: Have you ever been scared in weather? Roker: I was on television during Hurricane Wilma [in 2005]. The wind was so strong that I got blown over on live television. Cara: What is the best thing to do when a hurricane is approaching? Roker: Listen to authorities; when they say get out, get out. Cara: Why is weather so hard to predict? Roker: You are really predicting the future, and thatâ€™s never an easy thing to do.	3
Get ready to change your clock. On March 11, 2007, daylight saving time begins. On that date, most people in the United States will turn their clocks forward an hour. That gives us more daylight at the end of the day in the spring and summer. This is the first year that daylight saving time begins in March instead of April.	3
"Kids are giving Earth a big hand. They have joined other volunteers in a tree-planting celebration in 10 large cities across the United States. The events are organized by the National Arbor Day Foundation. About 100 trees are being planted in each location. ""I had a fun time planting trees,"" says Jenelle, a thirdgrade student at Wilshire Elementary School in San Antonio, Texas. ""[Trees] are important to animals."" Trees help purify, or clean, the air. They take in carbon dioxide and produce oxygen. People could not survive if the air had too much carbon dioxide or too little oxygen. The trees are also being planted because they add beauty to city neighborhoods and provide shade. Arbor Day traces its roots to Nebraska. In 1872, J. Sterling Morton started the holiday in that state because Nebraska was almost treeless. Today, National Arbor Day is celebrated each year on the last Friday in April. This year, it takes place on April 27. Many states, however, celebrate Arbor Day on different dates based on their best tree-planting times. The holiday encourages people to plant and care for trees."	3
Cooking can be fun, but it can also be a recipe for disaster. More fires start in the kitchen than in any other room in the home, says a national fire protection group. That is why the theme of this yearâ€™s Fire Prevention Week is Prevent Cooking Fires: Watch What You Heat. Kids who like to cook donâ€™t have to stay out of the kitchen. However, they should ask an adult for permission first, say fire officials. There are many tasty treats you can make without using the stove or oven. For recipes and cooking safety tips for kids, go to www.firepreventionweek.org. Happy safe cooking!	3
"Calling all bookworms! Summer vacation is around the corner. What titles are you planning to pull off bookshelves? Here are some exciting reads from the American Library Association (ALA). Each is a different genre, or type, of book. ""Whether in a car, on a plane, or in your backyard, these books can take you places you have never been,"" says ALA's Julie Walker. A fantasy is a story set in an imaginary world with unusual characters and events. In The Fungus That Ate My School, by Arthur Dorros, what starts out as a science experiment ends up taking over the school! A biography is a true story about a person's life. Find out how Dr. Seuss spent his childhood days, in The Boy on Fairfield Street: How Ted Geisel Grew Up to Become Dr. Seuss, by Kathleen Krull. Fiction is a made-up story. In Whales on Stilts! by M. T. Anderson, a mad scientist plots to take over the world using robotlike whales that walk on stilts and have laser-beam eyes."	3
"Some kids who want to play tag are out of luck. The game has been banned at Willet and McCarthy elementary schools in Massachusetts. (Banned means ""not allowed."") Those students are not alone. A growing number of schools across the country have put an end to the playground game. Recess is safer without tag, say some school officials. At Freedom Elementary School in Cheyenne, Wyoming, the game often led to pushing and fighting. ""To be safe, [all students] must keep their hands and feet to themselves,"" the principal, Cindy Farwell, told WR News. Others think banning tag goes too far. ""It's telling children we don't trust them to be safe when they play games,"" says Rhonda Clements. She teaches physical education at a college in New York. Clements also says kids should be able to choose whom they play with and what they play."	3
Mark your calendar: Tuesday, November 7, is Election Day. Itâ€™s an important day for democracy in the United States. Democracy is a system of government in which the citizens vote for the people they want to lead the country. Many schools across the country will be closed so the buildings can be used as polling, or voting, places. People will vote for representatives and senators to represent them in Congress. Congress is the group of leaders that makes our nationâ€™s laws. This election is called a midterm election because voters are not choosing a new president. Voters choose a new president every four years. The next presidential election will be held in 2008. You will be allowed to vote when you are 18. In what year will you be able to vote?	3
"Astronauts are aiming for the moon again. This time, though, they plan to stay there. Astronauts hope to live and work on the moon by 2020, according to NASA. The U.S. space agency recently announced plans to build a base there. At first, four-person crews will stay for a week. By 2024, they will be able to live there for as long as six months. The base will most likely be built near the moon's north or south pole. The poles get the most sunlight. At those locations, the moon base would be able to use solar power. That is energy from the sun that can be used to create electricity. The moon is the only place beyond Earth that humans have visited. At a distance of about 238,900 miles, the moon is Earth's closest space neighbor. So far, only 12 people have walked on the moon's dusty surface. Those astronauts traveled there on Apollo missions from 1969 to 1972. NASA hopes the moon mission will kick off a new era, or time period, of space exploration. Scientists say that living on the moon is the first step in preparing astronauts to travel to Mars. ""By demonstrating we can survive on another world for a long time, we build confidence that we can venture much farther from Earth and stay for longer periods of time,"" NASA official Michael Braukus told WR News."	3
"Life is good for penguins in Antarctica at the end of the movie Happy Feet. Real-life penguins, though, have little to celebrate. Twelve of the world's 19 penguin species face major threats, according to wildlife experts. They are in danger of becoming extinct, or dying out completely. This list includes emperor penguins. ""Many of the world's penguin species are in big trouble,"" penguin expert Kassie Siegel told WR News. Her wildlife group is asking the U.S. government to protect the 12 threatened species of penguins. Overfishing is partly to blame for the problem. Penguins eat small fish and tiny shrimplike animals called krill. Fishing boats are catching large amounts of krill. That leaves less food for penguins to eat. Another reason for the decline in the number of penguins is global warming. Global warming is the slow increase in average temperature around the world. It is causing sea ice to melt. Penguins need the floating sea ice as a place to rest while they search for krill. Scientists say people contribute to global warming when they drive cars or use electricity. That burns fossil fuels, such as coal, oil, and natural gas. The burning of fossil fuels gives off gases that add to the overheating of Earth. ""We can and must reduce gas emissions to keep penguins safe in the future,"" says Siegel."	3
"The United Nations has a new leader. He is Ban Ki-moon from South Korea. Ban will take office on January 1, 2007, as the U.N secretary-general. Ban replaces Kofi Annan. Annan has been secretary-general for the last 10 years. The United Nations was set up in 1945, shortly after World War II ended. The groupâ€™s main purpose is to bring all nations together to work for peace. At this time, the United Nations has 192 member countries. The General Assembly includes people from each member country. They meet to discuss world problems and suggest ways to solve them. After being chosen secretary-general, Ban spoke to the General Assembly. He said, ""The true measure of success for the U.N. is not how much we promise but how much we deliver for those who need us most."""	3
What is special about November 11? It is Veterans Day. On this holiday, Americans honor U.S. veterans. Veterans are men and women who have served in the armed forces. The United States has almost 25 million veterans. Members of the U.S. armed forces receive awards for their military service. Here are some of the medals.	3
Tourists can now see the Grand Canyon from a new angle. A glass walkway lets visitors step out over the canyon. The structure, which opened in March, is called the Grand Canyon Skywalk. It is shaped like a horseshoe and juts, or extends, 70 feet beyond the canyon's edge. A canyon is a deep, narrow valley with steep sides. The Grand Canyon, in Arizona, was carved by the Colorado River over millions of years. Looking down from the skywalk, people can see the canyon floor 4,000 feet below. The Hualapai (WAH-luh-pie) Indians, who live near the Grand Canyon National Park, allowed the structure to be built. Some tribe members hope the skywalk encourages tourists to visit the natural wonder. The glass walkway can hold the weight of a few hundred people, says architect Mark Johnson. Hualapai leaders and two former astronauts were the first people to set foot on the new skywalk.	3
"Third grader Erin Doherty turned the corner and gasped. A full-color statue of George Washington (1732—1799) on a horse towered over her. ""He looked real,"" Erin told WR News. Erin was on a field trip with her class to Mount Vernon, in Virginia. Mount Vernon was once Washington's home. Today, it includes a new museum about his life. The museum features three life-size wax statues of the country's first president. One statue depicts, or shows, Washington at age 19. Another shows him as a military leader at age 45. At that time, he led the American army that fought the British for our nation's independence, or freedom. The third statue shows Washington, at age 57, being sworn in as the first U.S. president. A team of experts used evidence, or proof, from history to make the statues look real. They made a computer model of Washington using earlier statues and paintings. That helped the team show Washington at different ages. This will be the first Presidents' Day that the new statues are on display. The statues are among the many exhibits at the new museum. Visitors can also watch a high-tech movie about Washington's life. Snow seems to fall inside the theater, and the seats shake with cannon fire. ""You feel that you are part of Washington's battles in the Revolutionary War,"" Mount Vernon education expert Ann Bay told WR News. George Washington isn't the only famous U.S. president to come to life recently. The people who created the new museum at Mount Vernon were inspired by the Abraham Lincoln Presidential Library and Museum. It is located in Springfield, Illinois. The Lincoln museum is home to a ""ghost library."" There, the use of special effects makes Lincoln (1809—1865), the 16th president, seem to appear in the room."	3
Imagine diving into a world filled with giant starfish and yellow sea lilies. That is what scientists from New Zealand recently did. New Zealand is an island country near Australia. Scientists spent five weeks studying sea life in the Ross Sea. That is a body of water near Antarctica. Antarctica is the southernmost place on Earth. The team used special cameras to see all the way down to the seafloor. They collected more than 30,000 specimens, or samples. They found eight types of fish that may be new to scientists. Some of the marine, or sea, creatures the scientists found are bigger than similar creatures in other parts of the world. The starfish, for example, are 2 feet wide. Some starfish in other seas are less than 1 inch wide. The scientists say they hope their discoveries will teach people about Antarctica’s marine creatures. “These results contribute to our understanding of how ... [the sea life in] this area is connected,” says scientist Niki Davey.	3
What do athletes Kyle Bennett, Jill Kintner, and Bubba Harris have in common? The superstar young cyclists are all hoping to land a spot on the first U.S. bicycle motocross (BMX) Olympic team. BMX racers ride laps around bumpy tracks and jump over mounds of dirt while trying to avoid wiping out, or crashing. BMX racing is just one of several new events that will be part of the 2008 Summer Olympics, a sporting event in which athletes from around the world compete. The Summer Olympics take place every four years. This summer, the Olympics will run from August 8 to 24 in Beijing. That is the capital of China, a country in Asia. About 10,500 athletes from 202 countries will compete in more than 300 events. Besides BMX racing, other new sporting events include a table-tennis team event and a 10-kilometer swimming competition. About 600 Olympians from the United States have their eyes on the prize: an Olympic gold medal. An Olympian is a competitor in the Olympic Games. Some U.S. athletes have already qualified for the Olympics. The U.S. BMX Olympic team will be decided by June. The team will include three men and two women. Harris, of Palmdale, Calif., is one BMX rider ready to race for gold. “The Olympics are huge, exciting, and the biggest thing to hit BMX in a while,” he says. “I know all I have to do is ride my heart out, every lap.” For hundreds of years, athletes from around the world have participated in the Olympics. Read the time line to learn more about the games. 776 B.C. The earliest known Olympic Games were held in Greece. There was only one eventâ€”a 200-yard sprint. 1900 Women were allowed to compete in the games. Tennis player Charlotte Cooper took first place in Paris. 1968 Track star Jesse Owens was the top Olympic performer in the games in Berlin. He won four gold medals.	3
Have you ever imagined having a conversation with a robot? Some scientists hope to one day give people that chance! A team at the University of Plymouth in England will attempt, or try, to teach a robot how to talk. England is a country in Europe. The humanoid is called iCub. A humanoid has human qualities, such as the ability to speak. The robot is about 3 feet tall and has a babylike face. Scientists plan to begin teaching iCub how to talk next year. They want to find new information that will lead to the development of robots that can think, learn, and communicate. “We are interested in studying robots’ ability to help us,” scientist Giulio Sandini told WR News. “We would like the robots to be able to communicate with us.”	3
"Talk about a really BIG discovery! Scientists recently uncovered the bones of a huge dinosaur in Argentina. That is a country in South America. The big dino was about 43 feet tall and 105 feet in length. Its neck was more than 50 feet long! (Let's hope it never got a sore throat!) The dinosaur has a name almost as long as its neck. It's called Futalognkosaurus dukei. Its name comes from local words that mean ""chief"" and ""giant."" Experts think the dino is a new dinosaur species because its neck is unique. Unique means one of a kind. Scientists know the dinosaur was an herbivore. An herbivore eats only plants. The big plant eater lived about 88 million years ago."	3
"Butterfly lovers have reason to cheer. A kind of endangered butterfly has recently returned to its habitat, or home. Endangered means at risk of dying out completely. The butterfly is called the El Segundo blue. The rare blue insects have returned to Santa Monica Bay, Calif. Plants had overgrown the butterflies' habitat. Scientists took some of the butterflies to a special place to protect them. Other scientists worked to restore, or repair, their habitat. Amazingly, the butterflies began to fly home. That surprised the scientists. The blue butterflies usually fly only about 200 feet. They flew more than 1,000 feet to get home. ""We didn't think they could fly that far,"" Ann Dalkey told WR News. She is a spokesperson for the group working to save the butterflies. ""We're so excited."""	3
"Imagine staring into the face of a 3,300-year-old king. That is what scientists in Egypt recently did. Egypt is a country in Africa. Scientists displayed the mummy of King Tutankhamen (too-tahn-KAH-mun) for the first time in history. A mummy is a body that has been prepared to last for a long time. King Tut became the ruler of Egypt when he was 9 years old. He ruled for 10 years. Tut died at age 19. His tomb, or burial place, was discovered in 1922. Tut was buried wearing a gold mask. Scientists removed it to show the king's blackened face. The team also moved the mummy into a special glass case to protect it. ""The face of the golden boy is amazing,"" spokesperson Zahi Hawass said inside the tomb. ""It has magic, and it has mystery."""	3
"Sure, Boy Scouts know their way around a campsite, but can they outsmart bullies? The Boy Scouts of America organization is making sure that they can. Recently, it added a new section to its handbook. New scouts must demonstrate, or show, that they know how to handle bullies. Rehearsing, or practicing, what to say to a bully is one way to avoid being pushed around. The Boy Scouts also suggest sticking close to friends. Spencer Anderson, 9, of Greenwood Village, Colo., follows that tip. ""Bullies don't usually like to mess with more than one kid,"" the scout told WR News. How can you stop a bully? Here are some tips from the 2008 Boy Scout Handbook. (1) If ignoring a bully doesn't work, stand up for yourself with words. Practice what you want to say. For example, if a bully is making fun of your clothes, ask the bully why he or she cares. (2) Tell the bully how hurtful being bullied feels. Ask why you are the target. Then ask the bully to stop."	3
"Some people think ladybugs bring good luck. Let's hope that's true for some people living in New York City! The owner of a large apartment complex recently let loose 720,000 ladybugs. The insects, or bugs, were released in the garden. It was being destroyed by plant-eating insects, such as aphids and mites. Ladybugs are natural predators of plant-eating insects. A predator is an animal that feeds on other animals. A ladybug can eat up to 50 insects a day. The ladybug colony will eat billions of insects. A colony is a large group. The ladybugs were shipped from a company in Bozeman, Mont. ""[By the time they reached New York] they were lively and ready to eat anything that was not too quick for them,"" company owner Eric Vinje says."	3
"Scientists in Canada are playing Go Fish. They recently counted sharks that swim in the Atlantic Ocean off the coast of Canada. Why? To find out how many sharks there are, of course! Some, such as the porbeagle shark, were once in danger of becoming extinct. The porbeagle shark is a species, or type, of shark. People hunted them for their meat and fins. Now, laws protect porbeagle sharks in the Atlantic Ocean. Scientists want to make sure porbeagles are still safe. Traveling in boats, scientists caught about 1,000 sharks. Most were porbeagles. The scientists put tags on the female sharks and released them back into the ocean. The tags will allow the scientists to monitor, or watch, the sharks in the coming months. Scientist Steve Campana took part in the shark count. He says not all sharks are safe like those near Canada. ""Worldwide, sharks are in trouble,"" he told WR News."	3
Hello! My name is Jasmine Padilla. I'm 8 years old and in the third grade. I live in a town called Tusayan. It is a town next to Grand Canyon National Park. My family has lived here a long time. I go to Grand Canyon School. The Grand Canyon has very tall cliffs for walls, and it is so wide that the trees on the other side look like trees for ants! The rocks are shades of pink and brown. My favorite time of year in the Grand Canyon is winter. I like the winter because we play in the snow and can make a snowman. I also like to play with my friends and hike. I have seen rabbits, deer, and elk. Sometimes I can hear coyotes howling.	3
"Have you ever been in a bad storm? McKenna Andrews, 10, has. She and her family remained, or stayed, in their Mississippi home during Hurricane Katrina. That storm hit the Gulf Coast in 2005. McKenna used her experiences during the storm to write a book. It is called Riding the Storm Out. Her story recently won a Mom's Choice Award from the Just For Mom Foundation. Riding the Storm Out is based on real-life events. During the hurricane, a huge wave swept eight dolphins from Marine Life Oceanarium in Gulfport, Miss., into the ocean. McKenna's book is written from the dolphins' point of view. McKenna grew up watching the dolphins. ""I was going to swim with the dolphins right before Hurricane Katrina happened,"" she told WR News. The dolphins now live in an aquarium in an island country called the Bahamas. McKenna says for her next writing project she is planning a sequel, or second book. It will be about the dolphins' new home."	3
Think you're king when it comes to playing checkers? Then you haven't played against Chinook, a computer program created by scientists in Canada. Even if a person played a perfect game against Chinook, the game would end in a tie. Scientists needed about 18 years to perfect the program. That's because checkers isn't as simple as it seems. With 24 pieces and 64 squares on the board, the game has about 500 billion billion possible positions. That's a 5 followed by 20 zeros! Scientist Jonathan Schaeffer wrote much of the program. He says he hopes the program will help scientists create an intelligent computer someday. Intelligent means able to reason or solve problems. Would you jump at the chance to play Chinook? Then go to www.cs.ualberta.ca/~chinook.	3
"Do you like to run? Zhang Huimin, 8, of China, does. She ran from southern China's Hainan province, or region, to Beijing this summer. She completed the run in just 55 days. She ran a total of 2,212 miles! That's about the distance from New York City to Utah. Zhang wore out 20 pairs of sneakers! She began her training every day at 2:30a.m. ""Running makes me happy,"" she told the news service Reuters. But some medical experts aren't happy. They say all that running is bad for Zhang's growing body. Zhang's father—and trainer—disagrees. He organized the run to help promote, or support, next year's Olympics in Beijing. ""She is always healthy around me,"" he says. He should know. He was always right by her side."	3
"Did you know that chocolate bars are made from a plant? It's true. Chocolate is made from cocoa beans. Cocoa comes from the beans of the cacao (keh-KOW) tree. Chocolate companies buy cocoa. Then they crush, mix, roll, and shape the cocoa in machines. They add other ingredients, such as milk and sugar, to make candy bars. About 70 percent of the world's cocoa comes from west African countries such as Ghana and the Ivory Coast. Earlier this year, there was a drought. A drought is a long period of dry weather. With no rain, less cocoa was produced. Some worry there will not be enough chocolate. There is hope for chocolate lovers. The drought in Africa has ended. ""Production of cocoa beans is expected to increase [by next year],"" Laurent Pipitone, a spokesperson for the International Cocoa Organization, told WR News."	3
At only 11, Abigail Breslin works with famous people and has earned an Academy Award nomination! A nomination is a recommendation for an award. WR News student reporter Christiana Dillard recently interviewed the actor about her new movie, Nim's Island. Abigail plays Nim, a girl who has to protect her island home. Christiana Dillard: When did you know that the character of Nim was right for you? Abigail Breslin: I guess I kind of thought that when I read it. I really liked that she could take care of her island on her own. CD: What is your favorite movie? AB: One of my favorites is Meet Me in St. Louis. It's about a ... family who lives in St. Louis right during the time of the St. Louis World's Fair. They find out that they are going to move ... before the fair. CD: What would you like to be if you weren't an actor? AB: A vet because I would like to ... work with animals.	3
"How does Oklahoma feel about its new state quarter? A-OK! The United States Mint recently created a quarter honoring the state. The U.S. Mint makes currency, or money. The Oklahoma coin shows a scissor-tailed flycatcher. That is Oklahoma's state bird. The Oklahoma coin is one of the last five quarters in the 50 State Quarters Program. Since 1999, the U.S. Mint has created five state quarters each year. The states received quarters in the same order in which they joined the United States. The other states receiving quarters this year are New Mexico, Arizona, Alaska, and Hawaii. The last state to receive a quarter is Hawaii because it was the last state to join the country. Hawaii became a state in 1959. Citizens in those states are eager to put the coins in their piggy banks. ""People have really strong feelings and a lot of pride about their state,"" Michael White, a spokesperson for the U.S. Mint, told WR News."	3
"Some criminals call them double trouble. Their names are Lucky and Flo. They are black Labradors. Recently, the dogs found 1.6 million pirated DVDs. To pirate means to copy something without permission. The dogs found the DVDs in Malaysia. That is a country in Asia. The pups are the world's first dogs trained to find DVDs. They identify, or recognize, them. They do this by picking up the scent of chemicals found in DVDs. Dogs have a strong sense of smell. It is much stronger than the human sense of smell. Thanks to the animals, 26 people were arrested. ""What they have helped us achieve in such a short time is remarkable,"" says an official from Malaysia, S. Veerasingham."	3
"Nigersaurus (NEE-zhair-SAWR-us) is a sauropod that has a mouth that works like a vacuum cleaner. A sauropod was a large plant-eating dinosaur with four legs, a long neck, and a small head. Paleontologists recently discovered most of the bones of a Nigersaurus in the Sahara. That is a desert in Africa. A paleontologist is a scientist who studies dinosaurs. The 110-million-year-old animal was 30 feet long and as big as an elephant. Eating came easy to Nigersaurus. Experts say the dino could gobble up entire fields without taking a single step. Paleontologist Paul Sereno says the dinosaur's lightweight skull and wide mouth allowed the animal to reach short plants. ""Its face was on the ground, mowing down ferns and other things ... like a long-necked cow,"" he told WR News. In addition to its vacuum-like mouth, the dinosaur had about 500 teeth. Behind each tooth were at least eight replacement teeth in case one broke off. Scientists believe this made Nigersaurus a fast eater. Sereno's team recently reconstructed most of the dinosaur's skull and skeleton. Reconstruct means to rebuild. A model of Nigersaurus will be on display at the National Geographic Museum at Explorers Hall in Washington, D.C., through March 18, 2008. ""We're just uncovering Africa's dinosaurs,"" Sereno says. ""It's very exciting."" What do Nigersaurus and the Sahara have in common? Both are huge! In fact, the Sahara is the largest desert in the world. Read on to learn more about the desert. How is Nigersaurus like a vacuum? How is it different?"	3
"Sure, you've heard of horseshoes, but what about dog shoes? This spring, some hounds will be sporting new doggy footwear, but it's not a fashion statement. About 20 police dogs in DÃ¼sseldorf, Germany, will wear blue plastic-fiber shoes when working. Germany is a country in Europe. The shoes prevent, or stop, the animals from being injured. Police say the dogs cut their paws on broken glass during missions. The DÃ¼sseldorf unit includes German and Belgian shepherds. Police will train the pooches to wear the shoes so the animals are protected. ""Now we just have to teach the dogs how to tie their shoes,"" jokes Hartwich."	3
"This month marks the fifth anniversary of the war in Iraq. No one knows that better than Logan Jordan, 9, of Kailua, Hawaii. The third grader's father, Christopher, is a Marine. Christopher Jordan served in the war for two years. He will return to Iraq in September. Iraq is a country in the Middle East. In March 2003, the United States invaded Iraq. To invade is to enter by force. U.S. President George W. Bush thought Iraq's former leader, Saddam Hussein, had weapons that he could use to hurt other countries. No such weapons were found. Today, about 158,000 U.S. troops are stationed, or in place, in Iraq. They are working to help the Iraqi people rebuild their country. The troops are also battling violent groups that don't want the United States there. The goal is for Iraq to one day govern, or manage, itself. However, that is not an easy task. The country has three groups of people with different customs and interests. They are called Sunnis, Shiites, and Kurds. Each group wants to make sure it receives its fair share of power and resources in the new Iraq. Since the war began, more than 3,900 U.S. troops and thousands of Iraqis have died. How long U.S. troops remain in Iraq will be a decision the next U.S. president will have to make when Bush leaves office in January. Until then, service members like Logan's father will continue their work. ""My dad is a brave man,"" Logan told WR News. ""I am very proud of him."" History: People have lived in Iraq for thousands of years. The area was once called Mesopotamia. Resources: Iraq has the third-largest crude oil supply in the world. The country produces about 2.5 million barrels of oil a day."	3
"Batman, have you heard? A new kind of ""batmobile"" is in the works! Scientists in Rhode Island are studying how bats fly. The United States Air Force is funding the $6 million project. It hopes the mammals will offer clues about how to design better-flying aircraft. Mammals are warm-blooded animals that feed their babies milk. Bats can fly in ways that birds and airplanes can't. The animals' wings have more than 24 joints. The joints allow them to manipulate, or control, their wings while flying. Bats can stretch and bend their wings. This helps them fly higher and faster. Scientist Sharon Swartz says bats' control of their wings is similar to humans' control of their hands. ""Bats are the only flying animals whose wings are really just like human hands,"" she told WR News. Swartz and the other scientists will study about 20 species of bats over the next five years. They are using real bats, high-tech cameras, and wind tunnels in their research. The team hopes to find out why bats can turn sharply without falling. If airplanes could do that, they could maneuver, or move, in tight spaces. They could also fly in more dangerous conditions. The Air Force also hopes to learn how weight affects bat flight. Bats can carry up to 50 percent of their weight while flying. If aircraft designers knew bats' secrets, they could design airplanes that could carry more weight. Swartz says there is still a lot more to learn about the animals. ""We expect to be studying bats long into the future,"" she says. It's going to be a hair-raising Halloween for Little Rock Zoo in Arkansas. Three vampire bats were born there recently. Vampire bats are the only type of bat that drinks the blood of other animals. They do this to survive, but don't worry! Vampire bats are usually friendly with people. Of the more than 1,000 bat species, only three are vampire bats. They live mostly in Mexico and Central and South America."	3
"Green is out! Frogs have a new look that has some scientists jumping for joy. Scientists in Hiroshima, Japan, have produced see-through frogs. Japan is a country in Asia. The pale frogs are the world's first see-through animals with four legs. Frogs are often used for scientific research. Now researchers can view organs that are under the see-through frogs' skin. Organs are body parts, such as the heart and lungs. Scientist Masayuki Sumida says the see-through animals provide new ways to study frogs. He says scientists can observe what happens to a frog's organs if it gets sick. ""You can see through the skin how organs grow...,"" he says. ""You can watch organs of the same frog over its entire life."" Frogs are cold-blooded. That means their body temperature depends on their environment. Frogs are also amphibians, which are animals with backbones that spend part of their lives in water and part on land. ""That's one of the things that makes them so interesting to study,"" herpetologist Joseph Collins told WR News. A herpetologist is a scientist who studies reptiles and amphibians. Collins says students also could benefit from studying the see-through frogs. ""Seeing the heart actually pumping and the lungs actually working would be really important to younger students,"" he says. ""It will teach a lot about how the organs work."" Frogs are one of more than 5,000 amphibian species! Keep reading to learn more about some of the other species. Red-Eyed Tree Frog: These colorful frogs have red eyes and blue and yellow stripes. They live in rain forests in Central America. Toad: Toads have stubby bodies with warty skin, and they walk instead of hop. Toads live in most parts of the world."	3
Would you like to visit a galaxy far, far away on your next vacation? Soon, you can! Galactic Suite is the first hotel planned for space. The hotel is scheduled to open in 2012. Architects in Barcelona, Spain, are designing the hotel. An architect is a person who designs buildings. Galactic Suite will cost $3 billion to build. That's a 3 followed by nine zeros! A three-day stay will cost $4 million. The hotel will have three bedrooms. It will be attached to a shuttle rocket. That is how guests will travel to and from space. Before guests can stay at Galactic Suite, they must train at a space camp for eight weeks. While on board, they will travel around the world in 80 minutes and see 15 sunrises per day. Galactic Suite gives space travel a whole new meaning!	3
"Can you imagine winning one of the greatest prizes in the world? Former U.S. Vice President Al Gore can imagine. He recently won the Nobel Peace Prize. He will receive his award at a special ceremony on December 10 in Norway. That is a country in Europe. Nobel Prizes are significant, or important. They are given for achievements in science, writing, and other subjects. They are given to people and groups around the world. Gore is a cowinner of the Nobel Peace Prize. He won for his work to stop global warming. That is the slow rise of Earth's temperature. ""The Nobel Prize is a wonderful honor,"" Gore told WR News. Gore helped create a documentary about global warming. A documentary is a movie based on real life. The movie is called An Inconvenient Truth. It focuses on ways people can improve the environment. Gore's movie is not just for adults. There is a shorter slide-show version of An Inconvenient Truth for kids. A version is another form of something. ""It's important for children to understand [the effects of] global warming,"" Gore says. Nobel Prize winners receive a diploma, a gold medal, and about $1.5 million. Gore plans to give his prize money to an organization that fights global warming. Alfred Bernhard Nobel (1833—1896) created the Nobel Prizes. He was from Sweden. Nobel was a scientist. He made more than 350 inventions. His most famous invention was dynamite. He created the explosive in 1867. Dynamite made blasting through rock easier and safer. Nobel was a millionaire when he died. He left $9 million to fund the prizes that are named after him. The Nobel Prizes are always presented on December 10. That is the anniversary of Nobel's death."	3
"Everyone knows helping others is a good thing - maybe even chimps! Scientists recently studied from Uganda. That is a country in Africa. The scientists did tests that show that chimps often help people or other chimps, even if they get nothing in return. In one test, a person dropped a stick near a group of chimps. In most cases, a chimp handed the stick back to the person. Chimps care about other chimps too. In another test, a chimp handed over the stick when another chimp dropped it. The animals did not receive food or praise for their actions in either test. The results surprised the scientists. They had long thought that humans are the only animals that help others. ""We've never seen this level ... of cooperation in any other animals except humans,"" says chimp scientist Alicia Melis. Cooperation means working together. Scientists say the study suggests that chimps and humans may be born with the ability to be helpful. Chimpanzees are a type of great ape. Great apes are the largest primates. Primates are a group of animals. Other great apes are gorillas, orangutans, and bonobos. The gorilla is the largest primate. A male gorilla can weigh as much as 500 pounds and stand up to 6 feet tall. Gorillas live in Africa. The chimpanzee uses tools more than any other animal does - except humans. A chimp might use a stone to crack a nut. Chimps live in Africa. The orangutan has very long arms. That's because it lives mostly in trees. Orangutans live in Indonesia, a country in Asia. The bonobo is the smallest great ape. They can weigh up to 100 pounds. Bonobos are sometimes called ""little chimps."" Bonobos live in Africa."	3
"The Willow School in Gladstone, N.J., is made of more than just bricks. The insides of the walls include denim from blue jeans! Other parts of the building are made of wood from an old toothpick factory. The Willow School is a green school. That is a school built in a special way to save energy and resources. Green schools also provide a healthy environment for students. Some green schools have rooftop gardens to grow foods for their cafeterias. Others use special window shades to keep the buildings cool on hot days. Across the United States, more schools are going green. The U.S. Green Building Council is an organization that decides whether schools are green. Representatives for the organization say they have approved about 85 green schools. About 650 more schools are waiting to be considered for green school status. Green schools may also benefit, or help, students. Some experts say that students who attend green schools are smarter and healthier. One study found that students in classrooms with natural daylight scored 25 percent higher in reading and math than students whose rooms did not have as much natural light. Willow School students get plenty of natural light. Each classroom is built with a skylight, or a window in the roof. ""Sunlight has an impact,"" Kate Burke Walsh, head of the school, told WR News. ""[The students] have great energy. They're ready to learn."" How can your school help the environment? Keep reading for some ideas. Recycle. Start a recycling program at your school. Everything in your classroom from old papers to art supplies can be recycled. Plant a garden. Ask your teacher if your class can plant an herb garden. The cafeteria can use the fresh herbs in school lunches. Reuse items. Instead of using paper or plastic bags, pack your lunch in a container you can reuse each day. You'll throw away less trash!"	3
"U.S. astronaut Peggy Whitson's job is out of this world! This fall, Whitson became the first woman to lead the International Space Station. She will be there for six months. The space station is being built 220 miles above Earth. Whitson's job is to oversee the construction. She will also help run science experiments on the giant space lab. Whitson's accomplishment is unique because most NASA astronauts are men. NASA is the U.S. space agency. Between 1978 and 2004, fewer than one in five NASA astronauts were women. ""I think it's special that I get the opportunity to play that role,"" Whitson says. ""But I think it's also special to have an opportunity to [show] how many other women also work at NASA."" One of those women is Pamela A. Melroy. She recently flew the space shuttle Discovery to the space station. The visit marked the first time two female commanders were in space at the same time. Melroy helped to construct, or build, the space station. Melroy and her Discovery crew delivered a part named Harmony. Harmony is a hallway that will connect different parts of the space station. Sixteen countries, including the United States, are working on the space station. Once the lab is finished, it will be about the size of a five-bedroom house. The space station should be finished in 2010. In 1983, Sally Ride set a record. She became the first American woman to travel in space. Ride traveled aboard the space shuttle Challenger. The shuttle took off from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida. Today, Ride is in charge of her own company. The company encourages girls to pursue, or work toward, careers in science, math, and technology."	3
"If two heads are better than one, Asimo robots are in luck. The robots were created by Honda Motor Co. Honda recently upgraded the robots so they can work in pairs. The humanoids can share information with each other about what they are doing. A humanoid is a thing that has human qualities, such as being able to speak. Recently, two Asimos worked together to serve drinks to people in Tokyo. That is a city in Japan. The robots' technology allows them to guess people's movements. That helps them avoid bumping into people. The Asimos' creators hope to put the humanoids to work soon. Tomohiko Kawanabe is a spokesperson for Honda. ""By the end of 2010, we'd like to see these robots working at every street corner of [Tokyo],"" he says."	3
"Where were you on August 17 at 8 p.m.? About 17.2 million Americans were sitting in front of their televisions. They were watching the premiere, or first showing, of Disney's High School Musical 2. According to research, that was the most viewers of a cable program ever. High School Musical 2 follows teens Troy, Gabriella, Sharpay, Ryan, Taylor, and friends. School is out for the summer. The teens take on romance, jobs, and more. WR News recently talked to Monique Coleman. She plays Taylor. She is amazed by the success of High School Musical 2. ""I'm excited that the movie managed to [go beyond] all of our expectations,"" she says. Why are the High School Musical movies so popular with kids? Allie L., 7, of New York says it's the music. ""I think we like singing and dancing, and that's what [the characters] are doing,"" she says."	3
"Everyone knows that burping is rude, but cows do it all the time. They do it every 40 seconds! The noisy burst of gas is more than just bad manners. It's bad for the environment. Each belch releases methane. That is a colorless, odorless gas. Methane is one of the gases that contribute to global warming. Global warming is the slow rise of Earth's temperature. Scientists say one cow releases up to 150 gallons of methane a day! All that belching adds up. There are 100 million cows in the United States. They are responsible for 20 percent of the nation's methane production. The methane is produced in cows' stomachs when they digest their food. The gas comes out when cows exhale. Experts are worried about the planet. ""[Cows, and other animals'] contribution to environmental problems is on a [huge] scale,"" officials wrote in a report. Scientists are trying to figure out ways of lowering cows' methane production. Some researchers say they have created a pill that could do that. Other researchers want to change cows' diets. Some scientists think cows should eat more natural sugar. Other researchers want to add extra fats from coconuts or sunflower seeds to cattle feed. That could make cows—and the planet—healthier!"	3
"Scientists recently found dried chilies in southern Mexico. Chilies are a type of spicy pepper used to flavor foods. The find proves that people liked spicy foods 1,500 years ago. This makes Mexican foods one of the oldest types of cuisine, or food. A total of 10 types of chilies were found. They were found in two caves near Mitla, Mexico. Scientist Linda Perry studied the chilies. She says they were found in good condition. Perry says the people probably used chilies in dishes such as salsas and stews. ""I think it's very possible that they were making similar things back then [to present-day Mexican food],"" Perry told WR News."	3
"Part of a volcano in Hawaii has rumbled to life! The Halemaumau Crater recently exploded for the first time in 84 years. Gravel rained down on nearby roads, causing officials to close off the area. The crater is part of the Kilauea volcano, which frequently erupts. The volcano is located on the big island of Hawaii. It is 4,190 feet tall. The explosion on the crater was the first one since 1924. There was no lava, or hot liquid rock. The explosion may have shaken up the people of Hawaii, but according to a new study, volcanoes may actually be good for the environment. Scientists recently compared two volcanoes that erupted years ago. One volcano is the Paricutin volcano in Mexico. It formed in 1943. When it erupted it smothered, or covered, the land. Farm life was destroyed, and people were forced to leave the area. It was a different story, though, in northern Arizona. There, scientists studied the Sunset Crater. It erupted about 1,000 years earlier than the Mexico volcano. The eruption left thin layers of volcanic material on the land. The area became more arable, or farmable, as a result. That is because the ash acted as a fertilizer, helping plants to grow. People were able to stay and farm the land successfully. ""Volcanoes provide all sorts of beneficial things to the earth,"" scientist Michael Ort told WR News."	3
Talk about going out for a spin! The cabin of this egg-shaped car can turn around in a circle! The little car's wheels can also turn so the car can drive sideways. The car is called Pivo 2. People can't buy Pivo 2 yet but may be able to someday. It is a model of a possible car of the future. It was one of more than 520 new cars on display at a recent car show in Tokyo, Japan. Japan is a country in Asia. Companies from 11 different countries showed off their latest cars. What else was big at the show? Little cars! Many car companies showed tiny cars that don't use much fuel. Hybrid cars were also a hit. Hybrid cars are cars powered by both gasoline and electricity.	3
"The ice-cream industry is buzzing, and the news isn't sweet. Here's the scoop: Honeybees are disappearing, and scientists are not sure why. That could be bad news for some foods, including ice cream. Bees pollinate many plants that grow ice-cream ingredients such as strawberries and almonds. To pollinate is to move pollen from one plant to another so the plants can make fruit and seeds. Pollen is a yellow powder. Without bees to pollinate the plants, some plants can't grow fruit. Ice-cream maker Haagen-Dazs is concerned about the missing bees. It uses bee-pollinated ingredients in nearly half its flavors. The company recently formed the Haagen-Dazs Loves Honey Bees campaign to raise money for honeybee research. ""It's beyond just us and the ice-cream industry,"" Haagen-Dazs spokesperson Diane McIntyre told WR News. ""Everyone likes their fruits and vegetables ... and they just wouldn't exist [without the honeybees]."""	3
"All ice-skaters should thank Finland. That is a country in Europe. Scientists recently discovered that people who lived in Finland in ancient, or long-ago, times were the first to create and use ice skates. They made the first ice skates about 5,000 years ago. Instead of metal blades, they used animal bones, including horse bones. Finland has many lakes that freeze during the winter. Scientists say those lakes form the highest concentration, or collection, of ice in the world. People in ancient times used the skates as a way to cross the frozen lakes. That cut down their travel time. ""Wherever people needed to travel, they would find at least one lake on their route,"" Federico Formenti, study coauthor, told WR News. ""In Finland, people [using ice skates] could save almost two hours [on their] journey."""	3
"No more cookies or candy for SpongeBob SquarePants. Dora the Explorer is also going on a diet. Recently, some companies decided to stop using cartoon characters to advertise unhealthy foods and drinks to children. This includes television commercials. Nickelodeon will stop showing characters on junk-food packages by 2009. Starting next year, Kellogg's, McDonald's, and Kraft Foods will not advertise unhealthy products to children under 12. According to doctors, kids see 40,000 television ads per year. About half of them are food ads. Many of them are for sugary cereals and unhealthy snacks. Health experts and parents say these ads make kids want to eat junk food more often. Eating too much junk food contributes, or adds, to childhood obesity. Obesity is the condition of being very overweight. Experts say one-third of American children are obese or at risk for becoming obese. Currently, there are no laws that control how food companies advertise to children. This means it's up to the companies to decide how to advertise. Josephine Thomas is a parent. She is glad that some companies are changing their use of cartoon characters in advertisements. ""As soon as [my kids] see a Shrek or Mickey Mouse [food product], they automatically look at that and they don't see what they really need,"" she says. Yes, according to scientists at the University of Liverpool in Europe. Recently, they studied 60 children of various weights. The kids, ages 9 to 11, were shown several food and toy ads on television. Children at a healthy weight ate 84 percent more food after watching the food commercials than after watching the toy commercials. Obese kids ate 134 percent more food."	3
"Get your LEGOs ready. It's time to build a cake—a birthday cake, that is. LEGO bricks are 50 years old! Ole Kirk Christiansen created the original, or first, connectable plastic bricks in Denmark in 1958. Denmark is a country in Europe. Today, there are more LEGOs on Earth than there are people. For each of the planet's 6.6 billion people, there are about 62 LEGO bricks. The company is celebrating by holding a building contest for kids. The contest will find the best young LEGO builders in 30 countries, including the United States. Those kids will take part in a special building event in Denmark. There's no telling what the kids' creations will look like. ""When you give someone a LEGO brick, the possibilities are endless,"" says SÃ¸ren Torp Laursen, president of LEGO Americas."	3
Hello! My name is Eileen Teh. I am 11 years old. I attend the International School of Wuxi in the Jiangsu Province of China. A province is an area. I have lived in China for about three years. I like my school, my friends, and my teachers. I can speak and write Chinese and English. I use both languages at school and at home. My family celebrates Chinese New Year (called Spring Festival here), Easter, and Christmas. I enjoy shopping and baking with my mother. We eat a lot of Italian and Korean food. I have visited Beijing twice. It's big and very crowded, but it's a good place for shopping. The Olympics are going to start there in August. I may not be able to attend the events, but my school is taking a field trip to Beijing soon.	3
"Tree climbers at Roy's Redwoods Open Space Preserve in California have a huge job! They are climbing redwoods more than 200 feet tall to snip cuttings from the trees' highest branches. Some arborists, or tree experts, say those cuttings may help preserve, or save, the trees. Redwoods are some of the tallest trees in the world. They can grow more than 300 feet tall and live for more than 2,000 years. However, many redwood forests have been cut down. Only 5 percent of forests with the oldest redwood trees are left. David Milarch of Champion Tree Project International wants to change that. He has launched a campaign to clone redwoods so new forests can be planted. To clone is to copy genetic material. Genetic material is information inside living creatures. It determines features, such as size and height. Milarch and his team want to clone the oldest, tallest redwoods. So far, the team has collected 900 cuttings from three redwoods in California. Arborists put them in a special nursery to grow. After a few years, the cuttings will be ready for planting. Some of those young trees will stay in California, but Milarch also wants to send the cloned trees all over the world. ""[The forests] can be a model for the world,"" he told WR News. ""We've made terrible mistakes by cutting down forests ... and we're going to go back and try to fix it."" Trees don't have diaries, but they do keep good records. Each ring in a tree's trunk represents a year of growth. The more rain that fell during the year, the wider the ring is."	3
"Are you hoping for a computer game this holiday season? How about one that can improve your math grade? Playing a certain game on a Nintendo DS can improve students' math skills, according to a recent study done in Scotland. Scotland is a country in Europe. The game is called Dr. Kawashima's More Brain Training. It is a series, or collection, of puzzles. It includes problem-solving challenges and memory tests. For 10 weeks, 30 students played the game. The children were ages 9 and 10. Derek P. Robertson planned the study. He says students performed better in math after playing the game. ""The children noticed there was a change in how they viewed themselves as learners,"" Robertson told WR News. ""They were [encouraged to do well]."""	3
"When Christopher Bain visits schools, he shows students his Army uniform. He also talks to them about the American flag and what it symbolizes, or represents. Bain is a veteran who lives in Williamsport, Pa. A veteran is a person who has served in the U.S. armed forces. November 11 is Veterans Day, a day when Americans honor veterans. There are almost 25 million U.S. veterans living today. Bain is just one of many veterans who visits with students. Now a new program is helping to connect more students with veterans like Bain. It is called Take a Veteran to School Day. The program was created by the History Channel. It encourages schools to invite veterans to speak to students of all ages. Representatives from the History Channel say it's important that students know veterans. One school to get on board with the program was Steven G. Schorr Elementary School in Las Vegas, Nev. That's where the Take a Veteran to School Day program was announced in May. Third graders met several veterans at the event. Jennifer Rowland is a teacher at the school. ""My students were really able to grasp the meaning and importance of Veterans Day by meeting an actual veteran,"" she told WR News. ""They loved trying on and touching an actual [military] helmet!"" Veterans get a lot out of the experience too. Bain served in the Iraq war. ""I tell [students] a little bit about my story,"" he told WR News. ""I wanted to serve my country so I can keep [Americans'] way of life and keep the freedoms that we have."" In 1968, Congress passed a law to move Veterans Day to the fourth Monday in October. The holiday was switched back to November 11 in 1978. Men and women are not the only military heroes—dogs can be veterans too! Dogs, such as German shepherds, began serving in the U.S. armed forces in the 1940s. Today they continue to assist soldiers. Military dogs patrol, or guard, areas and sniff out bombs and traps."	3
"The planet Mercury recently had a special visitor. It was a robot named Messenger. The flying robot was the first spacecraft to travel near the planet in more than 30 years. Messenger flew within 125 miles of Mercury's surface. The spacecraft took more than 1,200 photographs of the planet. Before, scientists had pictures of less than half of Mercury's surface. Messenger will pass the planet in October 2008 and again in September 2009. Then the robot will spend a year orbiting the planet. To orbit is to travel in a path around an object. Scientists hope studying Mercury will show how the planets formed. ""We really need better information on Mercury to make sure that our ideas on how the Earth and sister planets formed [are correct],"" says researcher Sean Solomon."	3
Super Bowl, here I come! My name is Claire Jordan, and I'm a student at Edu-Prize School in Gilbert, Ariz. I am going to report on the Super Bowl for WR News. The Super Bowl is the National Football League's championship game. The big game is on February 3 in Glendale, Ariz. I will interview players from both teams before the Super Bowl. I will ask them when they started playing football and what they like most about the sport. Then I'll watch the game live. I will sit with other reporters in a special section of the stadium. I am mostly looking forward to meeting some players and seeing a professional football game in person. I cannot wait for the Super Bowl!	3
"What do you get when you cross Mickey Mouse with Dumbo? A long-eared jerboa! The little critter is from Mongolia and China. Those are countries in Asia. The animal is not actually a mouse. It is a rodent with long legs and giant ears. Long-eared jerboas are endangered, or at risk of dying out completely. Scientists recently filmed video of the animals for the first time. ""The big ears make them look cute and comical,"" scientist Jonathan Baillie told WR News. Baillie is with the Zoological Society of London's EDGE of Existence program. The program works to conserve, or save, endangered animals. A team will study jerboas in an effort to save them. ""It is important to conserve the long-eared jerboa,"" Baillie says. ""If we lost [the animals] there would be nothing similar on the planet."""	3
"Although Zach Bonner sleeps in a warm bed every night, he has met many children who do not have places to live. ""They worry that their friends might find out they are homeless,"" Zach told WR News. Hearing their stories made Zach, 10, want to help. The Valrico, Fla., boy recently walked 280 miles in Florida. He walked from Tampa to Tallahassee to help homeless children. The walk lasted 24 days. Zach raised $25,000 in money and supplies. Experts estimate, or guess, that more than 1 million U.S. children are homeless. Kids might be homeless because of family problems. Some families have trouble earning enough money to pay for housing. Now people are taking notice. The U.S. Congress recently declared, or named, November as a month to recognize homeless children. Zach's walk helped spread Congress's message. On his journey, he met politicians and people working to help homeless kids. Zach walked 12 miles a day with his family and slept in a recreational vehicle at night. Now the miles are behind him, but Zach's work is not over. He has been visiting kids in homeless shelters to deliver the donations he collected during his walk. One former homeless person nicknamed ""Bear"" told Zach he was doing a great job. ""[Homeless kids] are real kids,"" Zach says. ""Just imagine how they could change the world if we all tried to help."" Volunteer at a shelter or soup kitchen with your family. Donate clothing and toys to homeless charities."	3
"Giant pandas in China could be in giant trouble! China is a country in Asia. The bears are having trouble finding bamboo. That is their favorite food. Almost all the bamboo in their habitat, or home, has died off. Bamboo plants go through a cycle of dying and regrowth. First the plants flower. Then they produce seeds before they die. They do that every few decades. The plants take 10 to 20 years to fully grow. Giant pandas usually move to new locations when their bamboo dies. But people have built buildings where pandas live. Sarah Janicke works for the World Wildlife Fund (WWF). That is an organization that helps wild animals. ""It's really hard for [giant pandas] to move from place to place now,"" she told WR News. To help the pandas, the WWF and the Chinese government are building pathways. They will connect wildlife areas so the animals can find their way to food."	3
"Would you like to live in the White House? For some kids, that dream might become a reality! Several candidates in the 2008 presidential election are parents. Five of the candidates have children under 10. Experts say that is a first in recent history. Many parents include their kids in their campaigns. A campaign is a series of activities during which candidates try to win votes. Emma Claire Edwards, 9, is traveling across the country with her family. Her father is Democrat John Edwards. He is running for president. Emma Claire says she loves being on the campaign trail. ""I get to go to fun places,"" she told WR News. Republican candidate Sam Brownback also had his kids with him at some events during the summer. Now they are home. ""The bad part about having a dad running for president is that he is not home a lot,"" Mark Brownback, 9, told WR News. ""The good part is that I think he is doing the right thing."""	3
"Next year is a presidential election year, and things are starting early! In November, Americans will elect a new president of the United States. Elect means to choose. November may seem far away, but it's not for presidential candidates. Those are people running to be elected president. Most of the candidates are part of one of two main political parties, or groups. The parties are the Democratic Party and the Republican Party. Members of the Democratic Party are called Democrats. Members of the Republican Party are called Republicans. January is an important time for both parties. That is when the first primaries and caucuses will begin. A primary is a statewide election. A caucus is a meeting among state party leaders and members. In both types of elections, voters choose candidates to represent their party. The first of those elections will be caucuses held in Iowa on January 3. ""The primary elections and caucuses are a very important part of our political process,"" Jack Barse of Kids Voting USA told WR News. A win means a candidate has a state's support at the party's national convention later in the year. At the conventions, each party will nominate one candidate. To nominate means to name a person for office. When WR News went to press, 16 major candidates were running for president. Of those, half are Democrats and half are Republicans. Would you like to become president of the United States one day? Hereâ€™s what it takes to land the top job in the White House."	3
"Talk about ideas that pop! Kids across the country recently entered the Bubble Wrap Competition for Young Inventors. They created inventions with Bubble Wrap. That is packing material. The semifinalists were announced, and the grand prize winner will be named during the week of January 28. Andy Boler, 9, is a semifinalist. He used Bubble Wrap to build a plant shelter, or covering, to protect plants. ""I like building things that help people,"" Andy told WR News. Sealed Air, the company that makes Bubble Wrap, sponsors the contest. The National Museum of Education organizes it. Spokesperson Nicholas Frankovits says the contest encourages kids to be creative. ""One of the main goals is to get young students thinking,"" he says."	3
"November is Military Family Month! To celebrate, kids around the country participated in a national art contest. The contest was organized by the Armed Services YMCA. It was for kids with parents who serve in the military. Pierce Condon of Mesa, Ariz., was one of the winners of the contest. Pierce is in the third grade. His father is a soldier in the military. Pierce drew a picture depicting, or showing, his family. In the picture they are standing under an American flag. ""I am proud of my military family because my grandpas were in the military, and now my dad is,"" Pierce told WR News. Military Family Month was created more than 10 years ago. Each November, people honor military families with ceremonies and events."	3
"Where did Abraham Lincoln live while he was president? The White House is only half the answer. Lincoln and his family also lived in a 34-room house 3 miles from the White House. The building, called President Lincoln's Cottage, will open to the public on February 19. When Lincoln didn't need to be at the White House, he stayed at the cottage. He worked on a draft of the Emancipation Proclamation while there, according to experts. That is the document Lincoln signed to free most U.S. slaves in 1863 during the Civil War (1861—1865). The cottage recently underwent an eight-year, $15 million renovation, or repair. Visitors to the cottage can tour the high-ceilinged rooms, view copies of books Lincoln read, and see a model of his desk. ""The White House has changed [since Lincoln lived there],"" Frank Milligan, director of the cottage, told WR News. ""This is the only place in the country where young people can come and see how he lived."""	3
"What would you rather be when you grow up the president of the United States or a pro football player? Former U.S. President Gerald Ford was a great football player. He got offers to play for two pro teams. He went to law school instead. You can learn what the presidents were like as kids at a museum exhibit in Washington, D.C. An exhibit is a show or display. This exhibit is called ""School House to White House."" It includes more than 150 items from U.S. presidents' school days. There are lots of pictures, letters, and report cards on display. U.S. President Jimmy Carter had perfect attendance. George W. Bush made straight A's in first grade. His father, George H. W. Bush, also grew up to be president. He once got an F in science!"	3
"It has been a not-so-great pumpkin season across the United States. High temperatures and lack of rain have decreased farmers' pumpkin crops. Tennessee is one of the top pumpkin-producing states. The temperature there often reached more than 100 degrees during the summer. The dry, hot weather also damaged pumpkin patches in other states including Maryland and Kentucky. Pumpkin plants must produce flowers, or blooms, so pumpkins can grow. ""The lack of rainfall makes it hard for plants such as pumpkins to produce blooms,"" George Killgore of the University of Tennessee told WR News. There is no need to cancel your Halloween plans, though. Some states will import pumpkins from other states. To import means to bring in from other places. After all, the Great Pumpkin never lets us down. Just ask Linus!"	3
"What is black, white, read all over ... and 12 feet tall? It's Newspaper House! That is a house made out of about 120,000 sheets of newspaper. An artist named Sumer Erek created the structure, or building, in London, England. England is a country in Europe. Erek built Newspaper House to remind people to recycle. Recycling is putting items through a special process so parts of the items can be used again. In the United States, people use more than 100 million tons of paper a year. About half of that amount is recycled to make new paper. To create Newspaper House, Erek built a wooden frame. Then he invited people from across London to donate, or give, their old newspapers to his project. ""Even things that don't have value can be ... something beautiful,"" Erek told reporters."	3
"Meet the world's cheapest car! It's the Nano, a mini auto that costs only $2,500. Most new cars cost more than $15,000. Tata Motors, a company in India, recently introduced the car at a local auto show. India is a country in Asia. The tiny, four-door Nano has a sloping, or slanted, roof. The car does not have a radio or an air conditioner. It can fit about five people if they squeeze in close together. The Nano also has better gas mileage than most cars—1 gallon lasts for about 50 miles. The Nano's affordable price means millions more people could own a car. An affordable car is one that is sold for a price that most people can pay. Some people, though, say more drivers will clog India's roads and increase air pollution in the country. Representatives for Tata Motors say the car will create less pollution than most motorcycles cause. ""I hope we can [give back] to the country,"" says the company's chairperson, Ratan Tata."	3
"A year ago, Khalil Colon, 9, said running made him feel like he was ""about to drop on the middle of the floor."" Today, running is a breeze for him. ""Now I can run 20 laps and I'm not even tired,"" he says. Khalil participates in the Mighty Milers program. That is a running program that helps kids become fit. His school in New York City is one of more than 100 schools in his state to take part in the program. Students run at least half a mile, several days a week. A mile is 5,280 feet. Students earn prizes and medals depending on how many miles they complete. The goal of Mighty Milers is to reduce childhood obesity. That is the condition of being very overweight. Mighty Milers challenges elementary school kids to run or walk up to four marathons during the school year. A marathon is a race that is 26.2 miles. That is more than 138,000 feet! Not exercising enough can lead to weight gain if a person takes in more calories than he or she burns. A calorie is a measure of the amount of energy in food. Being overweight can lead to health problems, such as heart disease. Program director Cliff Sperber says Mighty Milers is trying to improve children's health. ""Kids take pride in the fact that they're running,"" he told WR News. The young runners agree. Just ask Katherine Rojas, 9. She is the fastest runner in her class in New York City. ""[Running] makes me feel good about myself,"" she says. ""And it helps you get muscles."" Running may be an individual sport, but itâ€™s a team effort for the leg muscles. Study the diagram to learn which lower-body muscles runners rely on to propel, or push, them forward. Most of the leg muscles push the leg forward. When the foot pushes off the ground, the lower leg creates energy so runners can run fast."	3
"An old-fashioned ship is traveling the world to share an important story. The ship is called the Amistad. It is a reproduction, or copy, of the original Amistad. In 1839, a group of Africans was forced aboard the original ship. The Africans had been kidnapped and sold into slavery. Their owners were taking them to work on an island in the Caribbean Sea. However, the Africans rebelled and took control of the ship. To rebel is to fight back. The Africans wanted to return home. They tried to steer the ship back to Sierra Leone. That is a country in Africa. They ended up in the United States instead. After a long court trial, the Africans were finally allowed to return to Sierra Leone in January 1842. Recently, the modern, or new, Amistad arrived in Sierra Leone. The crew is on a yearlong mission to honor the brave Africans who dared to rebel. The ship began its journey in New Haven, Conn. That is where the Africans had landed. On its way to Africa, the new Amistad visited Europe. The ship will return to the United States this spring. It will stop in five U.S. cities. The tour will end in New Haven. At each stop, crew members teach children about slavery. Dwayne Williams belongs to Amistad America, the group that organized the trip. ""We are a small ship that has a big story to tell,"" he told WR News. The most famous person aboard the Amistad was Joseph Cinque (SING-kay). He led the rebellion on the ship. Cinque used a nail to unlock the other Africans' chains. Then he ordered the captain of the ship to sail back to Africa. At night, though, the captain secretly steered the ship the wrong way. That is how the Amistad ended up in the United States. The Africans were put on trial in the United States. Some people thought they should not have rebelled. However, the U.S. Supreme Court justices ruled that the Africans could go home. They returned to Africa in 1842."	3
"Eagles and flamingos are invading Fernbank Elementary School in Decatur, Ga.! The animals are the names of some of the yoga poses students practice. Yoga is exercise that involves holding poses while breathing. Students at the school have done yoga for more than two years. Teachers say it helps improve students' concentration and confidence. Teacher Janet Watson says yoga also helps her students deal with stress during tests. ""In between the different sections [of tests], we have them get up and do the [yoga] stretches,"" she told WR News. ""It helps create less stress."" Joshua, a third grader, likes the flamingo pose best. The move involves bending forward while extending one leg straight back. ""I love yoga because it is a very nice thing to do after working hard at school,"" Joshua told WR News."	3
"With the help of a special camera, scientists recently met unusual creatures. They saw a squid with crooked eyes. They also met the scary-looking viperfish. It has teeth like ice picks! Scientists uncovered hundreds of underwater species. A species is a type of plant or animal. The discoveries were made in the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. That is a submerged, or underwater, mountain range. It is beneath the Atlantic Ocean. The Mid-Atlantic Ridge has not been explored much. Scientists often search waters closer to land. The scientists sent vehicles into the water. The vehicles searched waters up to two miles deep. They included cameras that took pictures of the animals. The cameras found that the ridge has a high level of biodiversity, or variety of plants and animals in an environment. The team may have found a new species of ostracod, says lead scientist Monty Priede. An ostracod is a shrimplike animal. ""Usually you do not realize it is a new species until some time later,"" Priede, a science professor from Europe, told WR News. The Mid-Atlantic Ridge still holds secrets to be uncovered. ""The main thing we want to find out is what lives out there and in what quantity,"" Priede says. Scientists uncovered hundreds of rarely seen underwater critters in the Atlantic Ocean. Many of them have unusual features. Read below to learn more about some of the species. The jewel squid was discovered between 656 and 1,640 feet deep. Its lopsided eyes help it keep watch for predators, animals that feed on other animals. The viperfish was found about 1,300 to 1,600 feet deep. Watch out! This fish has fang-like teeth. The ostracods were spotted at about 10,559 feet, or 2 miles, deep. To see in the dark water, the tiny creatures have huge eyes."	3
"A park in India is full of surprises—tiger cubs! India is a country in Asia. At least 10 Bengal tiger cubs have been born in the past two years at Ranthambhore (RAN-tham-bore) National Park in India. They may be the start of Bengal tigers' roaring comeback. Today, there are fewer than 1,500 Bengal tigers in India, according to the Wildlife Institute of India. Poachers target the cats for their striped fur. Poachers are people who hunt illegally. India's growing human population is also putting tigers at risk. The country has the world's secondlargest population. About 1.1 billion people live there. Growing cities are shrinking tigers' habitats, or homes. That's a big problem. Tigers like to hunt alone, so they need plenty of room to prowl. U.S. officials recently met with Indian leaders to find a way to save the tigers. Stronger security has helped police find and arrest more than 50 poachers in two parks over the past three years. Officials have also limited the number of safari trucks that bring tourists through Ranthambhore. They hope the new rules will protect the tigers. Wildlife groups say India's Bengal tigers can thrive, or succeed, with help. Eric Dinerstein of the World Wildlife Fund told WR News, ""Wherever we protect tigers and their habitats, tigers come roaring back."" People: India has one of the oldest civilizations, or communities, in the world. Experts trace the Indus Valley Civilization back at least 4,500 years. Religion: Four world religions originated, or began, in India. They include: Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism, and Sikhism. Taj Mahal: This building is one of India's famous landmarks. It is a tomb, or burial place, to honor the favorite wife of the emperor Shah Jahan. The Himalayas: The world's tallest mountain system rises along India's northern border. The mountains stretch across southern Asia."	3
"Divers off the coast of Alaska recently discovered a sunken treasure. It is a ship called the Torrent. It sank in 1868. It is the oldest shipwreck ever discovered in Alaska. It was found near Port Graham. ""It's an extraordinary find,"" says Steve Lloyd. He led the team of divers. Extraordinary means very special. So far, the divers have uncovered two anchors, cannons, plates, shoes, and even an old toilet! Lloyd hopes the items will be placed in a museum. The Torrent sank after it crashed into a reef. A reef is a ridge of rock in the water. All 130 U.S. soldiers on board survived. They were on their way to Alaska to build the first U.S. fort there. The United States had purchased Alaska from Russia less than a year earlier. (Alaska did not become a state until 1959.) Lloyd says the ship is an important part of Alaska's history. ""[Its] story needs to be told."""	3
In a race between a Tyrannosaurus rex and a cheetah, who would win? The fast cat would speed past the T. rex. That's according to a new study. Scientists recently used a computer model to learn the average, or usual, speed of the huge dinosaur. The T. rex moved at an average speed of 15 miles per hour (mph). Some pro football players can run that fast! The scientists studied the dinosaur's weight, height, and bones. That information helped them figure out how the creature moved. They also used information from dinosaur fossils. Fossils are the remains of plants or animals. The study included other dinosaurs too. A small two-legged creature was the fastest dinosaur. It moved at about 40 mph.	3
"It's a bird, it's a plane, it's a ... tiny flying reptile? Scientists recently discovered the fossil of a sparrow-sized creature in China. A reptile is an animal that crawls or slithers, has scales or bony plates, and lays eggs. The fossil is a pterosaur (TER-uh-sor). Pterosaurs were flying reptiles that had wings made of skin. It was also a pterodactyl (ter-uh-DAK-tuhl). A pterodactyl is an extinct type of pterosaur that lived millions of years ago. To be extinct means to have died out completely. The reptile is named Nemicolopterus crypticus (nem-i-coh-LOP-ter-uss CRIP-ti-cuss). It is little, but it may set a big record. Scientists say it is the smallest toothless pterosaur ever found! Nemicolopterus had a 9.8-inch wingspan. A wingspan is the distance from the tip of one wing to the tip of the other. The reptile also had a sharp, pointy beak and curved, birdlike claws. The reptile's small size may have had advantages. Scientists say being small may have allowed Nemicolopterus to hide from animals that eat other animals. Its size may have also helped it find food. Because it was small, the reptile could ""be [quicker] to catch insects,"" scientist Xiaolin Wang told WR News. Wang was on the team that discovered the pterosaur. Scientists plan to study the reptile's fossil in more detail. They hope it will offer clues about how pterosaurs changed over time. ""They are ancestors of the large pterosaurs,"" Wang says. Pterosaurs ranged in size from as small as a bird to as big as an airplane. Here are three different kinds of pterosaurs. Dimorphodon: This pterosaur's wingspan was about 4 feet. It also had a huge head, and its legs could stretch out. Pteranodon: This pterosaur was about 6 feet long with a wingspan of 20 to 25 feet. Pteranodon weighed about 25 pounds. Quetzalcoatlus: This is the largest pterosaur ever found. Its wingspan was about 40 feet. It also had a long, thin beak."	3
"He can scale, or climb, tall buildings and sling webs stronger than steel. Now Spider-Man has another special power—he can deliver the U.S. mail. The U.S. Postal Service recently made Spidey his own 41-cent stamp. (Now that's a stamp with stick!) Spidey's stamp is part of a 20-stamp set of Marvel Comics superheroes. Other characters include Captain America and Spider-Woman. The stamps are a ""great honor,"" says Dan Buckley of Marvel Entertainment. He says the stamps prove that superheroes are a part of American life."	3
Hi! My name is Kenneth-John Putulik. I live in a town called Chesterfield Inlet in Canada. I go to Victor Sammurtok School. In the winter, we get lots of snow. We stay warm by wearing handmade clothing, including sealskin mitts. We also wear handmade kamiks, or boots. Kamiks are made from caribou skin or sealskin. A caribou is a type of reindeer. We get our food from hunting. We collect berries and freshwater from the lakes. We get outdoor clothing and meat for food from animals we catch. We eat caribou, seal, walrus, fish, and whale. We also eat store-bought food. I love where I live because our community is small. We live and grow up together as one big family.	3
Attention, Barbie and Elmo: It's time to muscle up! The U.S. Congress is considering a bill to strengthen toy safety laws. Millions of toys were recalled last year in the United States. To recall is to ask people to return something they already bought. Sixty-one different types of toys were recalled last year. Some toys were made with poisonous lead paint. Others had breakable parts that could be swallowed accidentally. The toys were produced, or made, in China for U.S. companies. China is a country in Asia. The new laws would reduce the amount of lead allowed in toys. There would also be more safety tests for toys.	3
"Scientists are hot on the trail of Native Americans! They are using a high-tech machine to learn how the people traded goods with one another. The scientists are using the machine to study Native American arrowheads and other stone tools. What makes the scientists' work so special is that the machine does not harm the objects. In the past, scientists had to drill holes or take samples from artifacts. Artifacts are objects made by people in the past. The machine can tell the scientists what the objects are made of. That can help them learn where the rocks used to make the tools came from. For example, the scientists figured out that tools found in Alaska were made from rocks 300 miles away. Scientists hope to use the machine to learn more about other ancient cultures. Herb Maschner is one of the scientists leading the research. ""Understanding how cultures [worked together] is key to learning about [their] rise,"" he told WR News."	3
"Students at Skyline Vista Elementary School don't have a class pet. But they do have a favorite reptile—the western painted turtle! A reptile is an animal that lays eggs. Reptiles are cold-blooded. That means their body temperature depends on their environment. The students, from Denver, Colo., are trying to make the turtle Colorado's state reptile. They recently met with lawmakers to explain why. ""We should have a state reptile that's colorful like Colorado,"" Horacio Duerte Bernal, 10, told WR News. The turtle has red and yellow stripes on most of its body. Horacio and the students are eager to find out whether the law will pass. They'll have to wait, though. The process is slow—just as a turtle is!"	3
Scientists recently discovered the tusks and bones of a mastodon in Milia, Greece. The mastodon was an early kind of hairy elephant. Mastodons became extinct in Europe about 2 million years ago. Extinct means having died out completely. The tusks are the largest of their kind ever found. They are 15 and 16 feet long! Scientists also uncovered the animal's leg and parts of its jaw. Many of the bones were in good condition. The jaw still had teeth. Scientists hope to study the tusks and bones to better understand the mastodon. They also hope to learn more about the time the animal roamed.	3
"Courtney Oliver doesn't just take her family's dogs to the veterinarian—she helps treat them! A veterinarian is a doctor for animals. The 10-year-old from Olympia, Wash., recently became a certified veterinary assistant. That is a person who is trained to help veterinarians. Courtney learned how to care for animals by taking online college classes. Most people who take those classes are adults. She studied everything about animals—even their teeth. Now Courtney helps out at South Bay Veterinary Hospital one day a week. She puts bandages on cuts and gives shots. She also does laundry and cleans the floors and pet crates. Courtney wants to be a veterinarian when she grows up. ""I'm a huge animal lover, and it's fun to take care of them,"" she told WR News."	3
"Move over, Spider-Man! Spiders in Lake Tawakoni State Park in Texas have spun a web—a big one. It is the size of two football fields. The net covers several trees. It is so thick in some parts that it blocks out the sunlight. Entomologists have found about 12 species of spiders in the web. An entomologist is a person who studies insects. The scientists think that two types of spiders built most of the web. Entomologist Allen Dean says working together is unusual for spiders. He says they usually eat one another. ""The spiders can live [in the web together] because there's so much food available,"" he told WR News."	3
The Great Lakes have a great big problem. They’re under attack! Odd creatures from faraway places are moving in and taking over. Those creatures are invasive species. Invasive species are animals or plants that get moved to a new place and harm the people, animals, or plants that live there. Zebra mussels in the Great Lakes block pipes that people depend on for water. Sea lampreys kill the lakes’ fish. Those and other invasive species are putting the area’s 3,500 types of native plants and animals in danger. Something that is native has always lived in that part of the world. Even more trouble is on the way, scientists say. U.S. researchers recently found 28 species in the lakes that could become destructive, or harmful. That worries scientist Vic Serveiss, who helped with the research. “Invasive species ... compete for the same food ... as the native species,” he told WR News. “Many times [they] are more successful ... than the native species.” Some invasive species enter the lakes on ships from other places. Some ships carry water in tanks for balance. That water is called ballast water. When the ships arrive at the Great Lakes, they dump the ballast water. Any species in that water end up in the lakes. It’s important to stop new invasive species from entering, says Tim Eder of the Great Lakes Commission. That group helps protect the lakes. “We’re trying to get Congress to pass new laws to require ships ... to clean [their] tanks before they release water into the lakes,” he says.	3
Rain Forest Life: More than 30 million people live in the Amazon region, or area. About 350 groups are originally from the region. The residents depend on the forest for food and shelter. Wild World: The Amazon is home to more than 1,500 species of birds, about 3,000 species of fish, and about 30 million insect species! The howler monkey is one of the animals that live there. Tall, Tall Trees: Rubber trees and emergents are trees in the Amazon. Emergents tower above the rest of the forest. They reach heights of more than 165 feet. That is about as tall as a 12-story building! Tasty Treats: Hungry? Lemons, coffee beans, pineapples, oranges, vanilla, chocolate, and sugarcane are some of the many foods and spices grown in the Amazon. Tropical Cures: The Amazon rain forest is full of natural healers. White trillium flowers cure snakebites. Coca plants treat headaches, and castor beans soothe sunburned skin.	3
This discovery will knock your socks off! Scientists recently found footprints that are more than a million years old. The footprints are in Kenya. That is a country in Africa. An early human ancestor, or relative from the past, may have made the prints. The feet that made the prints had rounded heels and big toes that point forward, just like people have today. U.S. scientist John Harris helped discover the special prints. He and his team found four sets of adult footprints in the area. They also found tracks of animals such as lions. The footprints could teach people a lot about what Earth was like a million years ago. Figuring that out is “like a giant jigsaw puzzle,” Harris told reporters.	3
Drop that cheeseburger! Many restaurant kids’ meals are unhealthy, according to one health group. It reviewed, or studied, meals that are made especially for children at 13 major restaurant chains. The restaurants include McDonald’s and Burger King. Researchers found that about 93 percent of kids’ meals at the restaurants have too many calories. A calorie is a measure of the amount of energy in food. You burn calories when you do activities such as running. If a person takes in more calories than he or she burns, it can lead to weight gain. Gaining too many pounds can make a person obese, or very overweight. According to the Institute of Medicine, children ages 4 to 8 should eat about 430 calories per meal. However, researchers found that some of the restaurant meals have more than 1,000 calories. That’s more than double the suggested amount! Researcher Margo Wootan helped study the kids’ meals. She says some of the restaurants’ unhealthy foods make it hard for families to eat right. “Parents want to feed their children healthy meals,” she says. Some major restaurants are working to lighten up. In New York, a law was passed that requires restaurants to list foods’ calories on menus. Other restaurants are offering fruit and yogurt instead of fries. That will help kids make better choices. Rebeca Torres is a parent in Los Angeles. She tries hard to feed her kids healthy foods when they dine out. “[Restaurants] should have better things for children,” she says.	3
Holy cow! Some kids are trading in hamburgers for foods that don’t have meat. About 367,000 children in the United States are vegetarians, according to a recent study. A vegetarian is a person who does not eat meat. That includes beef, pork, chicken, and fish. Researchers talked to thousands of parents about their kids’ diets. Some families think it’s healthier to eat more fruits and veggies instead of meat. Other young vegetarians don’t want to eat meat because it comes from animals. Some health experts, though, are worried about children being vegetarians. They say kids might not get all the vitamins their growing bodies need. Meat provides iron and protein. Others think young people can be healthy without meat. Food scientist Amy Lanou says kids should eat many different types of healthy meals. “Look for a variety of whole, colorful foods,” Lanou told WR News. “They will help you get all the nutrients you need.”	3
Do your pets fight like cats and dogs? You may be surprised to learn that these animals are often furry friends. The team surveyed 170 households. To survey is to collect information. All of the households had a dog and a cat as pets. More than half of the pet owners reported that their pets seem to get along. Experts say the animals are more likely to get along if they meet when they are young. “This is good news for people who would like to keep both a cat and a dog,” researcher Joseph Terkel told WR News. Garfield and Odie must have missed the message!	3
High in the sky, a flock of birds flies south. The birds are whooping cranes. At about 5 feet tall, they are the tallest birds in North America. The wild animals appear to be following larger birds. But those are not birds at all. They are people flying three-wheeled aircraft called trikes. The pilots are wearing white helmets and gowns. That might sound like a birdbrained idea, but it’s not. The pilots are from an organization called Operation Migration. They are helping the whooping cranes learn to migrate. To migrate is to move from one area to another when the seasons change. Whooping cranes are endangered. There are only about 380 of them in the United States. In the fall, whooping cranes in the North are supposed to migrate south for the winter. However, many whooping cranes don’t know how. With so few birds, many baby whooping cranes don’t have any adults to teach them how to migrate, explains Joe Duff. He is an Operation Migration pilot. That’s where the trikes and costumes come in. Each October, pilots in Wisconsin dress up like whooping cranes and take to the skies. The young birds follow them because they think the trikes are whooping cranes leading the flock. It takes about three months for the birds to reach the South—with plenty of stops along the way. The pilots lead the whooping cranes to special refuges, or protected areas, in Florida. By then, the birds know how to migrate. This spring, birds that flew with the pilots last fall will return to the North on their own. For Duff, the best part of the trip is bringing whooping cranes to the refuges. “It’s [a nice feeling] because you know the birds are going to make it,” he told WR News. Last fall, pilots in Wisconsin led a flock of whooping cranes across seven states. In Florida, the flock was divided and taken to two refuges. Study the map for a bird’s-eye view of their trip. Do you think it’s important to protect endangered animals? Why or why not?	3
A team of experts recently figured out that baby birds babble before they learn how to sing. To babble is to make sounds that have no meaning. Human babies babble while learning to talk. Researchers studied the bird brains of baby zebra finches as the little animals learned how to sing. According to zebra finch experts, the baby birds begin making noises about three days after being born. The soft noises are ff ff sounds, experts say. The colorful baby birdies practice making sounds constantly, or nonstop, according to Fee. His team also learned that one part of the zebra finch brain controls the baby babble. Another part of the brain controls the song the birds will sing as adults. Birds use songs to draw other birds toward them. Now scientists know why they’re so good at it—practice makes perfect.	3
Talk about an eye-popping discovery! Scientists recently found the mummy of a woman buried in Lima, Peru. That is a country in South America. Scientists say the 1,300-year-old mummy belonged to the Wari people. They lived in what is now Peru. The tomb is the most Pottery and textiles, or woven fabrics, surrounded the mummy. She also wore a detailed mask with bulging blue eyes. Scientists say the mummy and her tomb will help them learn more about the Wari people. The find will also shed some light on Lima. “This [helps us understand] Lima’s story,” head scientist Isabel Flores told reporters.	3
In Born to Read, a boy named Sam can’t get enough of books. Marc Brown, who drew the story’s pictures, feels the same way! Brown created the series about Arthur the aardvark. WR News student reporter Caitlin Bowen interviewed Brown about his job. Caitlin Bowen: What inspired you to write books? Marc Brown: I think it was growing up with a great-grandmother and a grandmother who told wonderful stories whenever we wanted them. ... My grandmother would tell spooky stories, and she would take out her false teeth [while she told them]. CB: What is it like to illustrate, or draw pictures, for someone else’s book? MB: It’s like getting a gift at a holiday—opening up this box and there inside is this wonderful story. CB: How do the Arthur books help kids? MB: [I take] things that maybe kids are struggling with, [such as] a bully at school ... and try to make it a fun story. But [I also try to] make it be a way for them to learn something.	3
You might think twice the next time you spot a fly on the wall! The U.S. Air Force plans to design flying robots that look like insects. The buggy robots could spy on enemies in other countries. They could also take part in missions that are too dangerous for humans. The flying machines could be as small as bumblebees, say military experts. They would also have wings that move up and down, just like real winged bugs. The bug-like robots may be able to fly undetected into buildings. Something that is undetected is not noticed. “If we know there’s a possibility of bad guys in a certain building, how do we find out?” asks project researcher Greg Parker. “We think this would [help us figure that out].” The robots could also help U.S. soldiers by taking photographs and recording enemies’ voices. They could even fire tiny weapons! Builders hope the robots take flight by 2030.	3
Dig this! Archaeologists are preparing to dig up an ancient, or very old, wooden boat in Egypt. An archaeologist is a scientist who digs up old objects and studies them to learn about the past. Egypt is a country in Africa. The boat is 4,500 years old. It is buried next to the Great Pyramid. That is the largest pyramid in Egypt. Egyptians built the Pyramids thousands of years ago. They are burial places for pharaohs, or kings. The boat is the second one found near the Great Pyramid. Archaeologists dug up the first boat in 1954. It is on display in a museum near the Pyramids. Experts will begin removing the buried boat this fall to study it. They hope to learn how the Egyptians used the boats.	3
Buzz Lightyear is living his wildest dreams. The Disney toy has finally gone “to infinity, and beyond!” Buzz is staying at the International Space Station. He rocketed his way to the station aboard the shuttle Discovery this spring. The Discovery crew delivered a new piece of the station. The piece is the size of a school bus. It will be the station’s biggest laboratory. That is a place where people do experiments. Buzz will stay at the space station until November. Astronauts hope that his visit will make kids want to learn about math and science. While Buzz is at the station, astronauts will be testing how toys work in space. You can learn about and watch the experiments by playing Mission Game 5 at www.nasa.gov/externalflash/Buzz_Lightyear/web.	3
Who kisses babies, flies coast to coast, and toots his or her own horn? A candidate for president, of course! A candidate is a person who runs for office. And there’s no bigger office than that of the president of the United States. Americans elect, or choose, a president every four years. The main presidential candidates for this election are John McCain and Barack Obama. They both want to become the next president. McCain is a senator from Arizona. He is a member of the Republican Party. That is one of the two major political parties in the country. A political party is group of people who share similar beliefs. Obama is a senator from Illinois. He is a member of the Democratic Party. That is the other major U.S. political party. Americans are eager to learn about the candidates. They want to know what McCain and Obama will do about problems, such as high food and gas prices. McCain and Obama will spend the next two months campaigning. That means they will hold events to win votes. Both candidates will give speeches about their ideas. They will also meet with people across the country. “They’re trying to reach different kinds of voters in different states,” political expert Kenneth Bickers told WR News. “They use lots of different tools to try to reach people.” On November 4, the candidates will find out who did a better job campaigning. That day is Election Day, when Americans vote for president. Campaigning for president is a full-time job. Here are some of the ways McCain and Obama will try to win votes this fall. McCain and Obama star in television and print ads. The ads could sway voters to elect them. Candidates travel coast to coast making speeches about important issues. They also meet with leaders in other countries. McCain and Obama reach millions of voters through Web sites. The Internet lets them share their ideas quickly.	3
No matter how much Jay Friedland drives his car, he never has to buy gas. Instead, the California resident plugs his Toyota RAV4 EV in to a regular electrical outlet in his garage each night. By morning, the vehicle is recharged and ready to roll. Friedland owns a plug-in car. That is a car that runs on electricity. There are two kinds of plug-in cars. All-electric cars, such as Friedland’s, run entirely on electricity. Others are called plug-in hybrids. Those cars are powered by both gasoline and electricity. (See “Plug It In.”) There aren’t many plug-in vehicles today. However, nine auto companies recently announced plans to build plug-in cars by 2013. The Chevrolet Volt will zoom onto the scene in 2010. The U.S.-made vehicle is a plug-in hybrid. It will be able to travel up to 40 miles on electricity. Then the car will use its gas engine to keep running. The Asian car company Mitsubishi also plans to sell its plug-in vehicle by late 2010. The i MiEV is an all-electric vehicle. Plug-in cars use less gas than regular cars. Some vehicles, such as all-electric cars, use no gas at all. Plug-in cars release less harmful materials into Earth’s atmosphere. Those materials include carbon dioxide. That is a gas that can harm the planet by making it warmer. Helping the environment is one reason Friedland drives a plug-in car. He is the director of Plug In America. That is a group that encourages people to drive plug-in vehicles to help the environment. “It’s incredibly fun to drive on electricity,” he told WR News. “And it’s great to know that every time you’re driving, you’re not hurting the Earth.” How does a plug-in car zoom to life? Take a peek under the hood of this plug-in hybrid to find out. (3) Electric Motor The electric motor supplies the car’s power. It makes the car run.	3
Nobody likes to get a teasing e-mail. Especially if you don’t know whom the mean message is from. Teasing or bothering other kids online is called cyberbullying. Experts say it’s a growing problem. A recent survey of 1,500 students found that one in every four kids had been bullied online more than once. In person, bullies can bother other kids only when adults aren’t watching. Cyberbullies can go after kids anytime. Some send hurtful e-mails. Others might use classmates’ passwords to log in to their computer game accounts. Then they steal their points. “[Victims] can’t get away from [the bullying],” Parry Aftab told WR News. Aftab is the founder of a Web site that helps people who have been mistreated online. “[The bullying] follows them to camp. It follows them to the mall. It’s where they are.” To protect kids, some companies are introducing software products to monitor, or watch, their Internet use. A group of teens from around the world also wants to stop online bullying. The teens are researching ways unknown bullies can be identified, or named. Aftab says kids also should be aware of their own behavior online. They should try not to hurt other people’s feelings. She says, “Don’t [say] anything online that you wouldn’t [say] off-line.” Are you being teased by a cyberbully? Here’s what to do if someone is bothering you online:	3
What will millions of Americans do on November 4? They will vote for the next president, of course! Most will choose either John McCain or Barack Obama. McCain is a Republican. Obama is a Democrat. The candidates and their running mates want the country’s top job. A running mate is a candidate for vice president. If McCain wins, Sarah Palin, the governor of Alaska, will be vice president. If Obama wins, Joe Biden, a senator from Delaware, will be vice president. This is a historic, or important, election. Obama could become the first African American president. Palin could become the first female vice president. The race will be close. Recent studies show that voters are more interested in this election outcome than they have been in the past five presidential elections. An outcome is an ending. Experts say more voters, including young people, will vote than ever before. Researcher Scott Keeter says young voters care about issues such as the economy. “Voters under 30 are going to play a very large role in the [election’s] outcome,” he told WR News. The country is ready to head to the polls, but many people haven’t decided whom to vote for. One of every four voters is undecided. McCain and Obama have been campaigning across the country, trying to win those votes. “The election could be very close,” political science professor Andrew Gelman told WR News. “If [the candidates] can swing a few thousand votes, that can make a difference between winning and losing.” A new president also means new children in the White House. Read to learn about John McCain’s and Barack Obama’s kids. Bridget McCain is McCain’s youngest child. The McCains adopted her when she was a baby. Bridget, 17, likes music, movies, and learning to drive. Malia and Sasha Obama could be the youngest kids in the White House since 1977. The Obama girls are ages 10 and 7. They like ice cream and the Jonas Brothers.	3
What do you get when you combine a bull’s horns, T. rex’s arms, and a shark’s teeth? South America’s scariest meat eater! It is called Carnotaurus sastrei (kahr-noh-TAWR-uhss SASS-tree-ee). Carnotaurus was 25 feet long. The dino lived about 115 million years ago. Paleontologists recently uncovered fossils, or remains, of what might have been a Carnotaurus. A paleontologist is a scientist who studies fossils. The bones, found in Brazil, may be only the second set of Carnotaurus fossils ever discovered. Brazil is a country in South America. The tough dino lived about 115 million years ago. Its name means “flesh-eating bull.” Carnotaurus had teeth like knives and a thick, powerful neck. Scientists say the dinosaur most likely ruled at the top of the food chain. The 25-foot-long dinosaur was a type of abelisaur (ah-BEL-ih-sawr). Abelisaurs were large meat eaters. They roamed what is now South America during the Cretaceous (krih-TAY-shuhss) Period. That period lasted from 144 million to 65 million years ago. Carnotaurus’s big horns helped it stand out among other abelisaurs. Its horns were 5 to 6 inches long. Studying Carnotaurus has not been easy. The only other Carnotaurus was found in 1984, in southern Argentina. That is a country in South America. Paleontologists say the fossils can do more than tell people about Carnotaurus. “[Fossils] tell us a lot about life on our planet,” Norell says. Carnotaurus ruled in South America, but other dinos were the boss up north. Here’s a look at some of North America’s dinosaurs during the late Cretaceous Period. Albertosaurus (al-ber-toh-SAWR-uhss) This giant meat eater was 30 feet long and weighed more than 6,000 pounds. It had huge sawlike teeth. Tyrannosaurus (tuh-ra-nuh-SAWR-uhss) This dino was the largest dinosaur in North America. It could kill almost any animal in its path. Gorgosaurus (gohr-go-SAWR-uhss) Gorgosauruses might have hunted in packs. Paleontologists have found more than 20 skeletons of this dino. What else might scientists want to know about Carnotaurus? Why?	3
Where do tyrannosaurs tango? On the dino dance floor! Scientists recently found more than 1,000 holes that may be dinosaur footprints. The holes are in Arizona. Scientists call the area the dino dance floor because the site is so packed with dino footprints that scientists imagined dinosaurs boogied there. Researchers say dinos probably went there for water. The site might have been an oasis. That is a spot in a desert where plants and water can be found. Still, some people aren’t sure that dinosaurs made the holes. Scientist Marjorie Chan will do more research to find out what caused them. “Our science is a ... search to understand ... our Earth,” she says.	3
Researchers have learned that dogs can “catch” yawns from humans. A recent study found that pups often yawn after In the study, a human researcher yawned in front of 29 dogs. Most of the pooches yawned back. Until this study, scientists thought people could make only other people and chimpanzees yawn. Experts say the results are a sign that dogs can feel empathy. That is the ability to understand how someone feels, such as bored or sleepy. “Dogs are amazingly good at reading humans’ signals,” researcher Atsushi Senju told WR News. “Our study suggests that dogs might even catch our feelings.”	3
If you think your dog’s hard to train, then you haven’t met Marley. The puppy turns into a full-grown problem in the new I met with animal trainer Mathilde de Cagny. She trained several dogs to play Marley in the film. The main one was an American Labrador named Clyde. One of the biggest challenges was to train Clyde to act untrained, says de Cagny. The dog was even taught to rip up cushions! “He was always encouraged to do anything he wanted to do,” she says. To encourage is to cheer on. The trick to being a great dog trainer is knowing when to quit, de Cagny says. Dogs, like us, need breaks. They should also be rewarded.	3
What would happen if your favorite book characters came to life? First Lady Laura Bush and her daughter Jenna recently wrote a book about just that. It’s called Read All About It! Caitlin Bowen, WR News student reporter, interviewed Laura Bush at the White House. They talked about one of the first lady’s favorite hobbies—reading! Caitlin Bowen: What was it like to write a book with your daughter Jenna? Laura Bush: We had a really good time writing a book together. The book is based on stories that we used to tell each other [about what it’s like to be a teacher]. CB: Who is your favorite author that you’ve gotten to meet? LB: Oh, I’ve gotten to meet so many authors, which has been really fun for me, because I’m a librarian. ... R. L. Stine is one. [He] wrote the Goosebumps books. His books ... a lot of times [will] be the first chapter book that boys read. CB: Who inspired, or encouraged, you? LB: My mother, of course, was the very first. She was the one who taught me to love to read. ... And my mother-in-law, Barbara Bush, who’s been a first lady herself. ... But many, many authors also serve as role models for me.	3
When Maeve Conway goes to gym class, the third grader from Portland, Ore., has many choices. First, Conway, 8, warms up by skipping to music. Then, she decides how to spend the rest of the period. Juggling? Rope swinging? Dancing? The activities are part of gym class at Llewellyn Elementary School. The unique, or unusual, games are part of a new program in Oregon schools to help kids exercise more. Some school officials say traditional, or common, sports like kickball do not allow kids to be very active. Kids might spend more time waiting for a turn than actually playing. Shy kids may also worry about having to take their turns in front of their classmates. To make gym class active and fun for all, teachers in Oregon and other states are introducing new activities. One activity some schools offer is hiking. The sport helps kids practice walking on uneven terrain, or land. Another activity, geocaching, is an outdoor treasure hunt. Kids can learn to follow clues and exercise at the same time. The activities focus on building skills and confidence. To have confidence is to believe in yourself. Officials also want kids to exercise so they are less likely to become overweight or obese. Lynette Zuercher is one of the gym program organizers in Portland. “We want to make sure kids understand there [are] a whole bunch of ways they can move,” she told WR News. Tate Calem (center) warms up for gym class. Maeve Conway (left) likes to dance to music. Gym class is more than fun. It also helps burn calories. A calorie is the measure of the amount of energy in food. People burn calories when they do activities such as walking. Check out how many calories a 65-pound child burns doing one hour of each activity.	3
Talk about lost and found! A team of scientists recently discovered some tiny critters in Indonesia. They are called pygmy tarsiers (PIG-mee TAWR-see-uhrss). Indonesia is a country in Asia. Experts thought the furry creatures were extinct, or completely gone. That’s because no one had seen the animals alive for about 70 years. The pygmy tarsier is a primate. Primates are an animal group that includes humans, apes, and monkeys. The little fur ball is less than 4 inches long. It weighs about 2 ounces. It has wide eyes, big ears, and a long tail. Scientists caught three pygmy tarsiers—two males and one female. They attached radio collars to their necks. Then they released the animals. When scientists return to Indonesia, they will track the collars to find and study the creatures. Professor Sharon Gursky-Doyen helped find the critters. She told WR News, “It’s very exciting knowing that the animal does still exist.”	3
Zach Levins doesn’t just play board games. He invents them! The teen is the brains behind a new game called Repeat or You’re Obsolete. Something that is obsolete is no longer in use. Zach got the idea for the game in class. “I learned the word obsolete in school,” he told WR News. “I thought it would be cool to make a catchy title with [it].” Repeat or You’re Obsolete is a memory game. Players have to remember and repeat words. They take turns until someone forgets to repeat one of the words. Anyone can come up with a game, Zach says. “You can take [anything] and turn it into something that you think is really cool.”	3

Weekly Reader students have been correct more than 90 percent of the time. Now you can be part of Weekly Reader’s poll. Who do you want to be the next president? You and your classmates can vote. Your teacher can send the results to WR News. Visit www.weeklyreader.com on October 29 to read the results. You can find out whether you and other Weekly Reader students picked the winning candidate on Election Day, November 4.	3
You may see fewer bats flying around this Halloween. Thousands of them are dying in the northeastern United States. Experts don’t know why. Many of the dying bats have white-nose syndrome. That is a sickness in which white mold-like patches grow on the bats’ noses, wings, and tails. It was first spotted on bats in New York in 2007. White-nose syndrome has since spread to bats in four other states. Spooky! Could these bats’ white noses be making them sick? Bats with the disease do some odd, or strange, things. Bats like to fly at night. However, some of the sick bats have been seen taking wing in daylight. Scientists are not sure what’s killing the bats. They are on a mission to learn more. This fall they will journey into some of the bats’ caves. They will attach radio transmitters to many of the creatures. That will allow scientists to study their movements and body temperatures. They might learn why bats are dying. “Something is killing the bats, and we don’t know what it is,” scientist Susi von Oettingen told WR News. “This is just the biggest mystery.”	3
On a hill in Africa, a mountain gorilla munches on bamboo. Nearby, a female gorilla moves slowly past. A baby gorilla holds on to her furry back. The gorillas live in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. That is a country in Africa. Their lives may seem peaceful, but there is a war going on in the national park where they live. A group of rebels is fighting the Congo government. Rebels are people who try to take over something, such as a country. The fighting has forced more than 250,000 people to leave. The gorillas are caught in the middle of the battle. The rebels took over their park, called Virunga National Park, more than a year ago. The park rangers who protect the apes had to flee, or run away. But the country’s president recently announced good news for the gorillas. The rebels and the government made a deal to let the rangers return to the park. “It is a huge step,” says park director Emmanuel de Merode. “Rangers ... should be allowed to do their job.” The rangers are working on a survey, or report, of the park’s gorillas. They want to find out how many of them still live there. The animals are endangered. There are only about 720 mountain gorillas in the world. About 200 live in the Congo. “The gorillas that we have in the wild are the only ones on Earth,” park spokesperson Samantha Newport told WR News. “Once they are gone, we will have lost an important species.”	3
Talk about being on a roll! The NASA rovers Spirit and Opportunity are alive at five. The rovers started exploring Mars five years ago. They haven’t stopped working since. A rover is a robotic spacecraft. Scientists thought the six-wheeled vehicles would survive for only 90 days. Instead, they’ve been busy little space buggies. The rovers have traveled more than 13 miles altogether. They have sent back more than 250,000 pictures of the planet’s rocky terrain, or land. The rovers determined that there was once water on Mars. But all their hard work has worn them out. Spirit has to drive backward because of a broken wheel. Opportunity has trouble moving its robotic arm. Still, they keep on roving. “We realize that a major [part] ... could fail at any time,” says NASA scientist John Callas. “On the other hand, we could [have] ... more missions on each rover in the year ahead.”	3
Hold on to your popcorn. The Smithsonian is coming to life! That is a group of museums in Washington, D.C. In his new movie, Night at the Museum: Battle of the Smithsonian, actor Ben Stiller tries to stop an evil king who comes to life at the museums. WR News student reporter Joshua Couch talked with Stiller about the movie. Joshua Couch: What’s it like on the movie set? Ben Stiller: It’s almost like being at the museum. ... The sets are so detailed [or exact]. You can actually read about the [displays] and learn their stories. JC: How much of the movie is special effects? BS: There’s a lot of stuff that ... they made with the computer, like a giant octopus that comes to life. ... The monkey was real because it slapped me for real, and it hurt! JC: What was your favorite part about making this film? BS: I got to see this incredible model airplane collection [at the Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum] that’s not on display.	3
The babies at a hospital in Asia are a little strange. They wear giant white diapers and have dark red hair that sticks up. They even flip out of their cribs. Why all the monkey business? The troublemaking patients are orangutans! An orangutan is a type of great ape. The animals are cared for at a special hospital and sanctuary, or protected area, for orangutans in Malaysia. That is a country in Asia. The hospital has the world’s only special care section for baby orangutans. The babies need that extra attention. Orangutans are endangered. Scientists estimate that only about 62,500 of the great apes are left. Most wild orangutans live in Indonesia. That is a country near Malaysia. The great apes’ habitats are shrinking because people are destroying the rain forests where they live. The people who run the hospital take good care of the infants, or babies. Nurses feed them with bottles. They also change their diapers and take their temperatures. They make sure the babies sleep for 15 hours a day. Once the great apes are older, they will learn to live by themselves in the wild. They will practice climbing trees and foraging, or searching, for food. When they are adults, they will be released back into the wild. “The ... plan [is to] return ... our 23 apes to the wild,” a vet at the hospital told reporters. “It is a matter of the survival of the species.” Orangutans aren’t the only endangered animals in Asia. Read about some other threatened species on the continent. Javan Rhinoceroses There are fewer than 60 Javan rhinos in the wild. They live in Indonesia and Vietnam. The animals are hunted for their horns. Irrawaddy Dolphins Only about 100 Irrawaddy dolphins are left in the wild. The swimmers live in Southeast Asian waters. Fishing nets harm them. Bengal Tigers There are only about 2,500 Bengal tigers left. They live in southern Asia. Poachers, or people who hunt illegally, target tigers for their fur.	3
For elementary school students in Idaho, it made “cents” to collect more than 300,000 pennies. Why? Abraham Lincoln appears on the coin, and the kids needed the money for a big birthday celebration in the 16th U.S. president’s honor. Lincoln was born 200 years ago, on Feb. 12, 1809. This month marks the bicentennial of his birth. A bicentennial is a 200th anniversary. The students in Idaho raised money to help relocate, or move, a statue of Lincoln to a park near the Idaho Capitol. The project is one of hundreds of events across the country being held to celebrate Lincoln’s birthday. In Washington, D.C., officials will honor Lincoln with a ceremony at the Lincoln Memorial. That is a special statue of the president. In other states, people will attend speeches and plays about the leader. “There are events being planned in all 50 states,” David Early told WR News. He is a spokesperson for the group that has been planning the celebrations. “[Lincoln] believed everyone should be treated the same.” Lincoln served as president during the Civil War (1861–1865). During that war, Southern states tried to break away from the country. They fought for their right to own slaves. Northern states were against owning slaves. Lincoln was also against slavery. In 1863, he signed the Emancipation Proclamation. It helped free most U.S. slaves. Abraham Lincoln was born in a log cabin in Kentucky. He moved to Illinois when he was a young man. There, he worked as a shop owner and a lawyer. Lincoln also served as a lawmaker for Illinois and the country. In 1842, Lincoln married Mary Todd. Together they had four sons. Lincoln became the 16th U.S. president in 1861. The Civil War started a few weeks later. Lincoln won reelection in 1864. The war was coming to an end in April 1865. Lincoln was shot on April 14, while watching a play in Washington, D.C. He died the next day. Lincoln is buried in Springfield, Ill.	3
Scientists digging in Egypt recently found a big surprise—a pyramid! They uncovered the ancient, or very old, structure under 65 feet of sand. Egypt is a country in Africa. “There was so much sand dumped here that no one had any idea there was something buried underneath,” says Zahi Hawass, an Egyptian archaeologist. That is a person who studies people and cultures of the past. He estimates, or guesses, that the monument is 4,300 years old. It might be the burial place for an Egyptian queen named Sesheshet. Sesheshet’s pyramid was bigger when it was built, experts say. It probably stood 45 feet tall, and each side was 72 feet long. Wind and sand have worn away the top of the pyramid. The remains are only 16 feet tall. Hawass and his team are busy digging to find more of the pyramid. They hope to get inside the structure to the burial chamber. That is a room where a person’s body was put after he or she died. Markings inside the room might say for sure who was buried there. Scientists don’t expect to find much else inside the burial chamber. That is because robbers most likely found the pyramid long ago. They probably took any gold or other treasures that were inside. Still, finding the pyramid is important, scientists say. “To find a new pyramid is always exciting,” Hawass explains. “And this one is magical. It belonged to a queen.” History: People have lived in Egypt for about 5,000 years. Early Egyptians invented forms of math and writing. They had the first national government. Geography: The Sahara is the world’s largest desert. It covers most of the country. The Nile River runs through Egypt. It is the longest river in the world. Landmarks: The Great Pyramid is the world’s largest pyramid. The Great Sphinx is located nearby. It has the body of a lion and the head of a human.	3
Celebrate Hispanic Heritage Month! Hispanic Americans are people whose families came to the United States from Spanish-speaking countries. They celebrate their heritage, or traditions, from September 15 to October 15. This year, more Hispanics are celebrating than ever before. Nearly 47 million Hispanic American people live in the United States. That number is growing, experts say. In fact, by 2050, that population is expected to triple, according to a report by the U.S. Census Bureau, a government agency. In 2050, nearly 133 million Hispanic Americans will live in the United States, the report predicts. Almost one of every three Americans will be Hispanic. There are several reasons for the huge growth, says Robert Bernstein of the Census Bureau. “The Hispanic population is younger People from Spanish-speaking countries also make up about half the immigrants who move to the United States each year, Bernstein says. An immigrant moves to a country where he or she was not born. Most Hispanic immigrants come from Central and South America. The changes will help make the U.S. population more diverse, or different. That sounds like another reason to celebrate!	3
What do dogs do when they’re afraid? Why do cats sleep with their paws tucked under their bodies? Make your best guesses on the Web sites freekibble.com and freekibblekat.com. Your answers—even wrong ones—will make sure that hungry dogs and cats have food. Mimi Ausland, 12, created the Web sites last year. The animal lover from Bend, Ore., wanted to help feed pets in animal shelters across the country. How do the Web sites work? Every day, Mimi posts two questions. One is about dogs, and one is about cats. For every question that someone answers, 10 pieces of dog or cat food are donated to an animal shelter. To donate is to give. A pet food company in Oregon provides the food. So far, Mimi has donated half a million meals to animals in shelters. “I want to keep on going until we can feed [animals at] as many shelters as possible,” she told WR News.	3
Michaela Teague, 8, recently played tic-tactoe in a whole new way. She took part in the game onstage at Pine Grove Elementary School in Parkville, Md. “We were asked math questions,” the third grader told WR News. “If we got them right, we chose a letter, an X or an O. It was really fun.” Michaela’s school was taking part in a program called Arithmetickles. The program teaches students that math can be fun. The name is based on the words arithmetic, or math, and tickles. Arithmetickles performers visit schools to put on shows. Students go onstage and participate in games and skits, or performances. They learn math skills such as addition, subtraction, and multiplication. In the game Seven Boo, kids take turns counting to 50. They can’t say certain numbers, such as the number seven. Instead, they have to shout “Boo!”	3
Scientists in Greenland are going ducky over their latest experiment. They’re using toy ducks to study ice! Greenland is a large island in Europe. It is near the North Pole. The scientists recently set loose 90 rubber ducks in the Jakobshavn (yah-cuhb-SAH-ven) Glacier on Greenland. A glacier is a large sheet of ice that moves slowly over land. Scientists dropped the ducks into tunnels in the glacier called moulins (MOO-lahnz). Melting ice on the glacier flows into the moulins. Some experts say global warming is causing the ice to melt. Global warming is the slow rise of Earth’s temperature. Where the water ends up is a mystery. That’s where the ducks come in. Scientists have labeled the toys with an e-mail address. They hope fishing crews will find the ducks and contact them. That will help scientists learn where the melting water travels.	3
Good-bye, Harry Potter! Hello, rats! In the film The Tale of Despereaux, actor Emma Watson plays a princess who befriends, or makes friends with, a mouse. Together, they try to defeat her castle’s mean rats. WR News student reporter Dayvon Snell interviewed Watson about the movie, which comes out this month. Dayvon Snell: Tell me a little bit about your new movie. Emma Watson: The Tale of Despereaux is ... about a mouse. He’s got these ... [huge] ears, but what really sets him apart ... is [that] he has courage. He falls in love with Princess Pea, who is my character. ... Despereaux ends up kind of saving the day. DS: How was making this movie different from your other projects? EW: This is [my] first animated film ... so it was a completely new experience for me. I had to [act out] everything I wanted to tell in the story through my voice. DS: Who has inspired you? EW: The most inspiring person in my life is ... J. K. Rowling. She’s so talented and so [smart]. Her books inspire people all over the world.	3
Get ready for a birthday party that’s out of this world. NASA turns 50 on October 1! The U.S. space agency has a lot to celebrate. NASA was founded, or started, in 1958. Since then, the agency has launched, or sent, more than 250 astronauts into space. The agency has also created robot spacecraft to explore distant, or faraway, planets. There are even U.S. astronauts living and working in space on the International Space Station. NASA officials have big plans for the next 50 years too. They plan to send humans back to the moon by 2020. U.S. astronauts first visited the moon in 1969. They stayed less than a day. This time, astronauts will live on the moon for up to six months. NASA is designing a new spacecraft to carry the astronauts to the moon. Scientists are also redesigning the space suit. They say astronauts will need lighter suits for exploring. Scientists hope that the moon mission will lead to an even bigger trip. NASA wants to send astronauts to Mars! The space agency has sent robot spacecraft called rovers to explore the Red Planet. NASA will send a new rover to Mars next fall. Scientists want to determine whether Mars could have supported life at one time. They hope astronauts will one day be able to answer that question themselves. “We’re trying to [go to Mars] as early as 2035,” Jeff Hanley of NASA told WR News. “Maybe someday in the far, far future [humans will reach] the stars.” NASA’s history is a blast from the past! Read the time line to learn some important firsts in U.S. space travel and exploration. 2008: The International Space Station is under construction. It should be finished by 2010. How would visiting Mars be different from visiting the moon? Why?	3
The White House is getting a new first family! Barack Obama, the next president; his wife, Michelle; and their daughters, Malia, 10, and Sasha, 7, are moving in on January 20. That is the day of Obama’s inauguration. At that event, he will become the 44th president of the United States. He will also become the country’s first African American president. Obama will make an oath, or promise, to protect the U.S. Constitution. For Malia and Sasha, January will be a fun-filled month. The girls will start at their new school. Once the Obamas are settled in the White House, they will also get a puppy. Obama, however, will be too busy for playtime. He has been working hard since he won the election on November 4. Obama has been choosing his Cabinet. That is a group of aides, or helpers. The Cabinet helps the president make important decisions. The Cabinet includes Joe Biden, the vice president. Obama picked Rahm Emanuel to be the White House chief of staff. He will be Obama’s closest aide. Obama and members of his Cabinet face many challenges. Some U.S. companies are struggling. Many Americans cannot pay for food or their homes. Obama must also decide how to handle the war in Iraq. That is a country in the Middle East. “The challenges we face as a nation are now more ... difficult,” Obama says. “But I have no doubt that we can meet them.” Every president makes the same promise at the inauguration—to protect the Constitution. Some presidents still make their celebrations stand out. Here’s how. James Madison was the first president to hold an inaugural ball. He and his wife, Dolley, didn’t dance, though. They watched the 1809 ball from a platform. William Henry Harrison’s first speech in 1841 was the longest ever—8,445 words! He did not wear a coat that day. Harrison got sick and died 31 days later. In 1997, Bill Clinton went where no president had gone before—the Internet! His inauguration was the first one shown live online.	3
Giant pandas feast on bamboo at the Beijing Zoo in China. These animals, including the newborn panda (inset), live in captivity. China is hosting a panda party! Nine giant panda bears were recently born in the Asian country. Most of them are pairs of twins. The cubs were born in captivity. That means they live in places controlled by humans rather than in the wild. These pandas live in special centers where animal experts care for them. That’s a good thing, because giant pandas need all the help they can get. The animals are endangered, or at risk of dying out completely. Only about 1,600 giant pandas live in the wild. Pandas’ favorite food is bamboo, but they have trouble finding enough of it to eat. Almost all of the bamboo in their habitat, or home, has died off. The bamboo has died in part because people have built cities where pandas live. People created the panda centers to help keep the giant pandas safe. One of the most famous centers is the Wolong Nature Reserve. It is in southwest China. More than 100 giant pandas have been born there since it opened in 1980. The goal is for the young pandas to be able to live safely in the wild one day. Until then, some of the animals will continue to live in captivity. Scientists in China hope to raise more giant pandas within the next few years. China’s giant panda cubs aren’t the only baby animals making the news. Read to learn about other rare, or unique, newborn animals. White Lion Cubs Seven white lion cubs were recently born in Germany at a safari park. All of the white lions in the world live in captivity. Hairless Pig Hadiah is a type of hairless pig. She was born at the Houston Zoo in Texas. Little Hadiah weighed about 1 pound at birth. Sea Horses More than 120 shortsnouted sea horses were recently born at an England aquarium. They will grow up to look like this one.	3
When Sam Roffwarg was 18 months old, someone on an airplane gave him a snack pack of peanuts. Sam ate a few of the nuts. Suddenly, he was throwing up and gasping for air because he couldn’t breathe. It turned out that Sam, now 8, has a peanut allergy. An allergy is a bad reaction to something. Today, the third grader from Jackson, Miss., is careful about what he eats. “I always read the ingredients,” Sam told WR News. “My mom has trained me.” Staying away from peanuts is hard when Sam goes to school, though. When other kids eat peanut butter, Sam has to be sure not to sit near them. Just touching a peanut could make him sick. A severe, or strong, allergic reaction could be life threatening. To protect kids, some schools are limiting or banning peanuts. A survey of about 1,200 school districts found that 18 percent of schools had some type of peanut ban in 2007. Some officials say the bans are needed to protect kids with allergies. About 400,000 school-age children have peanut allergies, and experts say that number is growing. Still, most kids are not allergic to peanuts. Some people say banning peanuts is not fair. Plus, they say, keeping track of what every kid eats is impossible. “You just can’t monitor what’s in every person’s lunch pail,” says Janet Mitchell, a school district representative in Georgia. Food is not the only thing that can cause allergic reactions. Here is a magnified, or close-up, look at some other allergens, or things that may set off allergies. Dust mites Tiny dust mites live in the dust found on furniture and in carpets. They are invisible to the naked eye, but they cause asthma and breathing problems for some people. Mold This allergen is often found in moist, damp areas, such as basements and bathrooms. Mold gives off a type of bacterium, or germ, that can trigger allergy symptoms. Should schools limit or ban peanuts? Why or why not?	3
Talk about a cool birthday gift! In 2009, the United States Mint will release four new penny designs featuring, or showing, scenes from Abraham Lincoln’s life. The coins are in honor of the U.S. president’s 200th birthday on February 12. The U.S. Mint makes currency, or money. Officials say it makes “cents” to redesign the penny. That’s because next year marks the 100th anniversary of the original Lincoln penny design. “We know that Americans really love the penny,” U.S. Mint spokesperson Carla Coolman told WR News. “There’s a great [love] for President Lincoln too.” The designs will be featured on the back side of the coins. They will represent different stages of Lincoln’s life, from his childhood in Kentucky to his presidency. He served as president from 1861 to 1865. The first Lincoln coin will be released February 12. The rest will be released at later dates. Coin collectors, get ready!	3
The third-grade class at Mulberry School has gone to the birds! A dark gray parrot regularly visits the Los Gatos, Calif., classroom to sit in on students’ reading lessons. The parrot’s name is Starbuck. He perches, or sits, on a chair and listens to the students read aloud. During the stories, Starbuck bobs his head, ruffles his feathers, and makes sounds. “He responds in so many ways,” teacher Judy Quigley told WR News. Sharing a book with Starbuck helps students feel comfortable reading aloud because they don’t worry about making mistakes. “When you read to people, sometimes they don’t really listen, but he always listens,” Anna Averfa-Goodman, 9, told WR News. Students keep Starbuck’s attention by changing their reading styles during stories. “I say it kind of louder so he can hear it,” explains Justine Hoover, 9. If that doesn’t work, the third graders have another trick. They read the parrot a book about worms!	3
Write a poem about a state? A book of those would be just great! Kids in California, Oregon, and Washington recently teamed up to write alphabet books about their home states. The books describe the state’s famous features. Each feature is described in a couplet. That is two lines of poetry that rhyme. Each line usually has the same number of beats. The young authors had fun writing their poems. “I just thought up some rhymes about what the beach looked like,” Aesha Mokashi, 8, told WR News. Aesha wrote about kites on the beach for O is for Oregon. Her poem is: “Soaring in the turquoise sky / Colorful like a butterfly.” Kids in Colorado and New York are writing poems for the next two books. Will your state be next? Try to write some rhyming text!	3
Dogs? Cats? Not for Judson King. The boy wanted a more unusual pet—a hedgehog! But owning hedgehogs was against the law where Judson lives, in Lawrence, Kan. People were worried they might carry disease. Learning that hedgehogs were illegal “broke my heart,” Judson, 11, told WR News. “I decided I wanted to make them legal.” He studied up on hedgehogs. Then he wrote a letter to city officials challenging, or questioning, the rule. Last fall, the officials invited Judson to speak at a meeting. He showed up with folders full of facts about hedgehogs. Doing all that homework made a difference. The officials decided to change the city rule in December. Judson’s efforts really paid off on Christmas. His mom gave him his best gift last—a baby hedgehog that Judson named Little Luke.	3
One hundred years ago, the idea of an African American becoming president of the United States would have seemed impossible. Back then, black people faced discrimination. That is the act of treating others unfairly. In parts of the United States, black people were not allowed to attend the same schools as white students. They even had to drink from separate water fountains. The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) fought discrimination. The group formed in 1909. This year the NAACP is celebrating its 100th anniversary. It is the oldest and largest civil rights organization in the country. Civil rights make sure people are treated equally. The NAACP is planning many celebrations. It will hold ceremonies, TV specials, and a national meeting this summer. “Our nation has grown so much,” Hilary Shelton, a director of the NAACP, told WR News. “It’s important to recognize [that].”	3
No time to play or relax at school? That could lead to trouble for some kids, researchers say. Students who don’t have recess may be more likely to misbehave during class time. That is according to a new study. Researchers observed, or watched, more than 10,000 students in school. The kids were ages 8 and 9. Children who had at least a 15-minute recess during school behaved better in class than kids who did not get a break. About 40 percent of schools do not have recess, reports the International Play Association (IPA). That is a group that tracks kids’ playtime. Certain schools cut recess so teachers have more time to teach. However, some experts say kids need recess because it teaches them social skills. Those are skills that help people work together.	3
Blair Hedges, a college professor, found the snake in Barbados. That is an island in the Caribbean Sea. The reptile was under a rock. A reptile is an animal that crawls or slithers, has scales or bony plates, and lays eggs. Reptiles are cold-blooded. That means their body temperature depends on their environment. The snake is toothpick-thin. “[It] has stripes and little spots on the head, but it’s very hard to see them,” Hedges told WR News. “You have to use a microscope.” The reptile isn’t Hedges’s only “little” discovery. The professor also found the world’s smallest frog and lizard.	3
Martin Luther King Jr. is famous for his “I Have a Dream” speech of 1963. Builders in Washington, D.C., have a dream of their own—to build a monument in King’s honor. Their dream is starting to come true. Construction recently began on the Washington, D.C. Martin Luther King, Jr. National Memorial. The project will be finished in 2010. People want to celebrate King because of the good work he did. King (1929–1968) grew up in the southern United States. At that time, the South was segregated, or separated, by race. Under the law, black people could not attend the same schools as white people. They also had to use separate restrooms and drinking fountains. King worked to change the laws. He gave speeches and led peaceful marches. Thanks to King and other leaders, Congress passed civil rights laws. Those laws make sure that Americans have equal rights.	3
One small step for a woman, one giant leap for womankind! Astronaut Sally Ride became the first American woman to voyage, or travel, to space. She made the journey 25 years ago on June 18, 1983. WR News student reporter Leah Meador talked with Ride about her starring role in NASA’s history. Leah Meador: How did you feel when you were going into space? Sally Ride: I was unbelievably excited. There is no amusement park ride even close to the experience of flying into space. LM: What inspired you to become an astronaut? SR: I was always interested in science from the time that I was in second or third grade. Science was always my favorite subject. LM: What did it mean to you to be the first U.S. woman to go into space? SR: It meant a lot to me to be [a] role model ... for young girls who wanted to be astronauts. LM: Who is the person that supported you the most while you were trying to become an astronaut? SR: My high school science teacher. She was a good teacher, but what was really important to me is that she helped me build my confidence ... She helped me believe in myself.	3
Sure, scooters can be fun to ride, but Jessica Liddicoat has an idea to make them even better. The third grader from Tucson, Ariz., wants to add a kite and a drink holder! The young inventor and her classmates are building toys for a school project. First, the students visited a local toy shop to learn what makes a good toy. Then, they came up with their own ideas for toys. Next, students drew blueprints for their inventions. A blueprint is a drawing that shows how to make something. Now, the third graders are building their toys. One student is creating a math card game. Another student has an idea for a special chair to hold toy animals. Teacher Liz Bradshaw runs the project. She says making toys helps kids think for themselves. “This is a way to ... create [ideas] and make them come to life,” she told WR News. That’s what Maura Pierce likes about building toys. She is inventing a set of musical instruments. “I enjoy this,” she says, “because I’m a really crafty person.”	3
Would you like to write for WR News? The magazine is looking for student reporters for next school year—and you could be one of them! Student reporters write stories and report on big events, such as the Super Bowl. This school year’s reporters wrote news debates. Those are articles that show two sides of an issue or idea. Some reporters interviewed famous people. They talked with the Jonas Brothers and author and retired football player Tiki Barber. If you like to write and are interested in the news, this is the job for you! To apply, write a 200- to 300-word essay. Your essay should explain whom you would most like to interview and why. Include some of the questions you would want to ask that person. Send in the essay, an entry form, and your school photograph.	3
To make some extra green, people are going green! They are recycling more. To recycle is to put items through a special process so they can be reused. More and more people haul, or carry, old bicycles and heaps of soft drink cans to local John Krasniewicz runs Vulcan Scrap in Stamford, Conn. His usual customers are builders. Now he has some new customers. Lately, he has seen all kinds of people recycling old items. “People know that metal is worth more now,” he told WR News. Aluminum cans used to go for about 30 cents a pound. Now they’re worth about 75 cents a pound. Recycling gives people extra money and also helps the environment. Less junk will pile up in landfills, which will help keep the planet clean.	3
Brightly colored fish dart in and out of the Great Barrier Reef. That is a coral reef in Australia. Australia is a country and a continent. A coral reef is a large underwater structure full of plants and animals. Coral is made of tiny sea animals called polyps. When polyps die, their hard shells become part of the reef. Scientists recently explored the world’s largest coral reef. They also looked at another reef near Australia. Their search turned up hundreds of animal species. Some of the species may have never been seen before. Scientists used netted bags to search the reef. They spied big-clawed shrimp and worms shaped like pine trees. They also found about 130 new types of soft coral. The researchers left behind 36 plastic “houses” on the ocean floor. The scientists hope the creatures will move into the houses. That will make it easier to study them. Learning about the creatures may help people protect them. One-third of the world’s coral reefs are threatened by pollution and fishing. It’s important to find out what’s in the Great Barrier Reef, says scientist Patricia Hendriks. She took part in the expedition, or trip with a specific goal. “If we don’t know what is present in the first place, how are we ever going to protect it properly?” What species did scientists spy in the Great Barrier Reef? Here are a few that made a splash. This green-banded snapping shrimp has a large claw on one side. It looks like a tiny lobster. This Christmas tree worm rests on a coral reef. It uses its “branches” to breathe and eat. The cuttlefish is a boneless animal related to squid. It has eight arms that it uses to catch food. This gorgonian fan won the hearts of researchers. The soft coral fan stretches more than 3 feet tall.	3
What is colorful, plastic, and nearly 100 feet tall? The world’s tallest LEGO tower! The tower was recently constructed, or built, in Vienna, Austria. Austria is a country in Europe. The plastic creation broke the previous world record for the tallest LEGO building. Something that is previous came before. The tower was made up of about 460,000 LEGOs. More than 3,000 people helped build it in four days. Most of the builders were children. Each young helper made a part of the tower. The designs were different, says LEGO spokesperson Kate Sutch. Some kids built their sections in patterns. “Breaking the record feels amazing,” Sutch told WR News. “It took ... hard work and creativity, but in the end, the kids of Vienna [did it]!”	3
The United States is in a spin cycle! Several powerful hurricanes hit the country this summer, and scientists say more are on the way. Hurricanes are strong storms that form over oceans. The winds can blow more than 150 miles per hour. Scientists predicted, or guessed, that seven to 10 hurricanes will form in the Atlantic Ocean this season. That is above This map shows the number of hurricanes in the five states that had the most of those storms from 1851 to 2006. Note: Alaska and Hawaii are not shown. What’s causing the active, or busy, hurricane season? Warm water and wind, says Gerry Bell. He is one of the government’s top hurricane forecasters. A forecaster uses information to predict what will happen. This year, the Atlantic Ocean is warmer than it usually is. That helps whip up more storms. “Warm water provides a lot of moisture for hurricanes,” Bell told WR News. The current wind conditions are also perfect for storms, he says. Stronger hurricanes form when the speed and direction of wind is the same along much of the East Coast of the United States. The worst of the storms may be over soon. “Usually by mid-October, [they] don’t really affect the United States anymore,” Bell says.	3
Kids who play musical instruments do better in school than kids who don’t. That is according to a new study. Researchers studied kids ages 8 to 11. They compared kids who have played musical instruments for at least three years with kids who do not play any. Musicians in the study played the piano or string instruments, such as the violin. They scored 15 percent higher in vocabulary. They scored 11 percent higher in reading. Researcher Ellen Winner helped conduct, or run, the study. She says the results prove that practice pays off. “Learning to be good at an instrument [takes] lots of attention [and] concentration,” she told WR News. “These are skills that will help you in any walk of life.”	3
Space officials have a huge mess on their hands! Two satellites recently slammed into each other in outer space. A satellite is an object that circles something else, such as a planet. The collision, or crash, took place about 500 miles above Earth. It was the first collision between two satellites in space. The crash has scientists worried—and for good reason. There’s a lot of stuff floating around in space, and most of it is junk. Space junk includes objects that have been left behind in space. There are about 1 million pieces of space junk floating around Earth. Space junk includes satellite debris, nuts and bolts, and old rocket parts. Debris are pieces of something that has been broken or destroyed. There is also a camera, a golf ball, and several screwdrivers in space. There is even a spatula floating around our planet! Spatulas and tiny satellite parts may not sound dangerous. However, some objects can zip around Earth at up to 25,000 miles per hour. Going that fast, even the smallest debris can damage spacecraft. The space junk could “trash” important equipment, such as the International Space Station. The floating lab cost more than $100 billion to build. Scientists are trying to come up with a solution to deal with space junk. Some want to figure out how to bring the objects back to Earth. The European Space Agency (ESA) wants to learn exactly where the debris is located. That way, astronauts can avoid it. “The problem of space debris is unique [or uncommon],” says ESA spokesperson Jean-Francois Kaufeler. “We need to work together ... if we are going to solve it.” Scientists have sent hundreds of satellites into space. Some satellites track weather. Others send signals to radios, televisions, cell phones, and computers. Check out some different types of satellites. This was the first artificial, or human-made, satellite launched into space, in 1957. Sputnik 1 sent radio signals back to Earth. It burned up after three months in space. The Hubble Space Telescope was launched in 1990. It takes photos of our solar system. The photos help scientists learn about space. The NOAA-18 launched in 2005. The satellite tracks temperatures. Scientists use that information to predict, or guess, weather, such as big storms.	3
Life in space is about to get a little spacier! The International Space Station is getting a makeover. The station is a lab in space where astronauts live and work. Astronauts are adding two bedrooms, a bathroom, and a mini kitchen. The new parts were delivered by the space shuttle Endeavour. Before this, the space station had only three bedrooms and one bathroom. Astronauts have been building the space station since 1998. The new rooms will allow more astronauts to live at the space station at the same time. Having more astronauts in space could help scientists gather new information about space more quickly. Currently, or right now, only three astronauts can stay on the space station. Officials hope six astronauts will be able to live there at the same time by May or June. That’s not the only change. Endeavour also brought technology to the space station. A new system will turn the astronauts’ urine into drinking water. That might sound gross, but recycling, or reusing, the liquid will make sure the space station has water. Right now, water is rocketed to the space station from Earth. Astronaut Christopher Ferguson says the same technology could be used on Earth one day. “We’re going to need to have these technologies in place, and this is a great way to get started.” Why do astronauts float in space? There is no gravity. That is a force that pulls your body toward Earth. Here’s how astronauts eat, sleep, and exercise on the space station. Eating: Astronauts put their feet in special holders to help them stay seated at the table. Food containers stick to trays with Velcro. Sleeping: Astronauts can sleep standing up! Their sleeping bags are attached to the space station’s walls. They strap themselves in for naps. Exercising: Astronauts stay in shape by exercising for up to two hours every day. They strap themselves to exercise bikes and treadmills.	3
Superman may not be the only speedster faster than a speeding bullet. A team of engineers, or designers, in England is building the world’s fastest car. England is a country in Europe. The Bloodhound SSC will travel at more than 1,000 miles per hour (mph). Most automobiles reach top speeds of about 120 mph. Engineers hope that the Bloodhound will zoom into the record books. They also hope the car will get kids excited to learn about science. How will the Bloodhound be so speedy? The vehicle will be powered by a rocket and a jet engine. Engineers hope to finish the car by 2011. Then driver Andy Green will get behind the Bloodhound’s wheel and try to set the new speed record. He set the current record in 1997, when he drove another vehicle at 763 mph.	3
Scientists in Bolivia recently figured out that bugs help make some chili peppers spicy. Bolivia is a country in South America. Certain types of bugs can poke holes in a chili pepper’s skin. That leaves the pepper open to becoming infected, or sick. Chili peppers create special chemicals to keep the bugs away. Those chemicals also give peppers their famous spicy flavor. Ready for some more “hot” news? Some chili peppers get even spicier as they grow. “Peppers increase ... their heat as they ripen,” scientist Joshua Tewksbury told reporters. “I think a lot of plants would love to come up with this [way to keep bugs away].”	3
Talk about a toy that sticks around! The National Toy Hall of Fame recently added a surprising plaything—a stick! Other toys to join the Hall of Fame this past fall include the skateboard and the baby doll. The toys are kept at the Strong National Museum of Play in Rochester, N.Y. The twiggy toy holds many playtime possibilities. “[It] can be used ... to draw in the sand on a beach or [used as] a magic wand,” says Chris Bensch. He is the museum’s curator. A curator is a person in charge of a place where things are on display. Plus, kids don’t have to save money to get their hands on a stick. “The best toy is often a plaything that’s free [and] easy to get,” Bensch says. Do you have an idea for the next top toy? Visit www.strongmuseum.org to suggest your favorite toy or game for the Hall of Fame.	3
Danica Patrick doesn’t let anything stop her. When she’s in her race car, she puts the pedal to the metal and flies. Last spring, she became the first woman to win an event in the Indy Racing League. Patrick wasn’t the only woman to race into the record books last year. Women around the country pulled off historic, or important, firsts. Hillary Clinton set her sights on the White House. In 2008, she was the first woman to be a presidential candidate on every state ballot. Now she is the U.S. secretary of state. Michelle Obama had her own fantastic first. The former lawyer became the country’s first African American first lady. Her husband, Barack Obama, was elected president on November 4. Peggy Whitson’s recent achievement was out of this world. An achievement is an accomplishment. The astronaut was the first woman to command the International Space Station. She finished her job on the floating lab last April. Ann Dunwoody also had a “major” achievement. In November, she became the first female four-star general in the U.S. military. That is the second-highest rank in the U.S. Army. A rank is a position. The achievements of those and other women can encourage girls. “I’ve heard from moms and dads who see [my accomplishment] as ... hope for their daughters,” Dunwoody says. “Anything is possible through hard work.” Danica Patrick and the other women didn’t get to where they are alone. Here’s a look at some of the women who helped make their achievements possible. Martha Washington was the country’s first first lady. Her husband, George Washington, was president from 1789 to 1797. Janet Guthrie became the first woman to qualify for a major car race, in 1977. She placed ninth in the Indianapolis 500 race in 1978. The Women’s Army Corps became part of the U.S. Army in 1943. More than 17,000 women served overseas during World War II. Sally Ride blasted off in 1983 to become the first U.S. woman in space. Her two space shuttle missions lasted about 343 hours. What would you like to be the first person to accomplish? Why?	3
The 12-year-old from Coventry, Conn., runs the Cool Coventry Club. The club teaches people how to conserve, or save, energy. More than 600 families have joined Colin’s club. The student recently won a Gloria Barron Prize for Young Heroes for his work. Each member of the Cool Coventry Club has to promise to use less energy in at least three ways. The changes can help people save money and Earth at the same time, Colin says. “Turn off the light when you leave a room. Turn off the water when you’re brushing your teeth,” Colin told WR News. “It’s little things like that that really make a big difference.”	3
Talk about a “monster” discovery! Scientists in Colombia recently unearthed, or dug up, fossils of the world’s largest snake. Colombia is a country in South America. The snake is called Titanoboa cerrejonensis (ty-ta-noh-BOH-uh sai-rah-HOH-nen-siss). It weighed 2,500 pounds and measured about 42 feet long. Its massive, or huge, body was at least 3 feet wide. Titanoboa lived between 58 million and 60 million years ago, experts believe. So far, a team of scientists has found about 180 fossils from more than 20 Titanoboa snakes. The fossils include backbones and ribs. The scientists plan to return to Colombia to look for more bones. Experts also hope to learn what—and how much—Titanoboa ate. They think it may have hunted several types of animals, including crocodiles, large fish, and turtles. “It could easily eat something the size of a cow,” Conrad explains. “A human would just be toast.”	3
Tyler Smith, 11, loves football. He plays football with his friends for fun. He watches his favorite team, the New England Patriots, on TV. He even collects football cards. And soon Tyler will get to attend football’s most important game—the Super Bowl! The big matchup will take place on February 1 in Tampa, Fla. Tyler is going to cover the super sporting event for WR News. As a student reporter, Tyler will interview football players before the Super Bowl. Then he’ll watch the game from a press box in the stadium. A press box is a place where professional reporters sit during a game. What is Tyler looking forward to most about covering the Super Bowl? “Interviewing the players and getting their [thoughts about] the game,” he says.	3
Your used wrappers and empty boxes could be more than just garbage. The items could help people in need. Inventor Max Wallack can prove it. The 12-year-old student from Massachusetts recently invented the Home Dome. It is a small structure, or building. It is made of garbage such as plastic, wire, and packing peanuts. The structure could provide shelter for homeless people. Max’s invention helped him win the grand prize in the Trash to Treasure contest. That is a nationwide contest for kids. It is organized by the PBS television program Design Squad. Max won $10,000. As part of his prize, the inventor met some designers. Together, they built a prototype of the Home Dome. A prototype is a model. Max has wanted to help homeless people since he was a little kid. He hopes they can use his creation. “I always thought of ways to help the [homeless],” he told WR News. “When this contest came along, I thought this was the best way to [do that].”	3
What did Casey Sokolovic decide to do when she learned that sea turtles were in trouble? A lot! The student from Winterville, N.C., founded a program called Help Them LAST. That stands for Love a Sea Turtle. Casey, 11, raises money for the ocean swimmers. She does everything from selling turtle-shaped cookies to organizing fund-raising events at her school. So far, Casey’s program has raised about $2,500 for a local center that cares for sea turtles. The reptiles are at risk of losing their habitat, or home. People overcrowd the beaches where sea turtles lay their eggs. Some of the animals are killed or injured by boats. To be injured is to be hurt. Casey is always coming up with new ways to help sea turtles. Recently, she teamed up with a coffee company to raise money for the animals. She also hopes to create a sea turtle Web site. “It’s good to do something for the sea turtles,” Casey told WR News. “They need some help.”	3
What has kids in New York City jumping for joy? Double Dutch! The city is bringing the jump-roping game to its school teams this spring. School officials hope double Dutch will motivate more students to play sports. To motivate is to give a reason for doing something. New York is the first state to recognize double Dutch as a school sport. Learning the ropes for double Dutch takes practice. Teams have two turners who twirl two ropes at once. They might sing songs or rhymes while turning the ropes. At least one jumper hops in the ropes. Jumpers earn points for speed and special moves, such as dancing and cartwheels. Danaeja Williams, 8, can do some of the fancy moves. The New York City fourth grader has won awards for playing double Dutch. “It’s fun for me,” Danaeja told WR News. “I can do push-ups while jumping rope.”	3
A volcano in Chile has rumbled to life once again. Chile is a country in South America. Last May, the 2,700-foot-tall volcano erupted for the first time in 9,000 years. The huge eruption destroyed the town of Chaitén. The town is 6 miles from the volcano. After the 2008 explosion, about 5,000 of the town’s residents were evacuated. To be evacuated is to be forced to leave for one’s safety. Since the volcano began to erupt again, the few people still living in Chaitén—about 150—were evacuated. Government officials have decided to move the town to a safer area. Chaitén will be rebuilt about 6 miles north of its present location. “It is dangerous to stay in the area,” government leader Edmundo Pérez Yoma told reporters. “[Residents] must leave.”	3
Kids at the school in Houston chow down on everything from strawberries to sweet potatoes. They grow all the food themselves in a school garden. Then they harvest the fruits and veggies and turn them into healthy meals. To harvest is to collect. The students got their green thumbs—and their appetites for fresh food—from the Recipe for Success Foundation. That group teaches kids about the food they eat. “We make good food fun,” says Gracie Cavnar, the group’s founder. Professional, or working, chefs help students to make a variety of meals. A variety is many different types. Some recipes call for foods that the kids may not have had before, such as tofu. But the students promise to try everything that they cook. Travoyie McCardell, 9, ended up loving the chicken masala pizza that he made with his classmates. “It tastes like chicken and vegetables and spices and herbs all mixed into one big meal,” the third grader told WR News. The program doesn’t just get kids eating healthy at school. It also can change the way their families eat. Students get to bring home recipes to try with their parents. “We used to eat out 24-7,” Travoyie says. “Now we just eat out a few times a month.” What does it take for a tiny seed to turn into a leafy plant? Let’s take a look to find out. (1) Seeds need water and oxygen to grow. Most seeds grow best between 65 and 85 degrees Fahrenheit. (2) After a seed takes in water, a root pushes out from the seed. The root collects water and minerals from the soil. (3) A stem and leaves come out of the seed and grow upward. The stem brings water and minerals to the leaves. (4) The leaves use sunlight to make food for the plant. That process is called photosynthesis (foh-toh-SIN-thuh-siss).	3
The Acela is fast because the eight-car train has two locomotives. Most other trains have only one locomotive. One locomotive on Acela is located in front of the train, and the other locomotive is located in the rear. The two locomotives move Acela along at 150 miles per hour.	4
"Many U.S. kids share their bedrooms with a brother or sister. Sharing a room can be a pain. In October, six scientists squeezed into a small underwater laboratory to study a coral reef. They worked and slept in the tiny space for ten days. They, too, found that sharing space isn't easy. ""I've been on missions where people snored,"" said Celia Smith, who led the mission in October. ""You just kind of kick their bunk and try to get to sleep before they do."" The underwater lab is called Aquarius. It looks like a little yellow submarine. The Aquarius was placed near the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary, a protected area of the ocean, in 1998. Each year for the last two years, several teams of scientists have lived in Aquarius for up to ten days at a time. The scientists who live and work in Aquarius are called aquanauts. The aquanauts study the nearby coral reef and the creatures that live in it. Aquarius is located about 63 feet deep in the ocean. It has sleeping space for six aquanauts, a bathroom, a trash compactor, and computer stations. Electrical cables and tubes connect the Aquarius to a buoy on the ocean's surface. The tubes carry fresh air to the Aquarius, and the cables supply electricity. The work the aquanauts are doing is expected to help NASA. NASA scientists say that living and working on the Aquarius is similar to what it will be like to live and work in a space station. They hope to better prepare astronauts for space by studying how the aquanauts live and work underwater. The latest team to visit Aquarius says the best part of living there is the view. They can see colorful fish swimming in the nearby reef. Smith said it's hard to tell, though, whether the aquanauts are watching the fish or the fish are watching the aquanauts. The aquanauts spend as much time as they can on the reef studying sea life. They can spend up to nine hours at one time outside the laboratory. Smith likes to remind people that humans have barely begun to explore the oceans and need to learn more about life in the deep. ""The really important thing for us to realize is how much we don't know about the oceans,"" she said. Coral reefs have been called the rain forests of the oceans. Just as many of the world's land plants and animals live in rain forests, many sea creatures live in coral reefs. Coral reefs are in danger. One-fourth of the world's coral reefs have already been destroyed, and the remaining reefs could be destroyed within the next century, scientists say. Overfishing, pollution, and global warming are destroying many coral reefs, scientists explain. For example, global warming has gradually warmed the shallow ocean waters where coral reefs usually form. The warmer water has killed many algae, the tiny plants that give coral reefs their color and provide nourishment to the animals that form reefs. Scientist Valerie Paul worries that all the world's coral reefs will be destroyed early this century. ""It is like losing the rain forests all at once,"" she said."	4
"In 1933, a discovery in Africa excited scientists around the world. They had found a species, or kind, of monkey that they had never seen before--the Miss Waldron's red colobus monkey. Now, only 77 years after it was found, that monkey is extinct, scientists recently announced. No one has seen a Miss Waldron's red colobus monkey for more than 20 years. In 1988, scientists declared the monkey an endangered species. For the last seven years, scientists searched for the monkey in Ghana and Côte d'Ivoire (Ivory Coast), two countries in western Africa. They found no sign of the animal. Miss Waldron's red colobus monkey was the first primate --which includes monkeys and apes--to become extinct in nearly 300 years. But scientists say it will not be the last. They worry that many of the 600 other primate species may die out within the next 100 years. Twenty-five species may die out within ten to 20 years. More than 120 primate species may become extinct before the end of this century, said Ross MacPhee of New York City's American Museum of Natural History. Endangered primates live in Africa, Asia, and South America. Many of those primates live in areas where people are poor and need to hunt for food to survive. Scientists fear that unlimited hunting could kill off more primates. ""Miss Waldron's red colobus monkey was eaten by people. The last ones probably went into someone's pot,"" said scientist John Terborgh. MacPhee explained that the best way to help primates is to protect them and the areas where they live. ""As long as there are a few individuals, and as long as humans leave them alone, they'll come back [from near extinction]."""	4
Recently, Vice President Al Gore invited two Weekly Reader kid reporters to interview him. Fifth grader Daniel Calderone and sixth grader Kimberly Hernandez caught up with the vice president at the Elizabeth Avenue Learning Center in Cudahy, California. Weekly Reader: Who is your hero or role model? Why? Gore: I'm for common sense restrictions on guns. I think that we should have tougher laws against guns falling into the hands of the wrong people. I think that we should have mandatory child-safety trigger locks. I think that we should have a photo license ID requirement for the purchase of a new handgun. I think that we should have a limit on the number of handguns per month that could be bought--a limit of one. And I think these kinds of common sense gun safety measures would help to save a lot of lives. Gore: I've worked on the problem of global warming for more than 20 years. I believe that we need to build new kinds of cars and trucks that make much less pollution. And I think that we can create a lot of good jobs by building and selling the new kinds of technologies that the rest of the world is trying to buy. WR: Some people say we have an immigration problem. What will you do about immigrants? Gore: I would end discrimination against immigrants, because we are a nation of immigrants. I would enact a hate crimes law and enforce the civil rights law. And I would focus especially on the Hispanic dropout problem and have an intensive program to increase the high school graduation rate and the college attendance rate.	4
Some people get alligators and crocodiles mixed up. But they are very different. Here are a few of the differences between the two kinds of reptiles. A crocodile has a pointed snout. The fourth bottom tooth on each side sticks out when the croc's mouth is closed. An alligator has a broad, flat snout. It is not as fierce as a crocodile.	4
"On February 12, scientists on Earth fired rockets on the NEAR Shoemaker spacecraft, turning it toward Eros. Eros is an asteroid, or space rock that is orbiting the sun. As the spacecraft slowly descended, it bounced and scientists were afraid the craft would crash. Shown is the location of the asteroid belt in our solar system, and the orbit of Eros. Note: The planets and their orbits are not drawn to scale. NEAR Shoemaker began its incredible space odyssey five years ago. NASA (National Aeronautics and Space Administration) launched the spacecraft in 1996. For the next four years, NEAR Shoemaker sped toward Eros, covering nearly 2 billion miles. After studying a few other space objects, the spacecraft settled into orbit around Eros on February 14, 2000. During the following year, the craft took more than 160,000 photos of the potato-shaped asteroid. After NEAR Shoemaker completed its mission orbiting Eros, NASA scientists decided to try to land the car-sized spacecraft on the asteroid. If the craft succeeded, NEAR Shoemaker would become the first craft to land on an asteroid. Scientists knew that the odds were against a safe landing, but they thought it was worth trying. ""Chances [were] less than 1 percent for [NEAR-Shoemaker] to land intact,"" said scientist Helen Worth. NASA scientists on Earth guided the spacecraft toward the surface of Eros by remote control. Descending at 4 miles per hour, the spacecraft landed after bouncing once. Thinking that the spacecraft had crashed, scientists were surprised to learn that it was sending information from the asteroid's surface. ""It's working, and we are getting good information,"" said NASA scientist Jacob Trombka shortly after the landing. As a result of the successful landing, NASA continued the mission for an additional ten days. Scientists already know that most asteroids orbit the sun between Mars and Jupiter in an area called the asteroid belt. Eros, however, is a kind of asteroid that comes closer to Earth than most asteroids. Such asteroids are called near-Earth asteroids. Scientists believe that Eros may be similar to the near-Earth asteroid that slammed into Earth 65 million years ago, probably killing the dinosaurs. About 350 near-Earth asteroids have been found. Scientists carefully map the orbits of those asteroids. They say those asteroids will not hit Earth anytime soon. However, one might hit someday, scientists say. There may be another 1,000 near-Earth asteroids scientists haven't discovered. Scientists worry that one of the unknown asteroids might threaten Earth. Scientists will use the information they gathered from Eros to protect Earth from asteroids that come too close to the third rock from the sun."	4
Last month, water flooded the ancient city of Zeugma in Turkey. Turkey is a country in the Middle East. During the summer, Turkish officials had opened a dam, which led to the flood. The water poured into the city at the rate of a foot a day. Parts of Zeugma were built 2,300 years ago. Ancient artists had painted scenes of daily life on many of the city's buildings. The rising water threatened to destroy the ancient art. More than 250 scientists sprang into action to save the art. They carefully took down some of the art-covered walls and carried them to safety. They saved many art treasures, which they plan to study to learn more about ancient Turkey.	4
"When you come home from school, does your pet dog run to you barking and wagging its tail? Does your cat purr when you pet it? Many pet owners believe that tail wagging and purring are signs that pets are happy. Most scientists are not sure that animals feel emotions. They say animals never feel happy or sad. In fact, they say, animals probably don't feel love, anger, hate or other emotions either. Scientist Joseph LeDoux studied rats to find out whether the rodents have emotions. He found that rats do feel at least one emotion--fear. He also found the part of the brain that seems to control fear in rats. In humans, that part of the brain controls fear and some other emotions. Even though LeDoux says rats feel fear, he doubts that other animals have emotions in the way humans and other primates do. ""A whale may behave as if it's in love,"" he said, ""but you can't prove what it's feeling, if anything."" A number of scientists say animals do have a range of emotions. Some scientists who have studied such animals as dogs, cats, elephants, lions, and whales say those animals feel emotions. Scientist Joyce Poole studies elephants. She has written that pachyderms often show grief when a relative dies. She says elephants have ""deep emotions."" More recently, scientist Marc Bekoff watched an elk run back and forth through a patch of snow, jumping into the air as it completed each back-and-forth pass. Bekoff said the animal was feeling the ""joy of life."" Bekoff said he can't prove that animals have feelings, because animals can't talk. But, he said, animals can communicate feelings in other ways. ""I can't prove that another human being is feeling happy or sad,"" he said, ""but I can [guess] how [he or she is] feeling through body language and facial expressions."" Both people and animals use body language-- gestures and movements--to communicate without words."	4
Many pet owners say their dogs communicate through body language. Knowing animal body language could help you know how to act around an unfamiliar animal. An angry dog bares its teeth and barks. Its ears are up, and its tail is held out. The dog looks directly at the person or the animal it is angry with.	4
"When you run hard and play hard, you may have trouble catching your breath. Some kids, however, lose their breath even when they're not running or playing. Those kids have asthma, a disease that makes it hard to breathe. For many years, scientists have known that cigarette smoke, dog and cat dander, dust mites, and cockroaches can trigger asthma attacks. Dander is tiny bits of fur and skin. Now scientists have added a new culprit to that list--mouse dander. Scientists studied dust samples from 608 U.S. homes with children ages 4 to 9 who suffered from asthma. The scientists found many things in the dust, including evidence of mice. About 95 percent of the homes had at least one room that had mouse dander. The scientists then tested the kids in each of the homes to see if mouse dander triggered asthma attacks in them. The dander triggered attacks in 18 out of every 100 kids. As a result of those tests, Dr. Robert Wood of Johns Hopkins University concluded that mice trigger many asthma attacks. In fact, he said, the ""mouse is second in line [after the cockroach in causing asthma attacks]."" Mouse dander was found in many of the houses, even though not all of them had mice. Sometimes, kids tracked dander from mice and other animals into their homes when they came in from outside. Sometimes, the dander was from mice that had been in the home in the past. Daniel, who lives in Clarksville, Maryland, suffers from asthma. Last year, scientists collected and studied dust from his home. The scientists found cat dander in the dust, even though his family didn't own a cat. It was cat dander that was triggering Daniel's asthma attacks, said Daniel's doctor. To keep cat dander out of their home, Daniel and his mother frequently wash the floors, walls, and other surfaces. As a result, Daniel's mother said Daniel hasn't had an asthma attack in the last year."	4
"Cecil may be only 7 years old, but he has already sung in a theater in New York City. The funny thing is, Cecil is a dog. He recently beat out 300 other pets to win the Search for North America's Best Singing Pet contest, held by Advantage, a company that makes flea control products. To win, Cecil and owner Bill Hagemann performed a duet. The two sang a song called ""Mr. Moon."" After being announced as the winner, Cecil sang an encore, ""Give My Regards to Broadway."" Cecil won a year's supply of flea control products, a chance to appear in a TV commercial, and $1,000 in cash. The dog and his owner also won a recording session in a recording studio."	4
"One of the many products made by child laborers are bidis. Recently, many people in the United States have started smoking the cigarettes, which come in candy flavors. They think the candy-flavored cigarettes are safer than other cigarettes. They're dead wrong. The cigarettes, called bidis (BEE-dees), come in colorful boxes and in different flavors, such as chocolate, grape, and strawberry. Michael Eriksen, of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said bidis ""are candy-flavored and cost less [than other cigarettes], so they appeal to some kids."" Bidis are not candy. They actually contain even more deadly poisons than other kinds of cigarettes. The American Lung Association says bidis contain five times more tar and eight times more nicotine than other cigarettes. Tar is a chemical that causes disease. Nicotine is a drug that makes people crave cigarettes. Health experts also say people who smoke bidis have to puff longer and harder than they do with other cigarettes. That means smokers breathe in more poisons. In every state, it is illegal for kids to buy cigarettes, including bidis. The U.S. government has also banned the importing of bidis because child laborers often make them. The laws, however, are being broken. Recently, a group of kids in Oregon went undercover to help the police. The kids, ages 8 to 15, were able to buy bidis in some stores. Health experts say the best way to stop kids from using cigarettes is to give kids the facts about how deadly cigarettes are. Another way to keep kids from smoking ""is to get adults to quit, because they are the biggest role model for kids,"" said health expert Greg Conley. 1. Lungs -- Smoking kills parts of the lungs that allow a person to breathe. It causes illnesses, such as bronchitis and emphysema. 2. Heart -- Smoking blocks vessels carrying blood to and from the heart. It can also lead to heart attacks."	4
"In some parts of the world, people have to learn how to deal with natural disasters. In Los Angeles, California, people cope with earthquakes. In Hawaii, people deal with volcanoes. And in southeastern France, people fear herds of wild pigs. In France, the critters are called sanglochons. The animals are a cross between a wild boar (sanglier) and a domestic pig (cochon). The pigs are eating everything they can find. ""The other night I was woken up by a strange noise,"" said Christian Deschamps, who lives in France. ""I went outside, taking my dog with me as a precaution, and found a sow [a female pig] and her piglets eating my lawn."" Marcel Laugier, a local wildlife officer, said, ""They're everywhere. It's like a plague. They come into areas and dig through bins and dig up lawns and drink out of swimming pools. I get a constant stream of calls from people complaining about them."" To solve the problem, officials in France are now trying to control the pig population through hunting. Officials hope that fewer pigs will cause fewer problems for the people of France."	4
"When a meteor hits the ground, it is called a meteorite. When a meteor is in space, it is called a meteoroid. People more than 100 miles away saw the bright light. Most observers didn't know what had caused the flash. Some thought they had seen a strange new airplane or even a flying saucer. Frank So, an astronomer, is fairly sure he knows what caused the flash. ""From the description, it sounds like a very bright meteor,"" said So, who works at the Griffith Observatory in Los Angeles. California. A meteor is a rock from space that people see as a streak of light as it hurtles through Earth's atmosphere. A meteor is also called a shooting star. About 100 million meteors pass through Earth's atmosphere each year."	4
"Bob Simon is a cross between Indiana Jones and the Nutty Professor. For most of his life, Simon worked as an engineer, someone who designs and builds buildings, bridges, and other structures. But recently Simon traded in his old job for a new one--as a dinosaur hunter. Simon, who says he loves dinosaurs, started a new business called Dinosaur Safaris. He takes people on dinosaur digs in Wyoming. Simon hopes that he can earn money with his company. ""If I could make a living doing this,"" he said, ""that'd be awesome."" Simon is not the only fossil hunter who has given up another job in the hope of making a living finding fossils. Other people have started businesses in which they look for fossils. All of them hope to make a big find, which might mean big bucks. A Tyrannosaurus rex fossil recently sold for $1 million!"	4
If you think you are too old to sit in a booster seat when you ride in a car, think again. According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), all kids who weigh less than 80 pounds and are less than 57 inches tall should sit in a booster seat with a seat belt. You can learn more about booster seats, seat belts, and car safety at the NHTSA's Web site, www.nhtsa.dot.gov	4
This year's survey shows that fourth graders are carrying an average 7.9 pounds in their school backpacks. Last year's survey revealed that fourth graders lugged an average 7.5 pounds in their packs. This year's backpack survey uncovered some shocking backpack weights. Some kids are carrying up to 25 pounds in their packs. One kid said he carried 63 pounds in his knapsack! Doctors say that today more kids than ever before are complaining of back problems. Some of those back problems are caused by overloaded backpacks. Doctors say kids should not carry backpacks heavier than 10 to 15 percent of their body weight. A 70-pound fourth grader, for example, should not carry a pack that weighs more than 7 to 10.5 pounds. According to the survey, most fourth graders are within that range.	4
"The officers have started Buckle Up for Bucks, a program that rewards people who wear their seat belts. Officers reward people who wear seat belts by handing out doughnuts and raffle tickets for savings bonds. ""It works,"" said police officer John Janulewicz. ""If we can get them [people] in the habit of buckling up, it will reduce injuries."" The police say the number of people who wear seat belts has gone up by 10 percent."	4
Election Day is only a couple of weeks away, and the presidential candidates are very busy. They are traveling around the United States asking people to vote for them in the presidential election. George W. Bush agreed to answer questions about himself in writing. Here's what he had to tell the kids of the United States. George W. Bush: My parents [are my heroes] because they gave me unconditional love when I was growing up. They were great role models for raising my own daughters. Bush: American and European history [were my favorites]. I believe that understanding the past helps us better understand and deal with situations happening in today's world. Bush: I think life was simpler when I was a kid growing up in a small west Texas town called Midland. We were outdoors a lot--riding our bicycles everywhere, playing sports, swapping baseball cards, going to barbecues in each other's backyards. Everyone in the neighborhood looked out for each other, and if you did something wrong, then your friend's mom or dad--even the school football coach--would call you on it. WR: Your father, George Bush, was president. What is it like to have a former president as a dad? Bush: My father is a wonderful role model and a loving dad, and his example has inspired me in many ways. My father taught me to appreciate and learn from history. By studying the careers of talented Americans who entered government, I learned that dedicated public servants can help people.	4
Ten years ago, a space shuttle roared into space on a special mission. The astronauts' mission was to put the Hubble Space Telescope in orbit 380 miles above Earth, where it can take better photos of planets, stars, and galaxies than telescopes on Earth can. During the last decade, Hubble has taken thousands of photos. Many of them have helped scientists learn more about the universe we live in. The photo shows the Eagle Nebula, a huge cloud of gas in the constellation Serpens. The bright reddish stars that recently formed out of the material that makes up the nebula. Last December, astronauts worked on the Hubble Space Telescope to repair it and make it even better. Scientists hope the telescope will help them make more amazing discoveries.	4
"Many kids think cell phones are cool. The portable phones come in fun colors and let you chat with friends anytime and anywhere. For many kids, owning the right cell phone is just as important as wearing the coolest sneakers or latest style of jeans. Even though cell phones are a hot fad, some scientists are ringing an alarm about them. The scientists say that cell phones might pose a health threat. In the United States, more than 90 million people use cell phones. Many of those people are kids. For kids, cell phones are about more than phone calls, says Anne Charlton of the University of Manchester in England. ""It's all about the cool factor,"" Charlton said. She added that a cell phone is not just about making calls, it's also a fashion statement. Most cell phone users don't think about the health risks the phones might pose. Some scientists warn that cell phones give off radiation that might be harmful to users. One recent study shows that cell phone radiation might increase a person's chance of getting some kinds of cancer. Other medical experts say cell phones don't pose a health threat. They point to studies that have not found any link between phone use and cancer. Scientists say that people can protect themselves from cell phone radiation. One way is to use a headset instead of talking directly into a cell phone. Or, for an even simpler solution, people can make shorter calls. When the first cell phones were sold, they all had the same ring. Today, most cell phones can be made to ring one of several different tones. But at least one cell phone manufacturer plans to change that. Nokia plans to start making phones that play pop tunes when they ring. Users could choose tunes by the Spice Girls, Enrique Iglesias, Lenny Kravitz, and many other artists."	4
"Kids who live in the United States are changing, according to the U.S. census. Sure, kids are getting taller, stronger, and faster as they grow up. But they are changing in another way, too--U.S. kids are more diverse, or different in background, than ever before. The graph shows percentages of people living in the U.S. from some ethnic groups. The figures add up to more than 100% because some people said they were from more than one ethnic group and were counted more than once. Every ten years, the U.S. government counts all the people who live in the United States. The count is called the census. Recently, the government began releasing some of the information it learned from the 2000 census. The census counted 281.4 million people in the United States. More than 72 million of those people are kids under age 18. That means that about 26 out of every 100 people are kids! The census also showed that U.S. kids are more ethnically diverse than ever before. That means that today's kids have ancestors who came from a greater variety of foreign countries. ""The nation is more diverse in the year 2000 than it was in 1990, when the last census was taken,"" said Jorge del Pinal of the U.S. Census Bureau. The percentage of minorities, or people who are not part of the largest ethnic group, increased from 24 percent to 31 percent of the total U.S. population. Much of that minority increase is due to immigration to the United States, the census reported. One in five kids has at least one parent who moved to this country from another country. Del Pinal added that kids are more diverse than their parents because the number of marriages between people of different races is four times higher than it was in 1990. Two out of every five kids are part of at least one minority group. Nearly 3 million kids have parents who have different ethnic backgrounds. For example, one parent may be from Asia and another from Europe."	4
Children's Express (CE) is a news service started 25 years ago. It produces stories by kid reporters. CE has won several awards, including Emmy, Peabody, and Casey awards. It has even been nominated for a Pulitzer Prize. The nearly 700 kid reporters who work for CE come up with the story ideas, research the stories, and write the stories. Their stories have appeared in newspapers and on radio news broadcasts. CE's main office is in Washington, D.C. It has news bureaus, or branches of its news service, in New York City and Marquette, Michigan. CE news bureaus are also located in England. Bureaus are scheduled to open soon in Northern Ireland and Japan. CE also plans to open bureaus in Germany, South Africa, and Vietnam.	4
"People in some states pay a deposit when they buy bottles and cans of soft drinks. When they return the empty bottles and cans to a redemption center, they get their deposits back. Now some lawmakers in Maine want people to pay a 5-cent deposit on each cigarette they buy. If the bill passes, people could return used cigarette butts to get a deposit back. The lawmakers who introduced the bill say they did so for two reasons. First, such a plan would lead to fewer crushed cigarette butts littering the landscape. ""I think [the law] could work to reduce waste,"" said Maine lawmaker Scott Cowger, who cosponsored the bill in Maine's House of Representatives. Second, a cigarette deposit law would raise money for antismoking education programs in Maine schools. The bill's sponsors admit they expect only a small percentage of people will redeem cigarette butts. But those nickel deposits that aren't redeemed could add up to as much as $50 million for school antismoking programs. Some people in Maine have problems with the cigarette deposit bill. Annie Loadwick, of Mercer, Maine, runs a bottle and can redemption center. She said she doesn't want to have to handle and count customer's used cigarette butts. Maine's governor, Angus King, also does not support the bill. He wants instead to place a tax on cigarettes of 26 cents per pack. The tax, King said, would produce up to $36 million for school antismoking programs."	4
Last month, Weekly Reader reported on a bill that would impose a 5-cent deposit on cigarettes sold in Maine. Members of a committee in the Maine legislature recently voted to snuff out the bill, making it unlikely that the bill will become law. If the bill had become law, it would have increased the cost of a pack of cigarettes by $1. State Rep. Joseph Brooks, who introduced the bill, said he was disappointed by the vote. Brooks had proposed the bill to cut down on litter and to raise money to pay for antismoking education programs in Maine's schools. He also had hoped that the increased cost would have caused some smokers to stop smoking cigarettes.	4
Weekly Reader: What were the most important accomplishments of your presidency? President Bill Clinton: I think that one of the most important things I've accomplished was helping to strengthen our economy so that more Americans have jobs and more families can afford to buy homes and send their kids to college. I'm particularly proud of a new program created in 1993 called AmeriCorps, which gives young people a chance to serve their communities while earning money for college. WR: What advice would you give the new president? Clinton: A president has tremendous responsibilities-- from keeping our economy growing to working with foreign leaders and commanding our armed forces. The president is the leader, but he or she can't do the job alone. So my advice is build a strong team, stay focused on your priorities, and make every day count. WR: Why should kids be proud to be Americans? Clinton: We should all be proud to be Americans because this truly is a land of opportunity. Regardless of your background, you can work hard and achieve your dreams. You may face challenges or obstacles along the way, but if you set your sights high, work hard, and stick to your priorities, you can achieve your goals. WR: What has been the best part of being president? Clinton: The best part of being president has been having the opportunity to make America a better place. Every day, I have the chance to make a difference in people's lives. WR: After being president for eight years, what will you do now? Clinton: The first lady and I recently bought a new home in Chappaqua, N.Y., and I look forward to spending more time there. I also plan to spend time in Arkansas putting together my presidential library and launching a new public policy center. I'm sure I'll be very busy, but I also hope to spend more time with my family and friends and to simply relax after what has been eight of the most incredible years of my life.	4
"A condor's wingspan is 9.5 feet across. That's about as wide as two kids lying down head to toe. Wildlife experts say the condors did not die from the heat. Instead, the experts believe the huge birds died from lead poisoning. They say the condors had swallowed lead shotgun pellets. Condors are scavengers, which means they eat the remains of dead animals. The condors probably ate the remains of an animal that had been shot by a hunter. As they ate the dead animal's flesh, the birds ate the deadly pellets. If swallowed, lead can make an animal sick or cause death. Lead stops the body from making red blood cells. It can also damage an animal's organs, including the brain and liver. The five poisoned birds were among 35 condors that have been released in Arizona since 1996. The release program has cost millions of dollars. After the dead condors were found, wildlife experts recaptured and tested the 16 birds left in the Arizona group. All the birds were healthy and were soon released. Members of the Peregrine Fund have been releasing and watching the condors set free in Arizona. Jeff Cilek, of the Peregrine Fund, told Weekly Reader that saving California condors is important. ""Condors are good for the environment. They [eat] dead animals,"" Cilek said. California condors are among the world's largest birds. A hundred years ago, the birds were found in many parts of the United States. Today, the condor is on the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service's list of endangered species. That means the number of California condors is so low they all could disappear someday. Peregrine Fund officials say there are 150 California condors left on Earth. Forty-eight of those birds are living in the wild; the rest are in zoos. Although the loss of five birds is a ""serious setback,"" Cilek said his group is looking to the future. Peregrine Fund officials recently announced plans to release 12 more California condors in Arizona this winter."	4
For years, scientists have known about a group of icy objects, called centaurs, in our solar system. They circle the sun between the orbits of Saturn and Uranus. Scientists thought centaurs were made of ice and were almost completely smooth. But recent photos of one of those objects, named Asbolus 8405, are proving scientists wrong. Rather than finding a smooth surface, scientists discovered a crater near one end of Asbolus 8405. And centaurs are not made entirely of ice, either. Scientists saw material inside the crater that did not look like frozen water. Some scientists now say centaurs are made of a mixture of water, methane, and ammonia ice. Asbolus 8405 formed when the solar system first formed, scientists say. They hope that the object will help them learn more about what the solar system was like when it first formed.	4
"One night in March, Daniel Calderone, age 12, was doing his homework in his California home. Then the lights went out, and he knew he wouldn't finish his assignment. Many Californians have had similar problems. Since December, power companies have had trouble meeting the demand for electricity in the Sunshine State. In January and March, more than a million Californians sweated through rolling blackouts, which happen when power companies turn off electricity in an area for a short time. Several factors contributed to the shortage, said Lawrence J. Makovich, a scientist who studies energy use. One problem is that California doesn't have enough power plants to supply all the electricity the Sunshine State needs. In addition, prices have risen for the fuels used in power plants to produce electricity, Makovich said. The energy crisis may become worse this summer as Californians turn on air conditioners. According to Sen. Dianne Feinstein of California, the state will probably be 10 percent short of the amount of electricity it needs. This summer, the electricity crunch may spread to other parts of the country. In some areas, prices for electricity have been on the rise. Many states are taking steps to solve the shortage. In California, Gov. Gray Davis is urging people to save energy. ""Yes, we have a power shortage, but we are far from powerless,"" Davis said. ""By reducing our electricity demand by even a small amount, we can reduce the price, avoid shortages, and lower energy bills."""	4
"Larry Stevens lives in a remote, quiet area of Hawaii. Recently, that changed when new neighbors moved into the area. The noisy neighbors are two kinds of frogs. Even though the coqui and greenhouse frogs are each only about the size of a dime, they make a huge racket. Instead of making soft chirping or gentle croaking sounds, the frogs chirp as loudly as a lawnmower. ""You'd never believe so much noise could come from a creature that small,"" Stevens said. Scientists say the frogs in Stevens's backyard recently arrived in Hawaii. They came from islands in the Caribbean Sea, south of the United States mainland. Scientists think the frogs were accidentally shipped to Hawaii in flowerpots. Since arriving in Hawaii, the foreign frogs have spread to 150 areas. In some areas, more than 8,000 can be found on a single acre of land. Each one is adding to the noise level. The frogs are more than a noisy nuisance; they are causing other problems, as well. They eat insects that birds and other frogs used to eat. Each night, each thunderous frog can eat at least six insects. The number of frogs is increasing because no other animals prey on them. If the foreign frog population keeps growing, other frogs and birds in Hawaii might not have enough insects to eat and might starve. Some officials worry that the frogs might cause some people to leave Hawaii because of the racket. ""We get a lot of complaints from residents,"" said Fred Kraus, a spokesperson for the state. ""Some [have] threatened to leave the state."" Residents of Hawaii are trying to capture the shrill frogs, which live in trees. Recently, Stevens and some of his neighbors went out looking for the noisy critters. They used ladders to climb into trees and capture frogs. ""We got them all,"" he said. However, within a few months of the frog roundup, more frogs moved into Stevens's neighborhood. ""It was hopeless,"" Stevens said. ""There were just too many [frogs to capture]. Now they're out of control."""	4
"Some kids walk to school. Other kids take a bus or are driven to school. Now, some kids simply log on to their computers to go to school. Those kids attend cyberschools,or online schools. Several U.S. states have started cyberschools. One company, K12, recently started a national cyberschool. K12's founder, William Bennett, believes that K12 and the Internet will give kids a new way to go to school. Bennett said, ""K12 will help connect parents, teachers, and children to one of the most effective educational [tools, the Internet]."" Bennett is not alone in thinking that the Internet can provide an alternative to traditional schools. Kathi Baldwin is a teacher at Valley Pathways, a cyberschool in Palmer, Alaska. She thinks cyberschools are as good as traditional schools. ""We wouldn't do it if we didn't think it could produce an equal education--or better [than traditional education],"" Baldwin said. Some critics say cyberschools are not as good as traditional schools. Michael Carr is a spokesperson for the National Association of Secondary Principals. He says kids who attend cyberschools don't have as many chances to make friends as other kids do. ""The main worry would be the socialization skills,"" he said. Lini Hamel, 15, and 400 other students attend the Western Pennsylvania Cyber Charter School (WPCCS). Lini loves the school. ""It has everything. I don't know how to describe it,"" said Lini. Douglas Meikle, 8, is disabled and cannot attend a traditional school. Each morning, the third grader uses a computer in his house to sign on to WPCCS. Then Douglas downloads his assignments. He works with teachers over the computer to complete each assignment. His mother says that the cyberschool has changed Douglas's life. Aaron Smith, 16, also attends WPCCS. One of the things he likes best about the school is its flexibility. ""You get to work at your own pace,"" he said. ""I don't have to wake up at any certain time. It's just more fun."""	4
"Scientists working in Argentina are finding larger and larger dinosaurs. About a dozen years ago, they discovered Argentinosaurus, a plant eater that was longer than three school buses placed end to end. Now, a scientist says he has uncovered an even larger plant eater. Jorge Calvo is leading the team of paleontologists, scientists who study fossils, who found the giant plant eater. Calvo says the newly discovered dinosaur lived 87 million years ago, stood 52 feet tall, was 130 feet long, and weighed 100 tons. ""It would be safe to say, this is the biggest [dinosaur],"" said Calvo. The giant plant eater is not the only dinosaur fossil that scientists have recently found in Argentina. Scientists have discovered an area that stretches for hundreds of miles and is loaded with dinosaur fossils. So far, they have found four previously unknown dinosaur species in the area. The Age of the Dinosaurs began about 225 million years ago and ended 65 million years ago. Scientists divide that huge period of time into three shorter periods, called the Triassic Period, the Jurassic Period, and the Cretaceous Period. The first dinosaurs probably developed about halfway through the Triassic Period. Different dinosaurs lived in each of those three periods. The dinosaurs discovered in Argentina date from the Jurassic Period. Paleontologists don't yet know much about the dinosaurs that lived during the Jurassic Period. ""Jurassic Period fossils are very, very rare,"" said scientist Gerardo Cladera. During the Jurassic Period, Earth's temperature was warmer than it is today. The warmer temperature caused glaciers to melt and the sea level to rise. The oceans flooded much of the land, leaving little land area where dinosaur fossils could be preserved. Calvo's newly discovered dinosaur stood taller than a three-story-high tree. Despite its size, the towering plant eater was preyed on by Giganotosaurus, the largest known meat eater. It stood 12 feet tall, had large, serrated teeth, and hunted in packs. The giant plant eater would have been no match for a pack of hungry giganotosaurs. ""By working as a team, these predators would be able to eat even a giant plant eater,"" explained paleontologist Thomas Holtz."	4
People in India are rebuilding their homes and lives after a powerful earthquake rocked a western section of their country on January 26. Indian officials say that the quake, which had a magnitude of 7.7, may have killed as many as 25,000 people. The quake, which was the strongest to hit India in 50 years, left devastation and heartache in its wake. Initially, rescue workers had little hope of finding survivors under rubble from toppled buildings. However, miraculous rescues did occur. For example, a rescue team saved a 4-year-old girl trapped under tons of concrete several days after the quake had struck. Disaster experts say that the quake caused more than $5 billion in damage. It will take years for the people affected by the disaster to recover from it.	4
"Construction workers in Rome, Italy, recently dug up the ruins of an ancient poet's house. While digging a trash dump, the workers discovered the house that belonged to Ovid, a poet who lived about 2,000 years ago. Ovid lived in a house, or villa, located on the banks of the Tiber River. Many of his poems and letters are about his villa. Just as Ovid was becoming a great poet, he offended the emperor of Rome and was forced to leave his beloved villa for a distant city. While he was away, he wrote nostalgic letters about his home. Scientists are amazed by the discovery. ""By itself, the villa is a notable finding, but it acquires even more value because it is the place where one of the greatest poets in Rome lived,"" explained Gaetano Messineo, one of the scientists at the dig. City officials in Rome plan to put up a building around Ovid's ancient villa to protect it. But the area will not look as it did in Ovid's time. A dump and a four-lane highway now block the views of the Tiber River that Ovid wrote about in his poetry."	4
"At the Renaissance Hotel in Chicago, Illinois, every dog has its day...and night. Recognizing that people like to travel with their pets, the hotel decided to allow pets to stay as overnight guests. The hotel even created a pet menu. The special menu has pets licking their chops. For dogs, the hotel serves braised beef and fresh vegetables on rice pilaf, or scrambled eggs with cheese and potato hash. Both meals come in a doggie dish. Cats can also get a purr-fectly delicious meal. They can nibble tuna fish tossed with chopped egg and sour cream, or scrambled eggs and poached salmon. The pet dinners are similar to the dinners the restaurant serves its human guests. ""People could eat all of the food,"" said hotel chef Michael Reich. ""I was just saying today, wouldn't it be funny if someone walked in and said, 'I want the doggie pot roast'?"""	4
A team of six Portuguese water dogs helped the San Francisco Giants every time the baseball team played at home at Pacific Bell Park. The dogs are members of the Baseball Aquatic Retrieval Korps (BARK). They retrieved home run baseballs hit into nearby McCovey Cove. BARK uses Portuguese water dogs because they are excellent swimmers. The dogs have webbed feet and use their tails as rudders. Portuguese fishermen use these swimming hounds to herd schools of fish into nets and deliver messages between ships. A local animal shelter, Pets In Need, auctioned the balls that Rio, Shadow, Topper, Surfer, Kyma, and Justy retrieved. The money is used to help other animals at the shelter.	4
"Now that you have an escape plan, get your family together to practice it. Join families across the U.S. and Canada in practicing ""The Great Escape"" on October 11, 2000, at 7:00 p.m. You'll be part of the world's largest fire drill! Better yet, you and your family will know exactly what to do if there is ever a fire in your home. Test your doors and windows. They must all open easily so that you can get out easily. Are there any boxes, toys, or pieces of furniture blocking your escape path? Move them out of the way! Make sure all smoke alarms are working by pushing the test buttons. Note: Newer smoke alarms have a universal signal repetition pattern of three beeps, followed by a one and a half second pause. Start your home fire escape drill by assigning one member of the family to push the test button on your smoke alarm. When you hear the alarm, spring into action! Feel around the door frame and the space between the door and frame with the back of your hand. Is it warm? For the first run through of your drill, pretend that it's not warm.

Governor Bush wants the nation's military forces to fight people who sneak drugs into the United States from other countries. He also wants people who are caught selling or using drugs to spend more time in jail. Vice President Gore wants to create new government programs to help people stop using drugs. He also wants to create more courts and tougher punishments to fight the people who sell drugs.	4
You know the planets in our solar system. Name them quickly--Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune, and Pluto. But how about JL55 and ION1999? Those are the names of two of nine planets scientists say they recently discovered outside our solar system. Scientists working in Switzerland spotted six of the newly discovered planets. American scientists discovered the other three planets. So far, the scientists have not seen the planets. Instead, they have seen nine distant stars wobble. Scientists know that as a planet orbits a star, it causes the star to wobble. The discoveries bring the number of known planets outside our solar system to 50. Scientists say the discoveries increase the chances that life might exist elsewhere in the universe. They say some of those planets might be similar to Earth.	4
On Labor Day, many families have barbecues. Hamburgers are usually part of a barbecue menu. But something else may be on some barbecue menus: tiny germs called E. coli. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) says that each year, E. coli germs make as many as 20,000 people sick, and kill some people. The germs are often found in raw hamburger meat. Most people who are made ill by E. coli get bad stomachaches that can last for a week.	4
"Vice President Al Gore recently told Weekly Reader that his parents, Senator Albert Gore Sr. and Pauline LaFon Gore, were his heroes ""because of everything they did for our country."" Gore still remembers the last words that his father, who died several years ago, said to him: ""Son, always do right."" Al Gore was born in Washington, D.C. on March 31, 1948. As a child, he spent part of his time in Washington, where his father was a U.S. senator. During summer vacations, Al often had to live with family friends in Tennessee while his parents were in Washington. At those times, the house he stayed in didn't have indoor plumbing, he said. When Al was in Tennessee, he worked hard on his family's farm. He baled hay, worked with farm animals, and cleared farmland of trees and rocks. Gore said that he liked to work hard and help out even when he was supposed to be having fun. When he was 9 years old, Al went to a 4-H camp. At camp, he volunteered to work in the kitchen and do the work that was usually given to older boys. ""He was the only camper I ever had volunteer for K-P, or kitchen duty,"" said Jerry Cole, a local 4-H representative. Although he worked hard, Al also knew how to have a good time. When his parents weren't looking, he recalled, he would sometimes move all the furniture in the living room to make a fort. Because Al's father was a senator, he got to meet some important people. When Al was 5 years old, he met then Vice President Richard Nixon. ""He put me on his knee and was very nice to me,"" Gore remembered. Today, as vice president, Gore is still working hard. And now his goal is to become president of the United States. The 11 kids in the fourth-grade classroom burst out laughing when they turned to look at George W. Bush. George, a class clown, had used a pen to draw a beard on his face. The teacher didn't find George's prank funny. She marched him to the principal's office. The principal, Mr. Bizilo, punished George by spanking him with a paddle. Born on July 6, 1946, in New Haven, Connecticut, George moved to Texas with his family about two years later. As a child, George dreamed of becoming a baseball player. ""All George ever wanted to be was a major-league baseball player,"" said classmate Terry Throckmorton. ""That's all he ever talked about."" He also collected baseball cards. When George was 10 years old, he began mailing baseball cards to the players pictured on them. He asked the players to sign the cards and return them to him. Many of the best players of the time autographed his cards. George's teachers remember that he was a good student. ""He was a good, well-rounded young man, and he did his work,"" said George's third-grade teacher, Austine Crosby. When George was in seventh grade, his classmates remember that he ran against Jack Hanks for class president. Today, his classmates claim that George won the election. ""I voted for George because he was cuter,"" remembered classmate Peggy Porter Weiss. Bush went on to run in other elections. The people of Texas twice elected him their governor. He is now running for president of the United States."	4
"""Americans have a common interest in protecting our natural lands. As president, I will speak for that great national goal."" George W. Bush wants to establish a national award to recognize people who help the environment. He also wants to give money to help landowners protect rare species and wants to set up private land preserves. Al Gore wants to build new kinds of cars, trucks, and other machines that cause less air pollution. He also wants to start programs that will help end global warming and help protect endangered species."	4
"Every December, certain beaches and islands along the West Coast of the United States and Mexico fill with the sights and sounds of elephant seals. Visitors can't miss the huge animals, which make as much noise as a pack of motorcycles. Until recently, however, those beaches were quieter because elephant seals were almost extinct. But in the last few years, the seals have made one of the most amazing comebacks of any animal. Nearly a century ago, only 100 elephant seals were left in the wild. Hunters had killed the animals for their blubber, or fat, which was used to make lamp oil to light people's homes. In addition, their skins were often used for clothing. In 1972, the U.S. government passed a law protecting elephant seals. Now, because of that law, more than 150,000 of the seals live in the wild. Elephant seals spend much of the year swimming in the Pacific Ocean, far from shore. The seals are looking for food, such as fish and squid. They can swim about 35 miles from shore and dive as deep as 5,000 feet below the ocean surface to search for food. (That's about as deep as a whale can dive!) By December, elephant seals head for beaches in California and Mexico. They hit the beaches to mate and raise their young. When male elephant seals, called bulls, haul themselves out of the water, they can weigh as much as 4,500 pounds, or two small cars. The world's largest colony of elephant seals spends the winter at the Año Nuevo State Reserve in California. As many as 5,000 elephant seals spend the winter there. Visitors to the reserve can see the giant seals. One visitor said the animals are ""a cross between a beanbag and a Volkswagen bug."" However, visitors have to watch out for the giant animals. Seals may look fat and slow, but they anger quickly and can move 20 feet in two seconds. One way scientists have learned about elephant seals is by attaching radios to the backs of the animals. The radios send out signals. The radios have helped scientists learn how far and how deep elephant seals swim."	4
"On the morning of January 13, a powerful earthquake rattled El Salvador, a country in Central America. The earthquake was so powerful that people in Mexico City, more than 1,000 miles away, felt the ground shake. Officials in El Salvador said more than 700 people were killed and many people were still missing days after the quake. Thousands of homes were damaged or destroyed. As a result, many people were left without shelter. San Salvador, the nation's capital, was the scene of terrible destruction. Much of the damage was caused by mudslides that buried many buildings. To help the survivors of the earthquake, dozens of countries, including Japan, Spain, and the United States, rushed teams of rescue workers to El Salvador. The rescuers searched for people buried under mud and rubble from collapsed buildings. To clear the wreckage, rescue workers used bulldozers, shovels, and their hands. Rescuers also used specially trained dogs, which have a keen sense of smell, to locate victims buried by the quake. Thick layers of mud made rescue work difficult. ""Mud seals off everything considered essential for survival, such as oxygen,"" explained Gary O'Shea, director of the International Rescue Corps of the United Kingdom. In addition to sending teams of rescue workers, many countries sent money, food, clothing, water, and medical supplies to help in the recovery efforts. (Ask your teacher how you can help the earthquake victims in El Salvador.) The Earth's crust is made up of huge segments of rock called plates. (Some plates are as big as a continent. Some are as small as a city.) The area where two plates meet is called a fault. The plates on either side of a fault push against each other. Sometimes, the plates get stuck. When that happens, pressure builds up until one of the plates moves suddenly, releasing the built-up pressure and triggering an earthquake. The energy from the earthquake travels in waves through the Earth's crust. The crust is the outermost layer of Earth and is 6 to 40 miles thick. The United States Geological Survey (USGS) says earthquakes take place every day around the world. Most earthquakes are small, measuring less than 3.0 in magnitude. The El Salvador quake measured 7.6 in magnitude. (The higher the magnitude, the more intense the earthquake.) After the rescuers leave, the people of El Salvador will still be faced with a massive rebuilding effort. One young survivor, who had lost three sisters in the quake, looked at the devastation and said, ""It's like the world here is upside down."" The United States is no stranger to earthquakes. Early in the morning of January 17, thousands of New York City residents felt a small earthquake. Many people thought the quake was a subway train running beneath their buildings. ""But then I remembered that there isn't a subway line under my building,"" said one resident. The table shows the 10 largest earthquakes since 1900 as measured using the moment magnitude scale. The moment magnitude scale (Mw) measures the total energy released in an earthquake."	4
"For more than 12 years, violent conflict has plagued Azerbaijan (a-zuhr-bigh-JAHN), a country in southwest Asia between Iran and Russia. For much of that time, Azerbaijan has been fighting with neighboring Armenia. A few years ago, Farid said, ""I don't want to be a soldier when I grow up. I want to be a teacher."" Because of that desire for a peaceful life, Farid started the Child Peace Network. He sent out a petition to kids calling for peace between Azerbaijan and Armenia. So far, 10,000 kids from three countries have signed that petition. Azerbaijan and Armenia have been fighting over a region called Nagorno-Karabakh. Both countries claim the region belongs to them. Most of the people who live in that region are Armenian, and in 1988, the people of Nagorno-Karabakh began asking for independence or to join Armenia. In 1991, that request turned into a bloody conflict between the two countries. The fighting lasted until 1994, when a cease-fire was declared. Although the cease-fire continues, the two sides have not settled their differences, and fighting still breaks out. ""The war affects everyone in Azerbaijan,"" Elmira Suleymanova, Farid's grandmother, told Weekly Reader from her home in Baku, Azerbaijan. ""No one can feel safe. One night, an entire community was burned to the ground."" According to the U.N., the years of fighting have left 1 million people homeless. About 30 percent of those refugees are kids under age 15, said Farid. No one knows if Farid's petition has had an impact on the armed conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan. But last month, the leaders of the two countries met to discuss peace."	4
"Florida is the 23rd largest state in the United States. Key West is the southernmost part of the continental United States. Moving slowly and silently through more than a million acres of wetlands in Florida, water is the lifeblood of the Everglades. However, for the past few decades, the Everglades has been losing its lifeblood. President Bill Clinton plans to sign a new bill into law that may breathe new life into the Everglades. The bill is called the Everglades Restoration Act. The act will help restore parts of the Everglades to the way they were many years ago, say supporters. Critics of the plan say that it does not go far enough to restore the Everglades. The Everglades is like a shallow, slow-moving river that covers millions of acres. The ""river of grass,"" as the Everglades is called, is 50 miles wide and 120 miles long. It flows from Lake Okeechobee into Florida Bay. A large part of the river of grass is contained within the Everglades National Park. The park covers about 1.5 million acres (about the size of Delaware). Many plant and animal species, including alligators, panthers, egrets, and manatees live in the park. An alligator suns itself in the Everglades. Manatees, many kinds of birds, and panthers can be found in these wetlands. The Everglades Restoration Act will spend about $8 billion to restore the river of grass over the next 30 years. The act will be managed in part by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. One important part of the act calls for the removal of dams, dikes, and flood control gates. The Corps of Engineers began installing many of those devices in 1948 to control the flow of water in the Everglades. Those devices protect towns and farms from flooding and provide irrigation, or water for crops. By removing dams and closing canals, the Corps of Engineers will restore the flow of water in the river of grass to the way it was more than 100 years ago. That's when people first began to drain water from the Everglades. The act will also improve water treatment plants. Those plants clean wastewater coming from farms or towns near the Everglades. The improved plants will allow less water pollution to flow into the Everglades. The Corps of Engineers will also build reservoirs, relocate roads, and shut off drainage canals. Many people, from environmental groups to private citizens, applaud the act. ""This is as major a restoration as one would hope for,"" said Charles Lee, a spokesperson for the Florida Audubon Society. Critics of the plan, however, say it does not go far enough toward restoring the wetlands. For example, the Everglades once covered 9 million acres, say officials from the Sierra Club, an organization that works to protect the environment. The Corps of Engineers drained much of that land so it could be used as farmland and to build houses. More of that land should be returned to the way it used to be before the 20th century, Sierra Club officials have said. Whatever disagreements people may have, all agree that the restoration of the Everglades will take a long time and a lot of hard work. Once the act becomes law, said Stuart Applebaum of the Corps of Engineers, it will be time to ""roll up our sleeves [and get to work] for the next 30 years."""	4

"Our sun is a seething ball of hot gases. The sun is always active, but for the rest of this year, the sun will be more active than usual, scientists say. Activity on the sun can affect Earth. It can disrupt communications. It can also cause the northern lights, which are shifting curtains of colored light. When the sun is very active, dark spots, called sunspots, dot the sun's surface. Each day, scientists can see more than 100 sunspots on the sun. Sunspots slowly change shape and move across the sun's surface. Sunspots have a temperature of 7,000 degrees Fahrenheit (F). That might seem hot, but it is cooler than the rest of the sun's surface, which is a sweltering 10,000 degrees F. Because sunspots are cooler than the rest of the surface, they look dark--almost like shadows. When the sun is very active, huge explosions can rip across its surface. Those explosions, called flares, propel solar material into space. About three or four days after a flare erupts on the sun, the flare may collide with Earth's atmosphere. When a flare reaches Earth, it can damage satellites orbiting Earth, power stations, and electrical equipment. In July, a huge flare interfered with communication satellites. When solar flares reach our planet, they can make gases in Earth's atmosphere glow. The glowing gases form the northern lights. Weekly Reader senior editor Fran Downey once saw an aurora (the northern lights) while visiting Washington state. ""It began as a dull green light and got brighter and brighter, until it lit up the sky,"" Downey said. ""In the distance, I could hear coyotes howling at the aurora. It was beautiful."""	4
Scientists in Oregon have found a fantastic organism. No, it's not Big Foot. It's bigger. In fact, it's huge. It's a humongous fungus--the largest organism, or living thing, ever discovered. The giant fungus lives underground. As it grows, it spreads into tree roots. The only parts of the fungus that can be seen above the ground are mushrooms that grow at the base of infected trees. The fungus kills trees that it infects. So far, the fungus covers 2,200 acres. That's an area as big as 1,665 football fields! Scientists believe the fungus, which lives in the Malheur National Forest in Oregon, started growing 2,400 years ago.	4
"When Paul Glover goes to the store, he takes his own money. What's so unusual about that? Glover, who lives in Ithaca, New York, actually prints the money he spends at the store. Even though Glover pays for items with money the U.S. government didn't print, he's not breaking any laws. Glover's money is legal as long as it isn't passed off as official, or government approved money. Glover calls his money Ithaca Hours. About 500 stores and businesses in Ithaca accept Ithaca Hours in exchange for goods or services. Thousands of people in Ithaca now use the local money. One Ithaca Hour is worth $10, or an hour's worth of work. Half an Ithaca Hour is worth half as much, $5, or a half-hour of work. Glover said that he came up with the idea to help people find work. ""All my friends have a lot of skills that were not being used, and they had a lot of time,"" he said. Glover's idea has spread since he introduced it in 1991. People from New York to Hawaii now use their own local money instead of U.S.-issued money. At least 60 cities and towns in the United States have adopted their own local money systems."	4

The Great Barrier Reef off the coast of Australia is the largest marine park in the world. It covers about 135,100 square miles. Recently, the Australian government added another 386 miles to the park. Polyps live together in groups called colonies. As polyps die, they leave hard shells behind. Other polyps then live on top of the polyp shells. Over thousands of years, the polyp shells form a reef. The Great Barrier Reef acts as a barrier for the northeastern coast of Australia. The reef prevents waves from slamming into the coastline and eroding, or washing away, too much land. It also provides a home for fish and other animals, including the dugong, a large mammal. Reefs such as the Great Barrier Reef are under stress. Pollution and disease are killing the polyps, and tourists take pieces of coral. Reefs are also damaged by ships and fishing nets, which break off sections of coral. The damage is widespread, experts say. According to one report, by the World Resources Institute, more than half the world's reefs are at risk. The plant-eating dugong is a cousin of the manatee, or sea cow, which is found in the warm waters of Florida. The dugong lives in the Pacific and Indian oceans. The average dugong is about 9 feet long and weighs up to 600 pounds.	4

"Polar bears in Alaska are having trouble catching one of their main meals--ringed seals. To get to the seals, the bears often walk across islands of ice floating in the water. Ice throughout Alaska is melting earlier and faster in the spring than it did several years ago. So polar bears don't have as much time to catch seals before the ice melts. As a result, polar bears are catching fewer seals. Ice along Alaska's coast is melting because the temperature is higher worldwide. In the last 100 years, Earth's temperature has risen by 1 degree Fahrenheit. The rise in temperature is called global warming. Global warming is changing the environment worldwide. As a result, many plants and animals are being affected, say scientists from the World Wildlife Fund (WWF). Many plants and animals that can't adjust or migrate will not survive the rise in temperature, said WWF scientists. In some areas of the world, the WWF says, as many as two in ten species of plants and animals will die out by the year 2100. (1) The black guillemot (GIL-uh-maht) is a bird that lives on an island off Alaska's coast. It eats Arctic cod, a fish that lives in water under ice. Rising temperatures have caused much of the ice to melt. The Arctic cod has moved to other parts of the sea where water is still covered with ice. The guillemot no longer has enough fish to eat. (2) The American bistort is a plant that lives in Mount Rainier National Park. The Edith's checkerspot butterfly drinks nectar from bistort flowers. The warming temperatures have caused the butterflies to hatch earlier, before the flowers bloom, so the butterflies don't have enough food right after they hatch. (3) The Mexican vole lives in areas with warm temperatures. It is spreading northward into Arizona and Colorado because of the rise in temperatures there. (4) For years, red fire ants lived in the warm southern part of the United States. Today, because of rising temperatures, they are spreading northward. Scientists have learned that global warming is already affecting Earth. ""We should not expect the effects of global warming to take place 50 years in the future,"" said scientist Rafe Sagarin. ""It's happening right now."" Scientists agree that Earth has been getting warmer for the last 100 years. They don't agree on why it is getting warmer. Gases such as carbon dioxide cause global warming. Carbon dioxide in the air traps heat from the sun, causing Earth's temperature to rise. Volcanoes and forest fires release carbon dioxide into the air. Some scientists blame the rise in temperature on volcanic eruptions, forest fires, and other natural events. Other scientists blame human actions for the rise in temperature. They say Earth has always had volcanoes and forest fires, so why is Earth warming now? Those scientists say the carbon dioxide from automobiles and factories is causing the recent increase in global warming."	4

Officials had believed that the Great Wall was 4,160 miles long. But they recently discovered another 310-mile section of the wall at its western end. The wall now measures 4,470 miles long. That's equal to the distance from Miami, Florida, to the North Pole! Most of the wall is made of brick. The newly discovered section, however, is made of sandstone and branches. The Great Wall was originally built to protect China from invaders. It was built in sections and rebuilt many times. As many as three million people worked on the first section of the wall.	4
Whether you like ketchup on french fries, hamburgers, hot dogs, or eggs, the one thing that has remained the same is the color of the tasty condiment. Now one ketchup maker, the H. J.

"In 1970, only one in ten kids in the United States was overweight. In the 1980s, one-third of kids were overweight. In the 1990s, three-fifths of kids were overweight. A new study links the increase in the number of overweight kids to an increase in the amount of TV kids watch. ""We found that kids who were [light] TV watchers were [thinner]. The kids who were the fattest were those who watch a lot of TV,"" said Dr. Carlos Crespo. Crespo and Dr. Ross Anderson wrote the study. The doctors said kids today watch more TV than kids did 30 years ago. Today, one in three kids watches four or more hours of TV a day. Watching that much TV, they said, is unhealthful. According to the doctors, kids are not entirely to blame for watching too much TV. Part of the problem comes from a lack of safe places for kids to play. ""There are a certain number of hours in the day you're supposed to sleep [and] do your homework,"" said Crespo. ""You're supposed to go to school, and then there is a certain amount of hours that you are free to do whatever you want. If you spend that time watching TV, then you spend less time doing physical activity."""	4
"For 20 days in February and March, explosions and cannon fire blew up two huge statues located in Afghanistan, a country in Asia. The statues had been carved into the side of a cliff overlooking the Bamiyan Valley about 1,500 years ago. Many art and history experts say the statues were historic treasures. ""They were among the most stunning [statues] I've ever seen,"" said. Professor James Fisher of Carleton College in Minnesota. The Taliban, the religious group that rules most areas of Afghanistan, ordered the destruction of the two statues. (Taliban means ""seekers of the truth."") In 1996, the Taliban seized the Afghan capital, Kabul, and took control of most of the country. The Taliban and a large majority of people who live in the country are Muslims. They practice a religion called Islam. The Taliban said their holy book, the Koran, forbids the creation or worship of statues. Before the statues were destroyed, a Taliban leader said, ""Because... these statues are there to be worshipped, and that is wrong, they should be destroyed."" Throughout the world, leaders were outraged after learning that the Taliban planned the destruction of the huge statues. World leaders and officials from the United Nations (U.N.) tried to stop the destruction. Iran, a country where most people are Muslims, asked the Taliban not to blow up the statues. Japan, a country where Buddhism is widely practiced, threatened to withhold money that the country had planned to send to Afghanistan. Now many people are mourning the loss of the statues. ""It is [horrible] to witness the... destruction of [historic monuments], which were the [history] of the whole of humanity,"" said a U.N. representative."	4

The monument will honor some of America's heroes, the veterans who fought in World War II (1939-1945). U.S. veterans are people who have served in the U.S. military. Everyone agrees that the World War II monument is important, but some people say it will block the view from the Washington Monument to the Lincoln Memorial. They want the monument placed in another location to preserve that view. Bob Dole, a former senator and World War II veteran, disagrees with the critics of the monument. He wants to proceed with the construction of the new monument. He says the critics should be heard, however. ""That's what World War II was all about, [having] freedom of expression and...different views,"" Dole said."	4
In September, city officials in Punta Arenas, Chile, warned people to stay out of the sun. Chile is a country in South America. The warning didn't come just because it was a sunny day. The officials were worried because dangerous rays from the sun could have harmed people. The rays could have caused severe sunburns or skin cancer later in life. The photo shows the hole in the ozone layer above Antarctica. UV rays can harm people and animals. A hole in Earth's atmosphere allowed the rays to reach Earth's surface. The atmosphere is made of gases, such as helium, oxygen, and carbon dioxide. One of those gases is ozone. Ozone forms a layer high in the atmosphere--about 10 miles above Earth. The ozone layer blocks dangerous rays from the sun called ultraviolet (UV) rays. Exposure to UV rays can cause health problems, such as serious sunburns and skin cancer. During the recent alert in Punta Arenas, UV rays could have caused a serious sunburn in only 7 minutes. Scientists say that UV rays can also harm fish, small plants, and frogs' eggs. The map shows Earth's southernmost continent, Antartica. A hole in the ozone layer opens above Antartica each year. Scientists say a hole has formed in the ozone layer above the South Pole every July for at least 15 years. Each year, the hole grows, reaching its largest size in September and October. The hole then shrinks and finally disappears in November and December. This year, the hole was larger than ever. It covered an area of more than 11 million square miles. That's much larger than the combined areas of Antarctica and Australia! The hole in the ozone layer is mainly caused by chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), say scientists. CFCs are chemicals that have been used in home and car air conditioners, as well as in spray cans. CFCs rise high into Earth's atmosphere and destroy ozone there. In 1987, many countries agreed to limit the use of ozone-destroying chemicals. But CFCs stay in the atmosphere for decades. Even though CFCs are rarely used now, the chemical will cause problems for many years, scientists say.	4
Where does famous TV puppet Howdy Doody belong? That was the question that a court in Hartford, Connecticut, had to answer. The court recently decided that Howdy belongs to a museum in Detroit, Michigan. The puppet was featured on the Howdy Doody Show, the first children's TV show seen across the country. The show was aired between 1947 and 1960. It featured host Buffalo Bob and his sidekick puppet, Howdy Doody. When watching the show, kids saw Howdy on their TV screens, but they never saw the man who controlled the puppet--Rufus Rose. When the show ended, Rose kept Howdy. After Rose died, his children held on to Howdy. However, officials at the Detroit Institute of Arts said that Rose had promised to donate the puppet to the museum. Rose's family didn't want to give up the puppet, and the two sides asked a court to decide Howdy's fate. The court decided that Rose promised to donate Howdy to the museum. Soon, adults can be kids again when they visit with their old friend Howdy Doody.	4

"The words hurricane warning spark fear in the people who live along the East and West Coasts of the United States and the Gulf of Mexico. Each year, the deadly storms threaten communities, lives, and property. Hurricanes are pinwheel-shaped storms that start over a warm ocean and have winds of at least 73 miles per hour. The winds can be as fast as 150 miles per hour! Scientist Bill Gray tries to help people who live in areas where hurricanes hit. Each year, he predicts the number of hurricanes that will form in the Atlantic Ocean during hurricane season, which lasts from June 1 to November 30. This year, Gray predicts seven hurricanes will form in the Atlantic Ocean. Three of them, Gray predicts, may have wind speeds greater than 110 miles per hour. In 1999, eight hurricanes formed in the Atlantic Ocean. Although Gray predicts fewer hurricanes will form this year, it is still more hurricanes than usual. On average, six hurricanes form each year. Gray expects hurricanes to hit more often in years to come. ""There is a strong likelihood that in coming years, we'll see more major storms [than we have in the past],"" he said. He predicts more hurricanes because the Atlantic Ocean is warmer than usual. Hurricanes are killers. Last year, Hurricane Floyd killed 68 people and forced 3 million people to leave their homes. To help save lives, pilot Jim Carswell hunts hurricanes. Carswell flies an airplane into hurricanes to learn how strong the winds are. Carswell also helps predict the path each storm may take so that people who live in the storm's path can prepare for it. Each year, scientists name hurricanes to make communication about the storms clearer. Below are the names of the seven hurricanes Bill Gray predicts may form this year. As each hurricane forms, you can track it on a map in your classroom."	4
High up in a dense, lush bamboo forest in the Philippines, scientists hike up a steep and narrow trail. (The Philippines is an island country in South-east Asia.) As the scientists climb higher, they watch out for mud slides and rock falls. Finally, they emerge from under the forest's dripping leaves to face a forbidding black rock. As their eyes adjust to the light, they can see a small, narrow cave near the base of the rock. Inside that cave, and numerous other nearby caves, is a national treasure. The treasure is not made of gold and silver, however, but of flesh and bone. The treasure is actually dozens of mummies, some as old as 1,000 years. The Ibaloi people placed the mummies in the caves. The mummies are the remains of some of the Ibaloi leaders and their families. The descendants of the mummies still live in the Philippines. The mummies are located in an area called Kabayan in the Cordillera Central mountains. As many as 200 mummies may be located in 50 caves in the mountainous area. The mummies are important because they tell scientists about past life in the Philippines. The mummies are also sacred, which means they are important to the religion of the Ibaloi. Scientists from the National Museum of Manila in the Philippines are scrambling to find and protect all the mummies. The scientists worry that logging, forest fires, farming, or vandals may damage the mummies. To protect the mummies, the Philippine government is putting up gates in front of the caves. Guards and tour guides are being hired to show people the mummies and to keep vandals away. According to museum scientists, it took as much as one year to prepare an Ibaloi mummy. The process started when an Ibaloi tribal leader or family member who was near death drank a very salty liquid called brine. The brine helped preserve the body. The body was then strapped to a chair and placed over a low fire, as well as left in the sun to dry, for up to one year. Over time, the body would shrink. The body was then folded and placed in a coffin carved from a pine tree.	4
No, the 'iceman' isn't a villain from the Batman movies. At 5,300 years old, he's the world's oldest known mummy. Scientists recently thawed him out. The iceman, called Ötzi (OET-see), was found frozen in 1991 on a glacier in Italy. A glacier is a large body of ice that moves slowly. Ötzi is now stored in a museum in Italy in a room that is usually kept at 21 degrees Fahrenheit. Scientists recently increased the temperature in the room to thaw the iceman. They took samples of bone, blood, and teeth from Ötzi.	4
"Have you ever dreamed of throwing the winning touchdown pass at the Super Bowl or of driving the winning car at the Indianapolis 500? Brandon Conover, age 10, recently got to act out one of those dreams. The series The Jersey is about two teens, Nick Lighter and Morgan Hudson. The two inherit an old football jersey, which magically allows them to visit famous sports stars and sports events. How does Brandon feel about The Jersey? ""I like The Jersey because it's funny and cool when the kids get to turn into famous athletes,"" said Brandon."	4
"Kyung Yano first knew her son, Sho, was gifted when he was 3 years old. Yano was trying to play a difficult piece of music on the piano. After making many mistakes, she left the room in frustration, leaving little Sho playing under the piano. While she was standing at the kitchen sink, Yano heard the music she had been struggling with being played. When she went back, she saw Sho playing the piano. When Yano asked Sho what he was playing, he said, ""Mommy's music. I saw it. I know it."" Last fall, Sho enrolled at Loyola University in Chicago, Illinois, near his home. He's believed to be the youngest full-time college student in the United States. He hopes to graduate from college by age 12. What does Sho want to be when he grows up? ""I want to study genetics and find a cure for diseases such as AIDS,"" Sho said. Genetics is a science that studies living things, where they come from, and how they are different. Sho isn't the only kid in college. Twelve-year-old Jessica Meeker goes to Pennsylvania State University. Greg Smith was 10 when he started his first year at Randolph-Macon College in Virginia. Many people, however, wonder whether young kids should go to college. Some doctors say children in college miss out on having fun as kids. Dr. Stan Katz, a scientist in California, says it's important for kids to ""go through...child[hood]."" Katz said there are plenty of doctors and scientists who didn't go to college as kids but were successful anyway. Dr. Sharon Hirsh, a doctor at Children's Memorial Hospital in Chicago, says that college is good for superbright kids. She said. ""One of the things about smart kids is that they aren't challenged in regular schools."" Sho doesn't think he's missing any of his childhood by being in college. Besides, he says, at college he can study music, his other favorite subject. ""Someday,"" he said, ""I want to be a composer."""	4
"Leaping from his rowboat, Australian crocodile hunter Steve Irwin lands on top of a fierce 12-foot-long crocodile. Covered with mud, Irwin wrestles with the reptile and finally ties up its snout and legs. The out-of-breath hunter then stands in front of the croc and declares, ""She's a beauty!"" Irwin is the star of the hit TV show The Crocodile Hunter. In the United States, 60 million viewers see the wildlife show each week. The show is watched by people in 122 countries around the world. Irwin, age 38, has been interested in animals and the environment since he was a child. He grew up in a wildlife park in Queensland, a state in Australia. For his sixth birthday, Irwin's parents gave him a 12-foot snake called a scrub python. At age 9, Irwin captured his first crocodile. Ten years ago, Irwin took over the park that his parents had started. Five years ago, his show aired on American TV for the first time. The Crocodile Hunter is about more than wrestling crocodiles, snakes, and other wild animals, Irwin says. He explained that the show is also about making people aware of problems facing many animals. ""We don't run around capturing wildlife for the fun of it,"" Irwin said. ""Our love is to educate and share with the world threatened wildlife. We want to bring animals into your house so that we can share and learn about them."" For example, Irwin was recently on the Australian island of Tasmania. Irwin was working with the World Wildlife Fund to rescue stranded whales. He wants to call attention to whale hunting in the South Pacific Ocean. ""This practice [whaling] has to stop,"" Irwin said. Kent Vliet does not like ""the haphazard way in which [Irwin] handles snakes and gets bitten."" Vliet is a reptile expert who has worked for the National Geographic Society. Vliet fears that viewers might copy the croc hunter's dangerous moves and get hurt. For now, the croc hunter said he will keep on wrestling crocs and snakes and bringing people up close with some of Earth's endangered animals. ""I will continue to put my life on the line to save wildlife,"" he said. ""This is my passion, and it won't stop."""	4
"Scientists recently discovered three previously unknown species of mouse lemurs. The find is important, because the numbers of lemurs left in the wild is dwindling. Scientists found the lemurs on Madagascar, an island nation off the southeast coast of Africa. Madagascar is home to more than 30 species of lemurs. Most lemurs are the size of small rodents, but some can grow to be as large as a medium-sized dog. Lemurs are usually nocturnal animals, which means they mostly sleep during the day and come out at night. The discovery surprised scientists. ""It's incredibly rare to discover a new species of primate, let alone three new species,"" said Steven Goodman of the Field Museum of Natural History in Chicago. The newly discovered species live only in the rain forests along Madagascar's west coast. They weigh a few ounces and eat beetles, fruits, and plants. All lemurs on Madagascar are in trouble, however. Scientists fear that lemurs are in danger of becoming extinct. One threat is from people cutting down the trees in which lemurs live. The trees are being cleared to create farmland. Another threat to lemurs comes from hunters who are trapping the primates for food. To protect lemurs and the rain forests in which they live, wildlife officials in Madagascar have set up special parks and nature reserves. Loggers and hunters cannot cut down the trees or hunt the animals in the nature reserves. Scientists hope that the special areas are large enough to protect all the species of lemurs that are living today. Scientists are especially concerned because there may be undiscovered species that need protection. ""So many areas of Madagascar haven't been [explored],"" said Dean Gibson of the Duke University Primate Center. ""I think there are more [species] to find."""	4
"Gordon Zwicky knows how to tell a tall tale. He is a champion liar. Zwicky recently beat 299 contestants from the United States and Canada to win the Burlington Liar's Club contest. He said that he had won the lottery and decided to drive to Florida. A friend had warned him to read traffic signs carefully and he wouldn't have any problems. Shortly after setting out on the trip, Zwicky saw a sign that said, ""Clean Restrooms Ahead."" He arrived in Florida two months later--after cleaning 450 restrooms."	4
"In May and June, the weather is warm, days are getting longer, and many U.S. kids are looking forward to the end of the school year. Now, some schools are thinking about extending the school year--to July or even August! Most U.S. kids go to school for 180 days per year. But is that long enough? Many people don't think so. California's governor, Gray Davis, recently said he wants schools in his state to add 30 days to the school calendar. Across the country, other schools are adding on days and weeks. Some teachers say they have more to teach than ever before and could use the extra time. They teach more and harder subjects and provide additional information on topics such as safety and ethics. Moreover, many educators worry that summer vacation is a waste of time. Many parents work away from the home, and many kids spend summers home alone or at camps that do not stress education. ""What you have is three months of time in which kids forget what they've learned and get into trouble,"" said Delaine Eastin, an educator in California. Not everyone agrees that kids need to spend more time in school. Some say that schools need to make better use of the time they already have. ""Quality is the key to making time matter,"" said education expert Julie Aronson, who is the author of a report called Improving Student Achievement by Extending School: Is It Just a Matter of Time? ""Only when time is used more effectively will adding more of it result in improved learning for students,"" said Aronson. Many educators agree with Aronson. They worry that students are not spending enough time learning in school."	4
During the summer, a strange brown goo fell from the sky onto buildings and people in several towns in Idaho. The sticky goo coated everything it fell on. People splattered by the weird substance couldn't figure out what it was. Now, the state's Department of Environmental Quality has identified it. The strange substance is not some weird goo from space. It is actually bee waste. The environmental workers found an unusually large number of beehives near the towns where the goo fell. When the bees from those hives flew over the communities, they dropped the waste. Because it was a good year for bees, there was a lot of waste. Luckily, the bee goo is made mostly of pollen and is harmless.	4
"Weekly Reader recently told you about some problems manatees face. A poll found that most Florida voters want more done to protect manatees. The poll found that at least 65 percent of Florida's voters favor new steps that would help protect the endangered manatees. Some of those steps include lowering the speed limit for boats in manatee zones, increasing fines for people who speed in manatee zones, limiting the amount of building along waterways where manatees are found, and creating additional protected areas for manatees. ""We are struck by [how far] Florida voters are willing to go to protect manatees,"" said Kate Stewart, who conducted the poll. She said the results also showed that ""boaters and non-boaters alike not just support but strongly support increased protection measures."" Florida manatees live in the state's warm coastal and inland waters. The Save the Manatee Club says that the Florida manatee population has been shrinking since 1974, when scientists started keeping track. Collisions with boats cause many manatee deaths. Since manatees swim slowly, they cannot get out of the way of a fast-moving boat. According to the Save the Manatee Club, 78 manatees were killed in collisions with boats in Florida waters last year. So far this year, at least 23 manatees have been killed in collisions."	4
"Right now, 53 million kids--more kids than ever before--are in school in the United States. So many kids are now attending school that many communities don't have enough schools for all of them. To solve that problem, some communities are sending kids to school in old stores, car dealerships, and malls! The number of kids in school is increasing. In 15 years, eight million more kids than today will attend U.S. schools. Educators wonder what to do with all those kids. ""We need to figure out where we will put these children and who will teach them,"" said Richard Riley, U.S. Secretary of Education. Mesa, Arizona, is typical of many communities that have more kids than school space. Mesa has 84 schools and 550 classroom trailers parked around those schools. And still there isn't enough room for all the school-age kids. To solve its space problem, officials in Mesa are building new schools. The community is also recycling old stores into schools. This year, 700 elementary students in Mesa are attending the new Pedro Guerrero School, which used to be a supermarket. Where families once shopped for vegetables, kids now learn reading, history, science, and math. Cassandra Fernandez attends the new school. The fifth grader's mother, who used to shop at the store, was worried when she heard that the city planned to turn it into a school. ""I thought, how are they going to make that [store] into a school?"" she said. Cassandra's mother, however, now likes the school and all the new equipment in it. Mesa isn't the only community that has recycled old buildings into schools. Schools in Georgia, New Jersey, Ohio, and other states are also recycling schools. Recycling old buildings into schools is less expensive and takes less time than building new schools. Recycling schools also helps the environment by leaving space for trees."	4
"In wartime, U.S. Navy ships face many dangers. As the ships cruise at top speeds through the ocean, one of the deadliest threats is from underwater bombs called mines. Ships use special sensors to locate mines. Some of those waterways have canal locks. A lock is an area of water in a canal enclosed by a set of gates at each end. The gates open to allow a ship to enter. The lock then fills with water to raise the ship or drains water to lower it. A lock allows a ship to move from one elevation to another. Canal locks, however, can be deadly traps for manatees. An average of ten manatees a year have been killed in the gates in the past decade. The sensors work using sound waves, said Larry Taylor, the engineer overseeing the project. ""When the canal lock sensors [detect] a manatee, they stop the doors from closing,"" said Taylor. Within a few weeks after the Port Canaveral installation, the sensors had saved seven manatees, Taylor said. He said there are plans to install the sensors at seven more Florida canal locks. ""This is a great system that will really help the manatees,"" Taylor recently told Weekly Reader."	4
"Do you keep your elbows off the dinner table while you eat? Do you always remember to say ""please"" and ""you are welcome""? Do you shake hands with people you meet? If not, then you might need a class in etiquette. Etiquette classes teach kids how to be polite and how to act around other people. Today, more and more parents across the United States are sending their kids to etiquette classes. ""The attendance has skyrocketed,"" said Lynda Ely, who teaches etiquette to more than 200 kids in Maryland. ""The enrollment this year has doubled from last year."" At first, many kids say they don't like etiquette classes. ""I thought it was stupid,"" said one Maryland student during his first etiquette class. Another student simply said, ""I wanna go home!"" However, etiquette expert Michele Pollard Patrick says etiquette lessons can help all kids, especially when they grow up. ""When you're little and cute,"" she said, ""it's OK if you don't have manners, but at some point [in life] you need to have them."" The origins of the word etiquette can be traced to France hundreds of years ago. France is a country in Europe. The king of France, Louis XIV, was building a new palace called Versailles (vehr-SIGH). Gardeners tried to plant lawns and gardens around the palace, but people kept walking on them, mashing the grass and flowers. To keep people off the grass, the gardeners put up signs. Those signs were called etiquettes. Over time, the word came to mean the correct way of doing things, not just walking around the grounds surrounding the royal palace at Versailles. Carol Jackson takes her daughters, Emily, age 11, and Katie, age 8, to etiquette classes. She said lessons on shaking hands and making eye contact are important. ""It's stuff that will help [kids] later in life,"" Jackson said. '""It's Stuff That You Sort of Know, But Don't Really Do."" (Michael Pho, age 14) In his etiquette classes, David has learned how to shake hands and eat properly. He has also learned to always leave the last cookie for someone else. ""These are just good things for him to learn,"" said David's mother."	4
"President George W. Bush and Laura Bush have settled into the White House. Even though their daughters, Barbara and Jenna, are at college, the President and First Lady are not alone. They have three pets with them. Spot Fetcher Bush, one of the dogs, should feel right at home in the White House. She was born there in 1989. Spot's mother was Millie. Millie belonged to Bush's parents, former President George Bush and his wife, Barbara. The Bushes' other dog, Barney, also has political connections. Christine Todd Whitman, the head of the Environmental Protection Agency, gave Barney to the Bush family. India, a cat, is the only White House pet that does not have political connections. It is nicknamed ""Willie."""	4
"Investing and stock market. If you think those words are spoken only by adults who wear suits and work on Wall Street, think again. Some of today's investors wear baggy pants and T-shirts and ride skateboards. In other words, they're kids! About 5 million U.S. kids ages 12 to 17 don't just stash their money in piggy banks or savings accounts. They invest in the stock market. A stock market is a place to buy and sell shares of stock in all kinds of companies. Owning a share of stock means you own a small piece of a company. The more shares you own, the more of a company you own. People who invest, or use their money to buy stocks, in the stock market are called investors. If a company makes money, it may pay investors dividends, or some of the company's profits. Another way investors make money is by selling their shares of stock at a price higher than the price they paid when they bought shares of the company's stock. Making money in the stock market may seem easy, but it's risky. Investors can lose money when a stock's price drops. That's why financial experts say kids should learn about a company before investing in it. One expert suggests that kids start by investing in companies that make products they use. Eric Olson, age 17, has been investing since he was 13 years old. He says kids should ""read everything on investing--books, magazine articles, the business pages of [the] newspaper."" As kids read, investing will be easier to understand, Eric said."	4
"What might the robot of the future be like? Will it look like a human? Will it be a giant that can haul heavy equipment? According to scientists Doug Adkins and Ed Heller, the robot of the future will be tiny. Adkins and Heller have built a new robot that is so small, it can sit on a dime. The tiny robot weighs less than 1 ounce, has tracks like those on a tank, and carries a camera. For power, it uses three button cells (the batteries in watches). So far, the robot cannot do many tasks. Recently, the robot steered itself through a small maze, but it moved at only 20 inches per minute. ""It can't zip along as fast as a spider or ant yet,"" said Heller. In the near future, however, Heller plans to make faster and smaller robots. He foresees swarms of miniature robots doing all kinds of tasks. Police officers could send the small robots after crooks, and the bad guys would never know they were being tailed. Repair workers could send worker robots into tight spaces."	4
On March 23, the 135-ton Mir space station plunged to Earth in a controlled fall. As Mir fell, it broke into some 1,500 pieces that splashed into the Pacific Ocean. The former Soviet Union launched Mir into Earth orbit in 1986. Over the years, astronauts from many countries traveled to Mir to study space and the impact space has on the human body. In recent years, the aging space station was plagued by serious problems. Mir survived an onboard fire, several life-threatening oxygen leaks, and a collision with a Russian cargo spaceship. The station also had computer failures and power outages. In the end, the Russians could not raise enough money to repair and modernize Mir. Because of those and other problems, the Russian government feared that Mir would crash to Earth accidentally. So Russia decided to bring Mir down in a controlled descent. The Russians chose to drop Mir into a remote area of the Pacific near Australia. They wanted to make sure that no one would be hurt by the fiery fragments of the space station, which burned as it streaked through Earth's atmosphere. While the Russians assured the world that no one would be harmed by the falling debris, Taco Bell placed a target in the Pacific Ocean. The fast-food chain promised to give everyone in the United States a free taco if Mir smashed into the target. The falling station missed the target.	4
"Some of the World's most important monuments and parks are being loved to death. Many sites around the world are in bad shape because of a recent sharp increase in the number of tourists worldwide. The causes of damage range from everyday wear and tear to pollution to vandalism, or the destruction of property on purpose. Each year, hundreds of millions of tourists visit special places around the world. In fact, according to the World Tourism Organization, by the end of this year about 668 million people will have made tourist trips. By 2020, the organization said, that number may more than double, to 1.5 billion tourists! The problem is that a large number of visitors can damage a monument or park. The thousands of cars and buses that carry tourists to a site create air pollution. Air pollution can discolor and damage monuments made of stone and other materials. Huge numbers of tourists also cause garbage to pile up. And sometimes tourists take pieces of monuments away with them as souvenirs. Yellowstone and Grand Canyon National Parks. These are two of the biggest national parks in the United States. Millions of tourists each year crowd into these areas. As a result, air pollution, garbage, and other damage have marred these awesome sites. The Parthenon. The Parthenon is a temple that was built almost 2,500 years ago in Athens, a city in the European country of Greece. Air pollution has pitted and discolored the marble that the beautiful building is made of. U.S. Parks and Monuments To help preserve such important places, new rules are being written by organizations such as UNESCO, which is a part of the United Nations. UNESCO is working with governments worldwide to limit the number of tourists who visit some special sites. UNESCO is also working to educate sightseers about how to avoid damaging the places they visit. As one student who works with UNESCO said, ""You have to protect the past to reach tomorrow."""	4
From our planet, you can see Earth's single moon in the evening sky. Imagine living on a planet that has 17 moons! That's the number of moons that orbit Jupiter, the largest planet in our solar system. Scientists spotted a 17th moon orbiting Jupiter while they were looking for comets. Scientists say the newly discovered moon is 3 miles wide. It is the smallest of Jupiter's known moons. Scientists used to think that Leda, a moon discovered in 1974, was Jupiter's smallest moon. Leda is between 5 and 10 miles wide. Scientists have not officially named the newly discovered moon yet. For now they are calling it S/1999 J1.	4
"About 140 years ago, the Pony Express delivered mail to some parts of the United States. Today, mail is delivered to most communities by cars, trucks, trains, and planes. But in Supai, Arizona, mail carriers still deliver the mail the way carriers did 100 years ago--by mules. About 600 Native Americans live in Supai. The town is located at the bottom of a canyon near the Grand Canyon. Letter carrier Charlie Chamberlain loads packages on mules. The mules deliver mail to Supai, Arizona. Before being delivered in Supai, mail arrives in the post office in Peach Springs, Arizona, about 70 miles from Supai. From Peach Springs, delivery trucks take the mail to the rim of the canyon. Letter carriers then use mules to carry the mail to Supai. ""It's amazing what people can do when they put their minds to it,"" said Charlie Chamberlain, a letter carrier. ""They can pack things that you never would have thought of."" A washing machine is the most unusual item Charlie has delivered."	4
"For many years, parents in Honduras have been giving their children unusual first names. Some parents in the Central American country have given their children such names as Bujia, which means ""Spark Plug,"" or Llanta de Milagro, which means ""Miracle Tire."" Other parents have named their children after famous American presidents. For example, one kid's first name is Bill Clinton, and another kid's name is Ronald Reagan. Now, a government committee in Honduras wants parents to stop giving their children such unusual names. The committee worries that some kids could tease those kids with uncommon names. ""Without a doubt,"" the committee said, ""such names are a bother to the people who have to carry them through life."""	4
"Daytona Beach, Florida--As millions of racing fans watched the closing lap of the Daytona 500 car race last month, they saw a familiar sight. Dale Earnhardt, nicknamed ""the Intimidator,"" was near the front of the pack. In an instant, however, Earnhardt's car swerved and slammed into the track's concrete wall. That crash instantly killed the legendary driver, who was considered the Michael Jordan of NASCAR racing. (NASCAR stands for National Association for Stock Car Auto Racing.) When Earnhardt's car, painted with the driver's well-known number 3, slammed into the wall, he was traveling at 180 miles per hour. According to doctors who examined Earnhardt, the racing legend died of a head injury caused by the crash. Many safety experts say that if Earnhardt had been wearing a HANS device, he might have survived the crash. HANS stands for head and neck support. The device is a rigid collar that slips over a driver's uniform and rests on his or her shoulders. Two straps connect the helmet to the collar, locking the helmet in place. The device is designed to prevent a driver's head from whipping forward or side to side in an accident. NASCAR driver Robby Gordon ordered a HANS device immediately after the race in which Earnhardt was killed. ""As a direct result of what happened at the [Daytona] 500, I have ordered the support system,"" said Gordon. NASCAR officials say they will look more closely at the device and may require drivers to wear it in the future. Until then, drivers, who are well aware of the risks in their sport, will continue to get behind the wheel."	4
"The 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney, Australia, will be a place of many firsts. The Games, which start on September 15, are the first Olympic Games to take place in the 21st century. And, for the first time in Olympic history, people will hear such words as seat drop and cha-gi. People will hear those words because the sports in which those terms are used--trampoline and tae kwon do (TIGH KWAHN DOH)--are being played for the first time officially at a Summer Olympics. Another sport, triathlon, is also making its first Olympic appearance this year. The triathlon is a race that includes swimming, bicycling, and running. Although new to the Olympics, tae kwon do, trampoline, and triathlon are not new sports. In fact, tae kwon do, which is similar to karate, has been around for more than 1,000 years. (In Korean, tae means ""kick,"" kwon means ""punch,"" and do means ""art"" or ""way."") The athletes who compete in the newly admitted Olympic sports are very excited about going to Sydney. ""It is an awesome feeling, and I don't even know how to explain it."" said Barbara Kunkel. Kunkel is a member of the U.S. tae kwon do team. A sport must meet certain rules to become a part of the Olympic Games. Leaders of a sport must apply to be a part of the Olympics seven years before the sport can be included in any Olympic Games. The United States is sending more than 200 athletes to the Games in Sydney. Those athletes are competing against athletes from more than 190 nations. The last Summer Olympics took place in the United States in 1996. The 1996 Games were held in Atlanta, Georgia, and the United States won 101 medals, the most won in the 1996 Games. This year, U.S. athletes, including Barbara Kunkel, are trying for a Olympic repeat."	4
"Singer and actress Janet Jackson stars in Nutty Professor II: The Klumps, which opened in theaters last summer. Jackson plays Denise Gaines, the new wife of chubby Sherman Klumps, played by Eddie Murphy. ""I really wanted this part,"" said Jackson, who auditioned three times for the role. Jackson said she liked the first Nutty Professor movie, which opened in theaters in 1996. She said she could not ""pass up the opportunity to work with Eddie [Murphy],"" who has starred in many movies, including Dr. Dolittle. Janet not only draws on her acting skills but her singing skills as well. She sings a song called ""Doesn't Really Matter."""	4
The Internet is not the only place where you should be careful with strangers. Here are some tips to keep in mind when you're on a street: If you are home alone after school, don't open the door for anyone unless you know and trust the person. If someone calls, don't tell him or her you are home alone.	4
"In late November, an oil tanker carrying crude oil spilled half a million gallons of oil into the Mississippi River in Louisiana. Sticky oil flowed from the ship into the river, which is often called the ""Big Muddy."" The oil spill closed the river for 26 miles. About 567,000 gallons of oil gushed from six gashes in the tanker. The gashes were cut into the tanker Westchester after its engine exploded, causing the ship to run aground, about 60 miles south of New Orleans, Louisiana. The oil flowed out until the tanker hit the bottom of the river. The river bottom apparently plugged the leaks, explained Virginia Miller, a spokesperson for the ship's operator. The oil spill is the largest in United States waters since 1989. In that year, the Exxon Valdez ran aground, spilling more than 11 million gallons of oil into Prince William Sound, Alaska. Emergency crews scrambled to clean up the Westchester spill. More than 100 workers and 30 ships tried to keep the oil from spreading. At first, workers feared that the oil spill would harm wildlife that live in the river. But wind blew most of the oil away from those areas. ""We dodged the bullet,"" said Jimmy Jenkins, a wildlife official in Louisiana. ""We're not looking at a whole lot of damage."""	4
Car tires have been rolling through the news. The news is that experts believe Firestone tires have a defect, or problem, that is causing the tires to burst. Bursting tires may have caused many car accidents. As a result of the possible defect, 6.5 million Firestone tires are being taken off cars and thrown away. But what happens to old tires? Each year, Americans throw away 276 million tires. About 70 percent of those tires are recycled, or made into other things. Many of those tires are shredded and pressed together to make surfaces for playgrounds. Kids could be playing on surfaces made from tires that your family threw away. Even though most tires are recycled, many are piled up in huge mounds because the tires can't be recycled fast enough. Some experts say between 2 billion and 3 billion tires in the United States are waiting to be recycled.	4
"""SHIP'S LOG: 6 A.M., July 12, 2000. The Amistad sets sail from Mystic Seaport in Mystic, Connecticut. Aboard the Amistad are the ship's captain, nine crew members, several TV reporters, visiting officials, and three Weekly Reader editors. During the summer, millions of people gathered at port cities along the East Coast to watch OpSail2000, or Operation Sail. Many of the ships that took part in OpSail2000 were tall ships, sailing vessels that have two or more masts, the tall upright poles to which sails are attached. The Amistad was one of the ships that sailed in OpSail2000. It is a replica, or copy, of La Amistad, a ship that sailed about 150 years ago. In 1839, La Amistad was in Havana, Cuba. There, the ship's captain bought 53 people who had been kidnapped from Africa and taken as slaves to Cuba. The captain of La Amistad planned to sail to another port in Cuba to sell the slaves. But three days after leaving Havana, the Africans rebelled and took control of the ship. They didn't know how to steer the ship, and La Amistad ended up sailing north to the United States. Two months later, a U.S. ship spotted La Amistad and took it to New London. The Africans were arrested and put on trial for piracy. The court had to decide whether the Africans were pirates and whether they were slaves or free people. On March 9, 1841, the court decided that the Africans were not slaves. Most of them returned to Africa. The modern Amistad is a floating classroom that teaches people about history. Bill Pinkney, the captain of the Amistad, said the story of La Amistad has much to teach people. ""It is a story about freedom. It is a story about right and wrong."" Thousands of visitors have seen the Amistad. One visitor, Shanelle Bird, age 10, said, ""I learned that sometimes people have to fight for their rights, for their freedom."""	4
"A group of students discovered more than 85 ancient canoes last April in a dry lake bed in Florida. Scientists later dug up the canoes to study them. They recently reported that the canoes were built between 3,000 and 5,000 years ago. The students found the canoes in a lake near Gainesville, Florida. The Seminole people used to live near the lake. Seminole Chief James Billie said his ancestors called the lake Pithlachocco, which means ""place of the long boats."" The sunken wooden canoes were exposed when the lake's water level dropped last spring. The mud at the bottom of the lake had preserved the canoes. The scientists who studied the canoes say they are 22 feet long. After studying the canoes, the scientists returned them to the lake bed. They explained that leaving the ancient canoes exposed to the air would have caused them to crumble in a few days or weeks."	4
"Doctors say that kids are carrying too much weight in their backpacks. The heavy packs are causing kids to suffer from back problems. According to many doctors, kids should carry no more than 10 to 15 percent of their body weight in a backpack. A 60-pound student should carry a pack that weighs no more than 9 pounds, for example. ""Some of the students weigh only 60 pounds,"" said middle school principal Dave Myers. ""So with the backpacks on, they're like turtles. If they fell over, they wouldn't be able to get up."""	4
"Swoosh! Thump! Demarest plunged into a deep, tangled snake hole up to his armpits. Hearing snakes slithering around him, Demarest froze. For half an hour, the scientist didn't move, waiting for the snakes to settle down so he could climb out safely. While stuck in that snaky situation, Demarest looked around and realized the pit was actually part of a jungle-covered three-story building. As soon as he got out of the hole, Demarest and his team of scientists explored the hill. They found that it was an ancient palace built by the Maya people. The Mayan civilization covered parts of Mexico and Central America, and reached its greatest power between the years 250 and 900. Demarest's team also discovered a city surrounding the palace. The Maya people called the city Cancuén, which means ""place of serpents."" The palace at Cancuén was built more than 1,300 years ago by the Mayan king Tah ak Chaan. So far, Demarest and his team have counted 170 rooms in the palace, which has 11 courtyards and covers an area the size of two football fields. Because of its sturdy limestone walls, the palace is in extremely good condition, Demarest said. Demarest said Cancuén is different from other Mayan cities. Unlike the other Mayan cities, Cancuén doesn't have temples or evidence that there was warfare. ""The basis of power among the Mayan [kings] was religion and warfare,"" explained Demarest. ""Apparently, Cancuén needed neither."" Demarest said the city must have been very powerful. But its leaders were more focused on commerce, or widespread buying and selling, than on religion or warfare. Located near the Pasión River, Cancuén was a thriving trading center for the Maya. ""That river,"" Demarest said, ""was really the superhighway of the Mayan world."" Jade, a semiprecious stone, is everywhere at the site, Demarest said. Scientists even uncovered the remains of a woman who had jade false teeth! Finely carved jade statues were found in the graves of workmen. Demarest estimates that it will take about 10 to 15 years to excavate, or dig out, Cancuén. In his 20 years of uncovering Mayan ruins, he said, Cancuén is ""by far the most spectacular."" The snakes must think so, too. ""A buried palace is exciting to us,"" said Demarest, ""but it's even more exciting to snakes. They love it! This place is full of snakes."""	4
"On December 6, two airplane passengers attracted a lot of attention at an airport in Washington, D.C. Each of the passengers had fluffy black-and-white fur and weighed more than 100 pounds. The passengers were two giant pandas--Mei Xiang and Tian Tian. Mei Xiang (MAY SHONG) is a 2-year-old female panda. Her name means ""beautiful fragrance."" Tian Tian (tee-YEN tee-YEN) is a 3-year-old male panda. His name means ""more and more."" The map shows China, the most populated country in the world. More than 1.2 billion people live within China's 3.7 million square miles. The two pandas arrived from China aboard a plane called Panda One. From the airport, Mei Xiang and Tian Tian were taken to the National Zoo, where they will live for the next ten years. Officials at the National Zoo agreed to give China $10 million in exchange for lending the United States the two pandas. That money will be used to protect pandas from becoming extinct in central China. About 1,000 pandas live in the mountain forests of central China, where they eat mainly bamboo shoots. The pandas need the forests to survive. The land where pandas are found, however, is being cleared and used for farmland. The trees are being used for firewood to heat people's homes. There are now seven pandas living in the United States. Two are in Washington, D.C.; two are in Atlanta, Georgia; and three are in San Diego, California. One of those seven pandas is a baby. The baby panda, Hua Mei, was born at the San Diego Zoo on August 21, 1999. Hua Mei is the first baby panda born in the Western Hemisphere since 1990. When he was born, he weighed less than 5 ounces and looked more like a rat than a panda. Fa Mingzhi is one of more than 4 million people who live near the area where the pandas Mei Xiang and Tian Tian come from. Most of the people who live in that area are farmers who need the forest to survive. Like many people, Fa Mingzhi wants to protect the animals. But, she says, people want to eat, too. ""It's good to protect the panda, but it's harder now on the people who live here,"" she said."	4
What's purple and gold, wears sneakers, has horns and a tail, and weighs several hundred pounds? A statue of a cow, of course! People in several U.S. cities are being treated to herds of cow sculptures. The sculptures are part of Cows on Parade. Cows on Parade started in Switzerland in 1998. A U.S. businessman saw the cows and brought the idea to the United States in 1999. This year, about 1,000 cows are on display in several U.S. cities. Each cow is made of fiberglass and was decorated by a local artist, including some kids. The cows will be left on display until October.	4
"Ann Thompson is one of the best athletes in the world. She is the captain of the U.S. Paralympic women's basketball team. She has already won five medals in earlier Paralympic games, and she is determined to win another in Sydney, Australia. Recently, Weekly Reader spoke with Ann at her home. Ann Thompson: The Paralympics began in 1960. They parallel the Olympic Games. That's where the name comes from. AT: Eighteen sports are included the Paralympics. This year, we have two new sports, wheelchair rugby and sailing. AT: Besides the health benefits, sports teach many skills. First, there's the mental discipline involved with sports. You always have to concentrate, think, and plan ahead. Also, sports teach teamwork, leaderships skills, and self-confidence. WR: Sports have always been a part of your life. What happened when you were 16 years old that almost ended your sports career? AT: When I was younger, I was a skier. I was training in Austria when I fell and severed my spinal cord. AT: It didn't change anything. I never missed a beat. The accident didn't change my goals. My mind was not touched in the accident. I could do everything after the accident that I could do before it, except walk. AT: Well, one thing changed. I switched sports. I'm no longer a skier. In the 1988, 1992, and 1996 Paralympics, I competed in track and field events, winning four medals. This year, I'm on the basketball team. AT: Try. And I mean really try. If you want to do something, give it your best effort. If you find a roadblock in your path, take a detour. If you really want to do something, you can find a way to do it. Rudy Garcia-Tolson is an athlete, even though he doesn't have legs. Rudy bikes, runs, skateboards, and swims. How does he do all that? ""Nothing stops me,"" the 11-year-old said. Rudy was born with many illnesses, including legs that didn't work. His doctors replaced Rudy's flesh and blood legs with metal ones. Last year, Rudy took part in 25 races, 20 swim meets, and a few triathalons a combination of running, swimming, and biking. He is now preparing for the Paralympics in 2004."	4
"Chaille (pronounced SHAL-ee) Stovall is a movie director. He is now working on his fifth film. But you may not have heard of him because he's only 11 years old! Chaille's latest movie, Party Animals, is about the 2000 presidential election. The movie, Chaille told Weekly Reader, ""asks why a kid should care about politics."" To answer that question, Chaille interviewed the candidates. He met with Texas Governor George W. Bush at the governor's mansion. And he traveled with Vice President Al Gore on his campaign bus."	4
"When penguins in the southern Atlantic Ocean look up to see a plane or helicopter, they fall over. Pilots call the backward flop ""the penguin plunge."" ""It was amazing,"" said one pilot. ""[The penguins would] all lean back farther and farther as they craned their necks to get a look at the helicopters. Then they'd fall on the ground like a pack of cards."" Scientists are going to an island near Antarctica to study the problem. The island is home to 400,000 king penguins. King penguins weigh an average 77 pounds and are about 3 feet tall. The scientists fear the penguin plunge may be causing the penguins to leave their eggs unprotected. As a result, fewer eggs may hatch."	4
"A saber-toothed cat leaps from behind a bush. It moves toward the side of a stream. It's a hot day, and the cat is thirsty. What the cat doesn't see is the shallow pool of liquid asphalt that is covered by a thin layer of sand. As the cat nears the stream, it steps into the sticky black asphalt. Soon, all four paws are stuck in the muck, and the cat is trapped. Struggling to get free, the cat becomes covered in the asphalt. Several days pass, and the cat, still stuck in the asphalt, dies of starvation. Now, 35,000 years later, that sandy streamside spot is known as the La Brea (BRAY-ah) tar pits in Los Angeles, California. Last month, scientists finished their annual dig at La Brea's Pit 91. The scientists unearthed nearly 1,000 fossils and spent time studying those fossils. ""The information we captured will tell us more about what life was like in this area 35,000 years ago than we've ever known before,"" said scientist Chris Shaw. By studying the fossils pulled from the tar pits, scientists are learning more about how Earth's environment has changed through time. Shaw has been working at the La Brea site for nearly 30 years. ""My favorite part of the job is when I'm actually in the pit digging,"" Shaw told Weekly Reader. He added that he has become used to being covered in dirt and asphalt. ""It's like working in a big sandbox."" Shaw spends much of his time at the George C. Page Museum in Los Angeles overseeing the huge collection of fossils pulled from La Brea. The museum holds thousands of fossils of prehistoric animals that died in the tar pit. Some of the animals that fell into La Brea include woolly mammoths, bison, horses, ground sloths, western camels, and llamas. Many of the fossils that have been collected are from about 25,000 to 35,000 years ago. Digging at Pit 91 has stopped until May 2001. In the meantime, Shaw and other scientists will study the many fossils they have pulled from La Brea. After 30 years, Shaw still loves his work. ""The coolest thing about doing fieldwork,"" Shaw said, ""is realizing that the fossil you're touching has not seen the light of day for about 30,000 years."""	4
"On March 16, Michael Yachinich of Chicago Heights, Illinois, heard a smoke alarm go off on the stairs to his upstairs bedroom. Michael, age 7, quickly went into the living room where his mother was sleeping. He woke her up, and the two quickly left the house. They ran to a neighbor's house and called 911. The fire was quickly contained by firefighters. Michael had recently participated in his school's ""Great Escape"" project for Fire Prevention Week. Michael and his family knew how to exit their home safely during a fire. Firefighter Terrence Campbell of the Glenwood Fire Department said that Michael showed good fire safety behavior. He acted quickly to help his mom leave the house and report the fire, as well as by using a home escape plan to escape danger. ""I feel that his actions from the 1999 ""Great Escape"" project helped Michael know what to do,"" Campbell said. An escape plan also helped save the lives of the Walker family in Ontario, Canada. Shortly after 3 a.m. on February 18, 1999, a fire began in the ground floor apartment below the Walker apartment. The family awoke to find their apartment filling with smoke. Everyone reacted immediately. The family put their home fire escape plan into action, and everyone left the building right away and went to their meeting place outside. By the time they got there, flames were racing through the apartment. Earlier in the school year, 9-year-old twins Ashley and Ryan Walker participated in their school's ""Great Escape"" fire safety program. Mr. Walker says the twins helped the family know what to do when the fire began. ""They pushed the fire procedures,"" he said. ""They learned them at school and had us practice how to get out."" Although the idea of a fire starting in your home is scary, you can use the prevention skills taught in your school to keep fires from starting in your home. But, if a fire does start, you can prepare your family and yourself by having a ""Great Escape"" plan and practicing it at least twice a year!"	4
"Last month in New Jersey, two soccer teams were locked in a tied game. The game finally ended in a dramatic finish. The game did not end with a tie-breaking shoot-out, however. It ended because of a fight between parents and coaches. The fight started because one coach wanted the other coach to move from behind the goal during a shoot-out kick. Soon the coaches were yelling at each other. Then parents ran onto the field, and some of the adults threw punches. No one was hurt and no kids were involved in the fight. But many towns across the United States are wondering what can be done to stop these kinds of ugly scenes from happening. Many of the fights at kids' sporting events start because of decisions made by referees. ""There are going to be bad calls, and refs have been called names. But that's part of the game,"" Barry Mano told Weekly Reader. Mano is the president of the National Association of Sports Officials. In kids' sporting events today, bad calls can result in a lot worse than name-calling, Mano said. ""We are seeing between 50 and 100 attacks a year on referees."" Mano recently told Weekly Reader that fighting at kids' sporting events is a national problem. ""We need to have long-term education"" to teach people how to behave at sporting events and solve the problem, Mano said. Mano said that parents must keep in mind that they are important role models for kids. He also said the quality of referees at kids' sporting events needs to be improved. ""Sports are a great place for kids to learn. We just have to make sure that kids can have fun while playing,"" said Fred Engh. Engh is president of the National Alliance for Youth Sports. The group promotes good sporting behavior among kids, parents, and coaches involved with youth sports. Engh told Weekly Reader that there is one important thing kids can do to help prevent bad scenes at sporting events. ""Kids can remind their parents that this is just a game and that it's a time to have fun,"" Engh said."	4
"HI! MY NAME IS PAM POLLSTER. This is my pet parakeet, Polly. We live in Polling Place. Polly is a smart bird. In fact, she's so smart, she can count very high numbers. This is good, because I need Polly's help--and yours--with a problem. The problem is that Polling Place needs a new motto. The one we have now is kind of lame. Want to hear it? ""Polling Place. Live Here. It's Nice."" I told you it was lame. That's why we need a new motto. The town council came up with three choices. Now, it's up to Polly and me to find out which choice people like best. How are Polly and I going to find out everyone's opinion? It won't be easy. A few thousand people live in Polling Place. We sure don't have the time to go to every person's house to find out which motto he or she likes. (Besides, my bike has a flat tire and my in-line skates don't fit.) So what should we do? Well, Polly came up with a great idea. We can poll the people of Polling Place! (Told you she was smart.) A poll is a way of asking a small part of a large group of people what they think. Then, using math, you can figure out what the larger group is thinking. Polls are used all the time. In fact, they are really important during elections. (You know, the big thing that's on the news all the time?) Polls are also used to help the government, businesses, and organizations make decisions or plans. So, what is the first step for our motto poll of Polling Place? Turn the page to find out! Believe it or not, polling has been around for a long time in the United States. One of the first political polls was done in 1824! In those days, newspapers asked readers to write in saying the person they liked for president. One newspaper did a poll that said Andrew Jackson would be president. But Jackson didn't get enough votes to win. John Quincy Adams won that election and became our seventh president. Why was the newspaper wrong? The biggest problem was that only the readers of that one newspaper took part in the poll. It did not show what all people in the U.S. felt. By the 1960s, polling became more scientific. Such a scientific poll was used by John F. Kennedy during the 1960 presidential election. The poll, done by Louis Harris, figured out what issues people were worried about. For a poll to be scientific, three things must happen. Get a sample. The people who run a poll need to get a sample of people. A sample is a small part of a larger group of people. A sample for a poll must include ALL types of people, like boys and girls, young and old. Also, no one can know who is going to get picked for a poll's sample. And no one can volunteer to take part in a poll. Figure it out. Finally, experts, sometimes with the help of math, study the data, or people's answers. Then they put the data into charts so that it is easier for everyone to understand. So how did Polly and I poll the people of Polling Place? Here's how we did it. Step 1. The first step was to figure out the subject of the poll. That was easy! We wrote down the following on a piece of paper: Step 2. The tough part of polling is figuring out how to ask people our questions and get their answers. One way is to send people out to ask our questions. Another is to call people on the telephone. The Internet is also another way of polling. Polly and I decided to go out and ask a sample of all kinds of people. Step 3. We now have our data from the people of Polling Place! Next we will put it together into a chart. So what's the result? Which motto did the people of Polling Place like best?"	4
Governor Bush says he wants to help people who live in poverty by lowering or eliminating their taxes. Bush would allow the 6 million poorest families in the United States to pay no taxes. He also says that the best way out of poverty is education. He wants to improve all schools--especially schools in poor communities. Vice President Gore wants to lower taxes for the neediest families. He wants to help end poverty by improving schools. Gore says he wants to hold all schools accountable for improving education. Gore also wants to help senior citizens pay for prescription medications. Right now, he says, many seniors can't afford the medicines they need.	4
"The trio of tots is very popular. ""They're special,"" said Laura Fodora, age 12. ""Superheroes are [usually] for boys, and this is for girls."" But believe it or not, more boys than girls actually watch the show. Today is Friday the 13th. The fear of the number 13 is known as triskaidekaphobia. The fear of big words is... hippopotomonstroses-quippedaliophobia! Powerpuff mania has also hit stores. Kids are buying all kinds of merchandise related to the TV show. You've probably seen pens, pencils, lunch boxes, and backpacks with the Powerpuff Girls on them. Laura has a talking Buttercup doll, dog tags, pens, pencils, and Powerpuff stuffed animals and Beanie Babies. By the end of the year, stores hope to sell more than $200 million worth of Powerpuff stuff to kids and their parents. But the powerful Powerpuff Girls aren't stopping there. A movie is planned for 2002."	4
Although he never went to college like the kids in this story, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart was a prodigy. A prodigy is someone who shows remarkable talent as a child. Mozart was born in 1756 in Austria, a country in Europe. By the age of 5, Mozart was writing music and performing in concerts. By the age of 13, he had written several operas and symphonies. A symphony is a piece of music written to be played by many instruments, such as violins, violas, cellos, French horns, and flutes.	4
"Over the years, prunes have gotten a bad name. The strange-looking fruit is wrinkled and shriveled up, and some people think prunes taste bad, even though they've never tried them. The California Prune Board (CPB) now wants to convince people that prunes taste good and are good for them. To help spread the word, the federal government has given the CPB permission to change the name of the fruit. Prunes are actually dried plums, and that's what the board wants to call them--dried plums. California produces 70 percent of all the prunes sold worldwide. The CPB hopes the name change will increase sales of dried plums. The prune is not the first fruit to get a new name to help market it. Kiwifruit was once known as the Chinese gooseberry. ""I've eaten prunes,"" said one 8-year-old. ""My teacher gave us some in class, and they tasted really good."" Would dried plums taste even better than prunes?"	4
"By now, everyone knows that cigarettes are addictive, which means people can develop a need for them that is very hard to get rid of. However, until recently, no studies had measured how addictive. For many years, scientists believed it took a fairly long time for smokers to become addicted to nicotine. Last year, however, a study conducted by the University of Massachusetts showed that young smokers can become addicted to nicotine in only a few days or weeks. The new study worries many doctors. ""This is particularly disturbing, given that each day, over 4,800 [U.S.] teens smoke their first cigarette. That's 1.7 million children annually,"" said Dr. Joseph DiFranza, who led the study. He added that those ""kids will take about 20 years on average to break this addiction. We need to take the problem of smoking and adolescents much more seriously than we have."""	4
Governor George W. Bush says he will enforce current civil rights laws, laws made to protect the personal rights of people. He also says that education is the best way to end racism. He wants to improve all schools. He also wants to work with civil rights groups, such as the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP). Vice President Al Gore wants to continue affirmative action programs, programs that help African Americans and other minorities. He wants more money to enforce civil rights laws. Gore also says increasing the minimum wage, the lowest amount an employer can pay employees, would help African Americans. He wants all people to have access to better schools.	4
"Last summer, lightning flashed and thunder boomed in Great Yarmouth, England. Then fish, yes, fish, rained from the sky. ""At first I thought I might have something wrong with my eyes,"" said Fred Hodgkins. ""The fish were all dead, but they looked fresh, as if they had come out of the sea."" The fish had come from the sea--the North Sea. A small tornado had picked up the fish, carried them 2 miles, and dropped them on the town."	4
"Rebecca Fyfe was happy when her boyfriend gave her a cell phone. But she didn't know that the phone would save her life. Shortly after leaving Bali, the boat's engines stopped working and the boat began to drift. Rough weather and waves battered the boat, which started taking on water. Without a radio, the boaters couldn't call for help. Fyfe, however, had her cell phone with her. Its batteries were low, so she was afraid to make a call. Instead, she used the phone's keypad to send an e-mail to her boyfriend, Nick Hodgson, who was in England, thousands of miles away. She typed, ""Call... Coast Guard, we need help--S.O.S."" Hodgson called the Coast Guard in Thames, England. The Coast Guard then contacted rescuers in Australia and Indonesia, and a rescue operation was put together. Rescuers located the drifting boat and carried the passengers to safety after they had spent more than 30 hours at sea."	4
Almost everyone in the nation had an opinion about whether Cuban refugee Elián González should stay in the United States or return home. A U.S. federal court decided he could return to Cuba. On June 28, he went home.	4
Couch potatoes everywhere love their remote controls. They can channel-surf by barely lifting a finger. Now a company wants to make surfing the Web just as easy as channel-surfing on TV. A new company called PlanetPortal has invented WebRemote, which is a cross between a TV remote and a video game control pad. WebRemote makes navigating the Web as easy as pressing a button. In the past, Net surfers had to type in long, difficult Web addresses to find their favorite sites. Now they can program WebRemote with their favorite Web addresses in the same way they program a telephone with phone numbers. With WebRemote, couch potatoes can surf the Web and channel-surf without leaving the comfort of their sofas. Now someone needs to invent a remote that will bring soft drinks and snacks from the refrigerator.	4
"Richard Rodriguez recently set a new world's record for riding a roller coaster. He rode a coaster for 2,000 bone-rattling hours. That's about 22,655 miles. To set the record, Rodriguez (front) rode a roller coaster at Blackpool Pleasure Beach, an amusement park in England, for 22 hours a day for 90 days. After setting the record, Rodriguez said, ""It was a small step for me, but a giant roller coaster ride for mankind."" Setting records for riding roller coasters isn't new to Rodriguez. He set his first record in 1977, when he rode a coaster for 103 hours and 55 minutes. He has broken that record many times in the last 23 years."	4
"Have you seen a 6-foot-tall statue that has red hair and red nose and is wearing a yellow outfit with big, floppy red shoes? If so, the police in Normal, Illinois, want to talk to you. They're looking for a statue of Ronald McDonald that was stolen from a McDonald's restaurant. Police say this is the third time that the statue has been stolen in the last five years. A spokesperson for the McDonald's restaurant isn't sure how the statue was removed from the restaurant grounds. ""The guys who put the statue in [after the last time it was taken] said there was no way he was going to be taken again,"" the spokesperson said. But the installers were wrong. The people who stole the statue may think that the theft is a prank. But they broke the law by stealing someone else's property. McDonald's wants Ronald back. The restaurant is offering a $250 reward for information on the missing statue's whereabouts."	4
"People often take trips on our nation's roads and highways. But recently, several sections of an old road went on a trip of their own. Last month, workers in Oklahoma loaded about a dozen pieces of historic Route 66 onto trucks. Each of the 3,000-pound pieces then made a 1,400-mile trip to Washington, D.C., where they will become part of an exhibit at the Smithsonian National Museum of American History. Route 66 has been called the ""Main Street of America."" It once stretched 2,400 miles, from Chicago, Illinois, to Los Angeles, California. The road connected eight states: Illinois, Missouri, Kansas, Oklahoma, Texas, New Mexico, Arizona, and California. In the 1920s, engineer Cyrus Stevens Avery of Tulsa, Oklahoma, envisioned a road connecting the Midwest and the Pacific Ocean. During the 1930s, Route 66 was completed and was soon lined with hundreds of businesses. In the past few decades, however, Route 66 has fallen into disrepair, and parts of the old route have been dug up. Today, drivers use faster superhighways to get where they were going. Even though fewer people drive on Route 66 now, many people still think of the road as the Main Street of America. That's why the National Museum of American History wants to include the road in its new exhibit, ""America on the Move."" The exhibit is scheduled to open in 2003."	4
"Would it be fair if the boys in your class could vote for class president and the girls couldn't? Believe it or not, for a long time, that's how election laws stood in the United States--men could vote and women could not. That all changed in 1920, when women gained the right to vote. This year, all Americans are celebrating the 81st anniversary of that victory. In 1848, two women, Lucretia Mott and Elizabeth Cady Stanton, organized a meeting of several hundred women and dozens of men in Seneca Falls, New York. The group said that women were not represented; they did not have a voice in the U.S. government. The group said that elected officials represented only the people who elected them--men. The group wrote a declaration, or a statement of purpose, based on the Declaration of Independence. The Declaration of Sentiment listed the rights of women and was signed by 68 women and 32 men. It began, ""We hold these truths to be self-evident: that all men and women are created equal."" The declaration launched a fight for suffrage, or the right to vote. In 1872, Susan B. Anthony tried to vote in Rochester, New York. She was arrested. By 1907, tens of thousands of women were marching in protest parades in many communities, including Washington, D.C. By 1920, many Americans agreed that keeping women from voting was unfair. In August 1920, the required number of states had ratified, or approved, the 19th Amendment to the Constitution. That amendment states, ""The right of citizens of the United States to vote shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any State on account of sex."""	4
"It's a sad day in the neighborhood. Fred Rogers, the host of Mr. Rogers' Neighborhood, has said that he will tape the last show in the long-running TV series this year. Rogers, who has been on TV for 50 years, has starred in Mr. Rogers' Neighborhood for 33 years. In all, Rogers, who is 71 years old, has made about 1,000 episodes of the show. (Your parents may have watched the show when they were growing up!) Over the years, the TV show has discussed many issues that are important to kids. David Newell plays deliveryman Mr. McFeely on the program. He said Rogers made shows about ""subjects such as a new baby [in a family] or dealing with angry feelings."" Even though Rogers will no longer make new episodes of his famous TV show, he is not retiring. Rogers said he will continue to make special Web sites and museum shows. His old episodes will be rerun for years to come."	4
"Samantha Redden knew she had to do something and do it fast. Samantha, age 12, and 40 other students were riding their school bus to school in Minnesota when their bus driver, Willis Walstad, passed out. The bus swerved out of control. ""I had butterflies in my stomach,"" Samantha said. ""I was thinking, 'I have to shut the bus off because he [Walstad] is going to run into a house or a car.' I was kind of freaked out."" ""I was screaming at him to put his foot on the brake,"" Samantha said. ""He just looked at me with his eyes half shut."" Walstad didn't understand what was happening because he was ill. Samantha knew she had to stop the runaway bus. ""I put my foot on the brake and turned the key off."" Samantha and the other kids on the bus are heroes. They stopped their runaway bus. ""Samantha and the other students acted as individuals and a group to solve a dangerous situation,"" said Jerry Hansen, the principal at Samantha's elementary school. Hansen, who was once a bus driver, told Weekly Reader that driving a bus is a serious job. He thinks that bus passengers can help their driver by being ""polite, quiet, and in their seats."""	4
"On average, kids ages 4 to 12 receive $18 a week. Here's how kids get that money: Many adults think that kids spend their money as soon as they get it. That may be true for some young people, but not for 9-year-old twins Gabriel and Dylan Greene. For the past three years, Gabriel and Dylan have taken part in Save for America. Save for America is a program that teaches kids the importance of saving money. The program also teaches kids how to save money. Last year, 750 schools and 90,000 kids took part in Save for America. Combined, those kids saved $1 million. Since the program began 12 years ago, kids have saved nearly $50 million! One of the schools that takes part in the Save for America program is Setauket Elementary School, Setauket, New York. Every two weeks that school has Banking Day. Nearly 200 kids from the school deposit money on Banking Day, including Gabriel and Dylan. Each boy deposits about $5 in his bank account on Banking Day. So far, Gabriel has saved $350, and Dylan has saved $340. The kids who participate in Save for America save money and learn valuable lessons that they will use for the rest of their lives. Dylan explained that he has learned that saving money for the future can help him obtain the things he wants and lead a better life as an adult. Save for America also helps kids sharpen their math skills. Gabriel said the program has improved his skills, especially in addition, subtraction, and multiplication. The kids who take part in Save for America can use their money for a variety of things. Gabriel recently withdrew some of his savings to buy a new scooter. However, he's saving most of his money for college. Dylan also has reasons for saving his money. ""You should save up all the money that you need,"" he said, ""and you should give some of the money [to] the kids in America that need more [food, clothes and other necessities]."""	4
"If you have any doubt that reading can help save lives, you haven't read about an amazing fourth grader, Brandon Lecher. On October 3, he saved a classmate from choking to death. And he did this because he had read a story in Weekly Reader! The student had seen the principal choking during lunch and had used the Heimlich maneuver to clear the principal's throat. The Heimlich maneuver is a quick and easy way to clear the throat of a person who is choking. At the time he read the story, Brandon didn't think he would ever need to use the Heimlich maneuver. But what he learned from the article later helped him save a life. ""I saw Joseph choking on a potato chip,"" Brandon recently told Weekly Reader. ""His face was turning red and blue, and he was holding his throat."" Then Brandon remembered reading about the Heimlich maneuver in Weekly Reader. ""It just came to my mind. When my class read about it, it sounded like an interesting subject, so I paid attention,"" Brandon said. ""That's when I did the Heimlich maneuver. I was scared, but I remembered what to do."" Joseph doesn't remember much about the experience except being frightened and seeing Brandon jump out of his seat. ""I was really scared,"" Joseph said, but ""Brandon got up and saved my life."" What did Joseph learn from the experience? ""I learned that you should chew your food slowly and that you should also learn about the Heimlich maneuver. You might have to use it on somebody."" Grab your fist with your other hand. Press it in with an upward thrust. Repeat until victim stops choking."	4
About 30 years ago, one of the most popular cartoons on TV was Scooby-Doo, Where Are You? Now 2 million kids and adults watch the crime-fighting dog and his gang each week in reruns. Scooby's spooky adventures and woofy way of messing up words are still making people laugh. Scooby-Doo is so popular that Hollywood moviemakers may make a movie based on the cartoon series. So far, two of Hollywood's coolest stars, Sarah Michelle Gellar and Freddie Prinze Jr., say they are interested in the Scooby-Doo movie. Gellar says she would play Daphne Blake, and Prinze would play Fred Jones. With those two roles possibly filled, the search is on for actors to play Velma, Shaggy, and Scooby. Who do you think should play those roles?	4
"Scooters are one of the hottest fads in the country. But as the number of kids who zip around on the silver scooters skyrockets, so does the number of injuries. Doctors reported treating 9,400 scooter-related injuries in the United States between January and August 2000. According to the National Safe Kids Campaign, children younger than 15 were hurt in nine out of ten of those accidents. In one-third of those scooter accidents, the rider fell and broke or dislocated an arm or a hand. Safety gear helps protect riders, who usually ride at about 4 miles per hour. But some people cruise at speeds of 25 miles per hour or more. In England, police gave a man a ticket for racing a scooter at 39 miles per hour! The number of scooter-related accidents has prompted some U.S. communities to pass laws requiring kids who ride scooters to wear helmets and other safety gear. Many states already have helmet laws for kids who ride bicycles, and some have helmet laws for kids who use skateboards and in-line skates. Ann Brown, an official with the Consumer Product Safety Commission, recommends that kids use safety gear when riding scooters. ""We're trying to head off some of the kinds of injuries that happen with in-line skates,"" Brown said about scooter safety. ""We want people to know about the safety gear early on."" This isn't the first time scooters have been popular. Scooters have been around since 1816. According to Annette Thompson of the Bicycle Museum of America, the first scooter was made from a board and two large wheels. Even if scooter riders are careful, accidents can happen. Here are a few safety tips that scooter riders can use: In the 1930s, kids nailed roller skates to milk crates to make homemade scooters. Scooters remained popular until the 1980s, when skateboards and in-line skates became popular."	4
About 66 years ago, Walt Disney was working on a new movie, Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs. To make the movie, he had to name all seven dwarfs. The Disney Company now says Sleepy, Dopey, and Bashful almost had different names. Today, the names of the seven tiny miners seem perfect, but Disney had a hard time coming up with them. He thought of 50 names before he settled on the seven we know. It's hard to imagine Snow White or the dwarfs whistling while they worked with Dirty or Dumpy. Can you picture a dwarf named Awful or Crabby being much fun? In the end, neither could Disney, and he came up with the names you know today.	4
One morning in February, 75,000 kids woke up to find that they had become U.S. citizens. The kids, who were all adopted from other countries, became citizens because of the Child Citizenship Act. The U.S. Congress passed the act last year. As a result, as of February 27,2001, the United States will grant citizenship to adopted kids who are under 18 years old and have one parent who is a citizen. Every year, U.S. families adopt about 20,000 kids from foreign lands. Kids who were adopted from other countries were not considered U.S. citizens right away. Sometimes, they had to wait years before they could become citizens. The Child Citizenship Act was written by Rep. William Delahunt. Years ago, he adopted a child, Kara, from Vietnam and knows firsthand how hard it can be for an adopted child to become a citizen. He hopes that the act will encourage more U.S. families to adopt kids from other lands.	4
"Palm Beach, Florida. While surfing, Matt Kraskiewicz, age 17, felt something tug on his leg. ""It was like someone dropped a weight on my foot,"" he said. That weight was a shark taking a bite out of Matt's leg. Volusia County, Florida. Eleven-year-old Taylor Holley was standing in waist-deep water when a shark suddenly bit his leg, leaving a 2-inch gash. Should humans be afraid of sharks, or should sharks be afraid of humans? Debate this issue. The above incidents took place in Florida during October. After reading such stories, many people might think that they should not swim in Florida's waters. But shark experts say that would be an overreaction. As scary as they are, shark attacks are rare. The International Shark Attack File (ISAF) says you are more likely to be hit by lightning than be bitten by one of the more than 350 shark species. In fact, each year about 500 people are hurt by lightning in the United States. In 1999, only 58 shark attacks occurred worldwide. Shark Expert Rodney Fox explained, ""Sharks do not like humans; we are too bony. A lot of people who have been bitten by sharks have survived because the shark spat them out."" Sharks that do bite humans have often mistaken people for other kinds of animals. For example, ISAF officials say sharks attack surfers wearing dark-colored wetsuits more often than they do anyone else. To a shark, the wetsuits make surfers look like seals, a favorite food. Shark Catches in U.S. Waters One of the biggest threats to sharks, said Burgess, is finning. Finning happens when a fisher catches a shark, cuts off its fins, and tosses the dead fish overboard. The fins are used to make delicacies such as shark fin soup. Conservation groups are urging governments to protect sharks. During the summer, the U.S. House of Representatives acted to protect sharks when it passed a bill that could prevent finning in U.S. waters. In order for that bill to become law, the U.S. Senate has to pass it, and the president must sign it. U.S. Rep. Randy Cunningham introduced the bill. ""We must end the harmful and wasteful practice of shark finning,"" Cunningham said."	4

"Kim Corbin of California skips everywhere she goes. She skips to work, she skips to the store, and she skips home. As she skips around town, Corbin shouts, ""Skippers, skip on!"" Corbin got hooked on skipping in April 1999 when she began skipping with a friend. As she skipped, she thought, ""This is happiness."" Since that time, Corbin has founded her own organization dedicated to getting people to skip. So far, 1,000 people in 32 cities have become skipping enthusiasts. Soon, Corbin will skip into classrooms across the United States. She plans to take her message that skipping is a fun and healthful activity to school-children in 38 states. Corbin says skipping can be part of an exercise program. She wants to get kids and their parents to skip and do other exercises together. Corbin has lost 25 pounds since she started skipping two years ago. Corbin says that she makes skipping into a game. ""Just sneak in five steps wherever you are, and no one is even going to notice it,"" she advised."	4
"On New Year's Day 2001, Irene Alexander and 2,538 other people gathered at Mount Vernon, George Washington's home in Virginia. They came to honor the slaves who had worked there. On New Year's Day 200 years earlier, 123 of George Washington's slaves had been freed. Washington's widow, Martha, freed her husband's slaves on January 1, 1801. Martha was carrying out the wishes of the country's first president, who had died on December 14, 1799. In his will he had requested that his slaves be freed after his wife's death. Jennifer Saxon, a spokesperson for Mount Vernon, told Weekly Reader that Mount Vernon couldn't have prospered without slave labor. ""Slaves did most of the work,"" she said. When Washington was born, many Americans owned slaves. Those people used slaves to plant crops and perform many other duties. Most people thought slavery was OK. When Washington was 11 years old, his father died and left him ten slaves. During the American Revolution, which began in 1775, some people began to think that slavery was wrong and should be ended. Washington was one of those people. He vowed never to buy another slave. In his will, Washington wrote that all his slaves should be freed. ""Upon the [death] of my wife,"" he wrote, ""it is my...desire that all the slaves which I hold in my own right shall receive their freedom."" To make sure Washington's wishes were carried out, Martha freed his slaves in 1801, a year before she died. Martha, however, kept the slaves she owned when she freed her husband's slaves. Even though Washington freed the slaves he owned, slavery remained legal in some states for another 64 years, until 1865. Slavery did not end in the United States until after the Civil War ended it."	4
"In December, Weekly Reader told you that kids are not getting enough sleep. Now a new report shows that kids are not alone. About two-thirds of U.S. adults say that they do not get eight hours of sleep a night, according to the 2001 Sleep in America Poll by the National Sleep Foundation (NSF). Those adults also said that they often are not fully awake when they drive and that they find it hard to stay awake while at work. According to the report, more than half of adults drive while drowsy, and nearly two out of ten say they have fallen asleep at the wheel. ""There is an epidemic of sleepiness in our society,"" said James Walsh, vice president of the NSF. ""People may be getting sleep, but it is at school, at work, and behind the wheel."""	4
The number of collisions between powerboats and manatees has been on the rise since 1976, according to the Save the Manatee Club. In that time, close to 1,000 manatees have died from collisions with powerboats. Thousands of others have been injured. In 2000, collisions caused 38 percent of manatee deaths in Florida. To curb those collisions, Florida has already passed laws that limit a boat's speed to under 10 miles per hour in areas where manatees are found. Now, police are beefing up patrols and cracking down on waterway speeders.	4
"""The Rock"" tosses an opponent out of the ring. BAM! ""Triple H"" leaps from the corner post onto his foe. Each week, millions of kids and adults tune in to TV wrestling shows to watch ""The Rock,"" ""Triple H,"" and other pro wrestlers. Pro wrestling now has a larger audience than ever before. Diane Levin of Wheelock College studies how TV violence affects kids. She says watching wrestling might make kids think that it is all right to solve problems with violence. ""Kids see adults cheering violent behavior. Then kids are told hitting people is bad. So it confuses them,"" she said. Levin also said kids don't know that pro wrestling is really an act. The action is planned ahead of time so that the wrestlers can avoid hurting one another, she said. Wrestlers also say pro wrestling is acting. ""The more you act, the more you [convince] the audience that what they're seeing is real,"" ""The Rock"" wrote in his book, The Rock Says.... Many wrestling fans say the critics are too serious. ""[Wrestling] is a fun way to [relax],"" said Malinda Anderson, who watches pro wrestling with her two children, ages 6 and 10. ""My kids would have a fit if it were taken off the air,"" she said. Anderson said she has talked to her kids about the violence in pro wrestling programs. ""I told my kids how to watch [pro wrestling],"" she explained. ""I told them that it's just a big show, that these wrestlers are not killing each other. The way your kids see [pro wrestling] is all in the way you explain it to them."" On TV, pro wrestling may look violent, but wrestlers are seldom seriously injured. In backyards across the country, however, kids and adults are trying out pro wrestling moves--and winding up in hospitals. Some backyard wrestlers have been seriously injured, and at least two kids have been killed. Most pro wrestlers learn their moves from trainers at wrestling schools. The most important lesson is how to fall without getting hurt. ""All it takes is one wrong landing, and you could be paralyzed for life,"" said Roland Alexander, the owner of a wrestling school."	4
It's hatching time. About every three years, female rattlesnakes lay eggs. Those eggs hatch between August and October, when the baby snakes break through their soft shells and start to slither around. Baby rattlesnakes don't have rattles until weeks after they hatch. The rattles form over time as the snakes repeatedly shed their skin. A baby rattlesnake sheds its skin for the first time about two weeks after it hatches. A rattlesnake shakes its rattle to warn other animals that it is nearby. Many baby rattlesnakes don't live to become adults. Because of the babies' small size, other animals prey on them, or eat them. Raccoons, hawks, and many other animals eat baby rattlesnakes. If a rattlesnake lives to become an adult, it can grow to be 6 feet long and live for 20 to 30 years.	4
What's your favorite kind of soup? Some people like tomato soup, some like vegetable soup, others like chicken soup, and still others like New England clam chowder. According to a recent study, your favorite soup tells a lot about you. Brian Wansink, a professor at the University of Illinois, recently asked people what their favorite soup is. He then asked the same people to describe their personalities. Here's what he learned about people who like soup:	4
"On a field trip last June to the Connecticut state capitol, a group of students from Myrtle S. Stevens Elementary School made an observation. Now, almost a year later, that observation may lead to a new state fruit for Connecticut. It all started when teacher Gloria Earls and her fourth graders from Rocky Hill were taking a tour of the capitol, the building where the state government offices are. The students noticed that the state seal (a symbol of the state) and the state flag had grapes on them. When they asked if grapes were the state fruit, the kids were told by officials that there is no official state fruit. The students decided that they wanted the grape to be made the state fruit. Nicole Saponare said, ""We thought it would be cool to send in a petition"" to have grapes become the official fruit. After gathering signatures from other students, Earls's students sent a petition to their state senator. The senator then presented a bill in the state legislature to make grapes the official state fruit. Although no action has been taken yet, the bill is still being discussed. Not everyone supports the students' actions, however. Apple growers in Connecticut have said that apples should be the official fruit of the state. ""Apples are not native to Connecticut,"" fifth grader Jessica Chudzik argued. ""Grapes are native to Connecticut."" Katie Matthews added that grapes are already on the seal and the flag; apples are not."	4
"Spencer Breslin may be only 8 years old, but he has already worked as much as many adult actors. Spencer has starred in 40 commercials, a TV miniseries, and two movies! You might have seen Spencer recently in the Disney movie The Kid. Spencer began his acting career when he was about 3 years old. A talent agent, a person who looks for actors, saw Spencer at a playground in New York City, where Spencer lives. The agent told Spencer's mom that Spencer could probably act in commercials. Shortly after that, he began his acting career. What does Spencer want to do when he grows up? Spencer plans on doing lots of different things. ""I'd like to be a cop or a secret agent--maybe even a [movie] director, but I will always love acting,"" he said in a recent interview."	4
It's going to be a spicy fall. Sporty, Posh, Scary, and Baby Spice are back. The members of the Spice Girls, who are from England, split up to pursue individual careers. But now the group is planning on releasing a new album in November. But the spice cabinet is missing one spice. Ginger decided not to return to the group.	4
"Last October, the Piscataway Board of Education voted to limit the amount of homework kids get. For kids in elementary school, homework is limited to 30 minutes a weeknight. For kids in high school, the amount of homework is limited to two hours a weeknight. Those parents have argued that heavy loads of homework leave kids little time for other activities. In addition, some parents say that homework assignments are so tough that they have to hire tutors to help their kids with homework. Before the school board in Piscataway acted, parents there had been concerned about the amount of homework assigned by teachers. ""[Kids] are in school for six-and-a-half hours a day,"" said parent Cheryl Weaver. ""They don't need to come home and do another two or three hours of homework. That's more than a full-time job."" Many educators worry about cutting down on homework. They say that limiting homework could mean limiting learning. Some educators say that even a light load of homework helps kids learn and do well in school. The Educational Resources Information Center the of U.S. Department of Education has released a report about homework and its impact on students. Many companies across the United States have developed Web sites aimed at helping kids with their homework. Many of those Web companies hire teachers to help kids come up with the answers to questions. Here are two such sites. According to the department's report, homework helps students in many ways. For example, homework helps students become interested in different subjects, teaches them responsibility, and improves their classroom work. In short, homework helps students do better in school and get better grades. Some students agree with the experts. New York resident Kaitlin Ofman, 12, notes that although she sometimes has a lot of homework, she still feels that there is a benefit to doing it. ""I understand that homework is important,"" Kaitlin said. ""After we learn something in school, we might forget it if we [didn't] have any practice in it,"" she said."	4
"Julie, age 9, looked serious as she described what happened to her recently while riding on the bus to school. ""My mom and I had bought these shoes that I really liked,"" Julie told Weekly Reader. ""But then these kids started teasing me about them. I felt embarrassed. After that, I didn't want to take the bus anymore."" Scenes like that take place every day at bus stops, on school buses, on school playgrounds, and in other places. A recent survey found that 55 of every 100 kids between ages 8 and 11 said bullying and teasing are a ""big problem"" for kids their age. The survey results also show that 74 percent of kids between ages 8 and 11 said they have seen bullying in their school. The survey was conducted by Children Now, the Kaiser Family Foundation, and Nickelodeon. ""Bullying is the repeated harassment of someone that takes place over a period of time,"" said Ronald Stephens. To harass means to constantly pester or threaten someone. Stephens heads the National Center for School Safety, which works to prevent violence in schools. Bullying can take many forms, such as hitting, name-calling, threatening looks, and spoken threats, Stephens said. ""Bullying can have long-term effects,"" he said, ""including the 'vigilante effect.'"" A vigilante is a person who takes the law into his or her own hands. So if a bullied student feels a school isn't helping, that student may act out against others, he said. Bullying may be one of the causes behind some of the recent shootings in U.S. schools, according to Stephens. Kids at Santana High School, in Santee, California, said bullying may have a part in a recent shooting there. Santee student Charles ""Andy"" Williams, age 15, is accused of killing two boys and wounding 13 other people at Santana High School on March 5. According to schoolmates, in addition to having other personal problems, Williams had been bullied and teased. To stop bullying, some schools have organized peer mediation groups. A peer mediation group allows students who have problems getting along to work the problems out with the help of peers and teachers. Other schools have sent students and teachers forms asking questions about such problems as bullying and teasing. The answers from the forms help school leaders and parents become more aware of kids' problems and figure out ways to solve them. Finally, Stephens suggests that there are steps a student who is bullied can take. ""Make it clear that you don't like being bullied and then walk away and tell an adult,"" Stephens said. If a person is bullying you, tell the person in a firm, loud voice that you don't like what they are doing. Then..."	4
Where might you find out what the current temperature is at the South Pole? Where might you find out when 'N Sync will be coming to your town? The number of kids who use the Net has exploded in the past few years. According to studies by eMarketer, an Internet company that studies who uses the Net, the number of U.S. kids between ages 5 and 13 going online at home will grow from 11 million in 1999 to 22 million in 2003. Not all kids are surfing the Internet safely. Many kids are giving out information that they shouldn't reveal on the Net, such as their real last names, addresses, and phone numbers. Some kids have online conversations with people who mean them harm or could get them into trouble. According to the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), you can have fun on the Net without putting yourself at risk if you stick to the following rules. The FBI says:	4
Scientists say the Milky Way is sweet. No, we're not talking about the candy bar; we're talking about the galaxy in which we live. Scientists say they recently discovered a cloud of sugar near the center of the Milky Way galaxy. Most known space clouds are made of gases such as hydrogen, helium, and carbon. But this amazing cloud is made of sugar--that's right, sugar. The Milky Way is a huge galaxy shaped like a pinwheel. It has a central core surrounded by spiral arms. Our sun is one of the stars in the Milky Way. It is located in one of the galaxy's arms. The sugar cloud is about 26,000 light-years from Earth. That means that a beam of light takes 26,000 years to travel from Earth to the cloud.	4
Governor Bush says that roughly one-quarter of the government budget surplus (extra money), which comes from taxes, should be returned to the people. He says his plan would promote economic growth and help people lead better lives by cutting high tax rates. The plan would lower the tax rate for married couples and families with children. He says the 6 million poorest families would pay no taxes. Vice President Gore wants to lower taxes, but not by the amount Bush wants to. He says some of the surplus money is needed to support Social Security, a program that helps older people. Gore also wants to pay the debt the United States owes. He wants to cut taxes for married couples and make it easier for people of all ages to set aside money for education.	4
All year, Weekly Reader has reported on amazing kids. Here's a story about an amazing delivery. Tommy Davidson's family was expecting a baby. They weren't expecting the baby's birthday to turn out as it did. On March 7, Tommy's dad left the family's house in Michigan to pick up an aunt to watch the children so he could take Tommy's mother to the hospital. Tommy, age 8, and Malik, age 2, waited at home with their mother. Shortly after Tommy's dad left the house, Tommy's mom told him the baby was coming. Tommy picked up his family's cordless phone and dialed 911. He told the operator that his mother was having a baby. The emergency operator and Tommy's mother told Tommy how to deliver the baby. After the baby was born, Tommy used a shoelace from one of his shoes to tie off the baby's umbilical cord.	4
When the massive ship HMS Titanic set sail for the first time in the spring of 1912, many people said the ship was unsinkable. Just a few days into its North Atlantic Ocean journey, however, the Titanic slammed into an iceberg and sank to the bottom of the ocean on April 15-- never to sail again. Now, if a multimillionaire in South Africa has his way, a replica, or copy, of the Titanic may sail again. Sarel Gous plans to raise more than $575 million to build a new version of the Titanic. He wants to start building the ship this summer. The replica of the Titanic will have many similarities to the ship that sank 89 years ago. Gous wants the companies that made the silverware, carpets, tablecloths, and bed linens for the original Titanic to supply those items for the replica. The replica will not be exactly like the original Titanic, however. It will be 230 feet longer than the original, and it will have modern features, such as movie theaters. Cruising aboard the ship will also cost more than it did in 1912. Rooms on the Titanic II may cost $10,000 a night!	4
"""I encourage all young people to take care of their bodies and [avoid] using tobacco, drugs, or alcohol. With clear minds, young people can achieve their goals and dreams."" George W. Bush wants a federal law similar to a Texas state law. The Texas law makes stores that sell cigarettes to minors pay the state money as punishment. Bush also wants to stop tobacco companies from advertising their products near schools and churches. Al Gore has accused tobacco companies of persuading teenagers to smoke cigarettes as a way of replacing the 400,000 people who die each year from smoking-related illnesses. He wants to make sure that tobacco companies cannot advertise to kids. Gore also wants to make it harder for kids to buy cigarettes."	4
"In many ways, David Bocchichio is a typical teacher. He works long hours, and students say he is always available to help. But he has given more than time and knowledge. He recently gave one of his kidneys to the mother of three of his students. Evelyn Arroyo is the mother of three girls who were students at Hockanum Elementary School in East Hartford, Connecticut, where Bocchichio teaches. Last year, Bocchichio learned from Arroyo's daughters, Leslie, Juanita, and Iris, that their mother was sick with kidney disease. The diagram shows some of the organs in the human body. The diagram shows the kidneys in front of other body organs so you can see them. The kidneys are actually behin these organs. The kidneys filter waste from the body and make urine. Although a person has two kidneys, he or she needs only one to stay alive. People who have diseased kidneys may need a kidney transplant to stay alive. In a kidney transplant operation, doctors remove the diseased kidney and replace it with a working kidney. In the United States, many people suffer from kidney disease. According to Arroyo's doctor, David Hull, more than 47,000 people are waiting for kidney transplants. For many of those people, finding a kidney is a problem. Some of Evelyn Arroyo's relatives offered a kidney, but their kidneys did not match the tissue that made up Arroyo's kidneys. Arroyo's family feared she might die before a matching kidney was found. That's when Bocchichio volunteered one of his kidneys, which matched Arroyo's tissue. During the operations, which took place in January, doctors removed one of Bocchichio's kidneys and put it inside Arroyo. Word of the operations' success quickly spread through Hockanum Elementary School. ""I am very proud of what he has done,"" Principal Ismael A. Torres told Weekly Reader. ""The students now look at him, at all their teachers, as people who care about them and their parents."""	4
"Erin Beth Turner of West Hartford, Connecticut, was among the millions of kids who bought Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire this summer. After buying her copy, the 10-year-old told Weekly Reader, ""I'll read it until I go to bed, and finish it in a few days."" The four Harry Potter books, by J.K. Rowling, are popular all over the world. More than 35 million copies have been sold. They have also been translated into 30 languages. Many teachers say that their students don't read enough. So teachers are thrilled that many kids spend their free time reading Harry Potter books. Educators say reading helps kids do better in school. ""I know my kids aren't missing out on their reading,"" said Gillian Williams, an elementary school principal in New York City. ""They're reading Harry Potter."" The books also teach kids new words. Megan LeMay, 10, of West Hartford, told Weekly Reader that as she reads, ""I write new words down and look them up in a dictionary."" Although Harry has cast a spell on kids, some people fear it's an evil spell. The school board in Zeeland, Michigan, decided teachers couldn't read the books to students. Not everyone in Zeeland agreed with that decision. Weekly Reader recently talked to people in Zeeland about Harry. Some Zeeland parents said they worry that Harry teaches kids to question parents and other authority figures. They also said that many of the characters don't have good values. ""The books don't have characters that are easy to respect,"" said parent Mary Elzinga. Other parents in Zeeland had no problem with the books. Parent Mary Ocherse said kids should question some authority figures. Teacher Mary Dana agreed. ""Some of our greatest American heroes, such as George Washington, questioned authority,"" she said. ""We need to teach kids how and when to question authority figures."" Dana also said the characters in the books are good role models kids can relate to. ""Harry is an outsider who is honest and is a good friend,"" she said. ""He makes mistakes, but he always tries to do the right thing."" When asked their opinion, Erin, Megan, and many other kids said they don't understand what the fuss in Zeeland is about. They all said the Harry Potter books are ""just for fun."" By now, only a muggle* hasn't heard of Harry Potter. He is an orphan with messy hair and a lightning-bolt-shaped scar on his forehead. He lives in England with his mean uncle and aunt. When he was 10, Harry was invited to attend the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. The books are about Harry's adventures at Hogwarts. Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire is the fourth book in the series. Author J.K. Rowling plans to write seven books about Harry, one for each year he attends Hogwarts."	4
"What do Pinocchio and The Rugrats Movie have in common? Both movies were made for kids and are rated G, which means they are OK for everyone to watch. But two scientists say those movies and many others should be rated ""V"" for their violent content. The two scientists--Kimberly Thompson and Fumie Yokota--work for Harvard University. They watched 74 G-rated movies and said, ""We were surprised that every single movie had some act of violence."" The violence in the movies ranged from insults to attacks. The two scientists also found that, in 46 of the movies, at least one character was hurt. And they found that, in 37 of the movies, at least one character was killed. Most of the movies contained nearly ten minutes of violence, the scientists said. The most violent movie the scientists watched was Quest for Camelot. That movie has 24 minutes of violence, Thompson and Yokota said. Violent programs can also be found on TV. The Media in the Home Survey, conducted by the Annenberg Public Policy Center, recently found that more than one-quarter of all children's TV shows had four or more violent scenes in each episode. Some scientists say that watching too many violent TV shows and movies could make some kids violent. Watching violent shows could make some kids ""think it's no big deal for somebody to be smacked in the head with a hammer,"" said Yokota. Scientists also worry that kids might imitate the violent acts they see on TV and in movies. Joanne Cantor, a scientist at the University of Wisconsin, said TV and movies usually don't show the effects of violence. Instead, shows often make violence look funny. Kids who think violence is funny might hurt other people without thinking about the pain they're causing. You can protect yourself from violent TV shows and movies. First, you can limit the amount of TV you watch. The American Pediatrics Association says kids should watch no more than two hours of TV a day. Next, watch TV and movies with your parents. Talk with your parents about what you are watching on TV, and discuss what would happen if the same things happened in real life. You and your parents can use the Internet, magazines, and newspapers to learn more about TV shows and movies. For instance, you can read TV and movie reviews on the ""Kids-in-Mind"" and ""Screen It"" Web sites."	4
A new study shows that kids who have a TV in their bedrooms get less sleep than other kids. Sleep experts at Brown University say about 30 percent of kids have a TV in their bedrooms.	4
The United Nations (U.N.) was formed on October 24, 1945, with 51 member nations. Today, 189 countries are members, and much of the U.N.'s work is for the purpose of keeping world peace and solving problems among nations. The U.N. is based in New York City, where the member nations meet from September to December. Just a few of the issues the U.N. deals with include hunger, disease, and lack of schools.

"You've probably heard the old saying, ""An apple a day keeps the doctor away."" If a scientist has his way, in the near future, apples and other fruits and vegetables will help keep millions of kids worldwide healthier than ever. Scientist Charles Arntzen wants to alter fruits and vegetables so that they will contain a vaccine to fight diseases. A vaccine helps a person's body fight diseases. Vaccinations have helped eliminate many diseases in the the United States and other countries. Each year, however, 15 million kids worldwide die from diseases, including hepatitis, cholera, and diarrhea, Arntzen said. Most of the children who get those diseases live in the poorest countries in the world, mainly in Asia, Africa, and South America. Arntzen says it's impossible to send a doctor to vaccinate kids in every village in the world. Even if doctors could go to every village, many poor people couldn't afford to pay for the vaccinations. That's why scientists are working on ways to change fruit and vegetable seeds. They want to make vaccines part of the plants, explained Arntzen. If the scientists are successful, people in poor countries could use the seeds to grow food that would protect them from some diseases. That way, an apple a day would not only keep the doctor away, but would keep deadly diseases away as well."	4
At noon on January 20 in Washington, D.C., George W. Bush will be inaugurated as the 43rd president of the United States. This event marks the end of one of the most closely watched and controversial elections in U.S. history. Bush will put his hand on an open Bible held by the chief justice of the United States. Bush will then recite the same Oath of Office that was spoken by the first U.S. president, George Washington, in 1789. The oath is the president's promise to lead the country. After Bush recites the Oath of Office, he will give a speech that may set the tone of his presidency. Many people will be listening carefully to his speech, because the 2000 presidential election was the source of bitter debate. The first inauguration ceremony was performed in New York City, which was then the nation's capital. On April 30, 1789, George Washington took office. Since then, the ceremony has changed. Thomas Jefferson, the third U.S. president, walked to the White House after his ceremony in 1801. Bush will arrive at the White House in a long parade of limousines and Secret Service vehicles. After Andrew Jackson, the seventh U.S. president, was inaugurated in 1829, he held an open house at the White House. The open house got out of control after the crowd, in a rush to see President Jackson, started breaking furniture and china. Jackson was forced to escape through an open window. Although an open house is expected to be held again this year, it will probably be a more controlled event.	4
"Each year, about 6,000 U.S. kids under age 14 are killed in accidents, according to the SAFE KIDS Campaign. Another 120,000 kids each year are permanently disabled in accidents. ""Summer is the most dangerous time of the year for kids,"" said Dr. C. Everett Koop, who is head of the SAFE KIDS Campaign. Koop added, ""The good news is that families can take simple steps to ensure their kids stay out of emergency rooms."" The 2001 campaign is paying special attention to scooter-related injuries. Because more kids are riding scooters, doctors expect a rise in scooter accidents. In 2000, more than 30,000 people went to emergency rooms for scooter-related injuries, the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission said. Most of those injured were kids age 14 or younger. Because many scooter accidents result in head injuries, some cities and states have passed helmet laws. The New York City passed a law requiring scooter riders under age 14 to wear helmets. Fourth graders from Connecticut, asked their state government to pass a similar law. In 1999, 340,000 kids age 5 to 14 were treated in hospital emergency rooms for bicycle-related injuries, SAFE KIDS reported. The most common bicycle-related injuries are injuries to the head. The best way for kids to protect their heads while riding bikes is by wearing helmets. But the National SAFE KIDS Campaign says only 15 percent to 25 percent of kids who ride bikes wear helmets while riding."	4
"Do you get good grades? Do you talk to your parents about what's happening at school and about things you and your friends are doing after school? A recent study shows that how kids answer those questions tells a lot about whether they are headed for trouble. The study says kids who spend their free time aimlessly often get into trouble. The study, called the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health, was funded by the federal government. More than 90,000 kids between the ages of 12 and 18 took part in the study. Those kids attended 134 different U.S. schools. The study followed them from 1994 to 2000. About half of the kids in the study said they were not involved in dangerous activities. But 25 percent said they had tried a cigarette, 26 percent said they had picked up a gun, and 47 percent said they had tried alcohol. Kids who hang out with friends who drink alcohol, smoke cigarettes, or have tried drugs are likely to do what their friends are doing, said Robert Blum. Blum is one of the doctors who conducted the study. In other words, kids tend to act like their friends, Blum said. Kids should get involved in interesting activities, Blum advised. Instead of hanging out with kids who are already trying what the study calls ""high-risk activities,"" Blum said that kids should play sports, read, talk with parents, or do homework. The National Longitudinal Study finds that kids who are involved in activities usually don't get into trouble. Here's a story written by a Weekly Reader kid reporter about a few kids who know how to spend their time: There are a lot of good kids. I know three of them who live in my hometown, Lockport, Illinois. Amanda Clemmons and Heather Grein are best friends. Recently, they celebrated their birthdays together. The two girls invited about 60 kids to a birthday party. The girls, however, asked their friends to bring pet supplies instead of presents. Their guests brought leashes, paper towels, pet food, treats, kitty litter, and toys to the party. Amanda and Heather then donated the pet supplies to the TLC Animal Shelter in Homer Township."	4
"Residents of Barrow, Alaska, are stunned when a severe thunderstorm roars through town. The storm shocks the town; it is the first thunderstorm they have ever seen. For over 36 hours, a wild blizzard dumps about 100,000 tons of snow on a ski course in Austria. When even the ski lifts stop working, the storm puts a world championship skiing competition on hold. Those are just two of the many cases of wild weather, such as blizzards, tornadoes, hurricanes, and heat waves, that have been taking place around the world. A recent report from the United Nations (U.N.) says that wild weather may become increasingly common worldwide. Certain gases, such as carbon dioxide, settle in Earth's atmosphere. Those gases act like the glass windows in a greenhouse, trapping heat from the sun and causing a rise in temperature. World temperatures have been slowly increasing at least since 1850, when scientists began keeping records of world temperatures. The 1990s were the hottest ten years on record. Scientists aren't sure what is causing global warming. Most scientists agree that burning gasoline, oil, and coal as fuel is the most important cause. Burning those fuels releases lots of carbon dioxide. Craig Idso, from the Center for the Study of Carbon Dioxide and Global Change, said he doubts that worldwide temperatures will increase much more than they have already. According to Idso, an increase in carbon dioxide may be a good thing, since plants need carbon dioxide to grow. By taking in more of the gas, plants ""will grow like gangbusters,"" he said. The effects of global warming will vary from place to place, scientists say. In the United States, global warming could cause warmer weather in Alaska, more forest fires in California, crop failures in the Midwest, and longer growing seasons in the Northeast. In the meantime, many companies are working to reduce the amount of carbon dioxide pumped into the atmosphere. For example, automobile manufacturers are developing new fuels that could replace gasoline and limit carbon dioxide emissions. Michael Glantz, from the National Center for Atmospheric Research, said that people will learn how to live with global warming. ""Society is more robust than we give it credit for,"" he said. ""People may learn to live more comfortably in a new, warmer world."""	4
"In 1916, Jeanette Rankin became the first woman elected to Congress. Today, 61 women serve in the 435-member House, and 13 of the 100 members of the Senate are women. (Five are in the photo.)

She recently said, ""I intend to work as hard as I can and to represent the people of New York to the best of my ability."""	4
"Lakshmi is a 10-year-old girl who lives in India, a country in Asia. Each morning, she gets up and leaves her home by 7 o'clock. But she doesn't go to school; she goes to work. Beldine Nakaisa is a 9-year-old girl who lives in Kenya, a country in Africa. Each day, she wakes up at 5 a.m. to make breakfast for the family she works for and lives with. She then spends the rest of the day doing dishes, cleaning the family's house, and caring for the family's children. Beldine and Lakshmi are among the 250 million kids worldwide who have to work, according to the United Nations. Those kids work in people's houses, on farms, or in factories. They make all kinds of products, including carpets, shoes, soccer balls, clothing, bricks, and bidis (BEE-dees), a kind of cigarette. Lakshmi's parents borrowed 300 rupees, or about $17, from a man who owns a bidi factory. Lakshmi will work in the bidi factory until her family pays off the loan. But 300 rupees is more money than her parents will ever have. Her brother explained, ""We don't have 300 rupees. We will never have 300 rupees."" Beldine's family gave her to another family so they wouldn't have to feed her. Beldine's family is very poor. They cannot feed all their children. According to the United Nations, many of the kids who are forced to work live in Africa, southern parts of Asia, and South America and the Caribbean. About 61 percent of all child workers live in Asia, 32 percent in Africa, and 7 percent in South America and the Caribbean. (See map.) Many world leaders are trying to stop child labor. In 1998, the president of South Africa said his country would try to ""prevent a new generation of children from becoming victims [of child labor]."" The president of Brazil said he would ""use all [Brazil's] resources to remove children from work."" And last year, U.S. President Bill Clinton signed a treaty banning child labor worldwide. Lee Muthoga, who works to stop child labor, said many poor countries should make new laws to end child labor. ""Lawmakers, the police, religious leaders, and adults have to come together to protect the rights of children,"" he said."	4
"Though most fourth graders learn about government in their classroom, Dana Terrace recently had the chance to see it firsthand. The 10-year-old from St. Rita's School in Hamden, Connecticut, recently traveled to Washington, D.C., as a Weekly Reader kid reporter. In Washington, Dana spent a day with U.S. Senator Christopher Dodd of Connecticut. Dodd, a Democrat, was first elected to the Senate in 1980. Dana met the senator at 8:30 a.m. at the National Archives, where many of the country's most famous documents are kept. The senator showed Dana several of those documents, including the Constitution and the Emancipation Proclamation. During the next eight hours, Dana learned what a U.S. senator does. ""Senator Dodd is very busy,"" Dana said later. ""But he always had time for a smile and to explain to me what he was doing. I had lots of fun spending the day with him."" Here's what the Weekly Reader reporter learned during her day with Senator Dodd. After visiting the National Archives, Dana and Senator Dodd go to the Russell Office Building, where most senators have their offices. While Dana waits for the senator to return from a meeting, she does some work at the senator's desk. Dana and Senator Dodd walk to a meeting of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. The committee is meeting to consider President George W. Bush's nomination of Richard Armitage as deputy secretary of state. Dana and the senator head to the Senate Chamber in the Capitol. The Capitol is located a short distance from the Russell Office Building. The two take a special subway that connects the office building to the Capitol. Usually, only government officials ride on the subway. Dodd and the other senators are meeting in the Senate Chamber to vote on a bill. It is the first of six votes the senators will cast throughout the day. Dana interviews students from the Greens Farms Academy in Westport, Connecticut. The students have traveled to Washington, D.C., to meet with Senator Dodd. The senator tells the students about some of the important issues facing the United States. After the students leave, it is time for lunch. Dana interviews Senator Dodd. She asks him questions about what a senator does and how he thinks education could be improved.

"Billy the Kid is one of the best-known outlaws in U.S. history. He is infamous for shootouts, in which he killed several lawmen. Now, 120 years after Billy's death, a lawmaker wants to pardon, or clear from blame, the Kid. New Mexico Rep. Ben Rios wants Gov. Gary Johnson to pardon Billy the Kid, who used several names, including William H. Bonney, Henry McCarty, and Henry Bonney. In 1878, Billy the Kid shot and killed Sheriff William Brady. In April 1881, the Kid was sentenced to hang for shooting Brady. Before the sentence could be carried out, however, Billy escaped from jail, killing two deputies. After Billy escaped, Sheriff Pat Garrett tracked him down and shot him to death in July 1881. The descendants of Sheriff Brady say that pardoning the Kid would be another crime. Bennett Brady, the sheriff's great-grandson, said, ""He doesn't deserve pardoning."" Governor Johnson agrees. Diane Kinderwater, a spokesperson for the governor, told Weekly Reader that Johnson would not pardon the Kid. Kinderwater said the governor had told her, ""No, Billy the Kid is a murderer. He killed three law enforcement officers."""	4
Many people think that the new millennium began on January 1, 2000. But they're wrong. The new millennium actually begins January 1, 2001. That's because the calendar we use doesn't have a year zero. Our present calendar actually began with the year 1. A year may be only 365 days, but a lot can happen in such a short time. Below are just a few of the many important events that took place this past year. It was a tough summer for many people in the western United States. Wildfires burned about 7 million acres of land--six times the size of the Grand Canyon National Park. The fires forced thousands of people to leave their homes. Many people returned home and found charred rubble. Recovery is already under way in most burned areas. In Utah, officials from one park are using a helicopter to spread grass seeds over wide areas. The United States was the top medal winner at the 2000 Olympic Summer Games in Sydney, Australia. The United States took home a total of 97 medals, 39 of which were gold. There were some spectacular events in this year's Summer Games. One of the highlights was the victory of U.S. wrestler Rulon Gardner (left) over Russian Alexander Karelin. Gardner beat Karelin, who had not lost a match in 13 years, by 1 point. The International Space Station (ISS) received its first long-term guests in November. The station, which is being built with help from 16 nations, was first put in orbit in 1998. According to NASA (the U.S. space agency), the station should be completed by 2006 and will weigh more than 1 million pounds. Scientists will stay in the ISS to conduct long-term experiments that cannot be done on Earth. Terrorism struck Americans on October 12 when a bomb ripped a huge hole in the side of the Navy destroyer USS Cole. The ship was docked in Aden. Yemen, a country in the Middle East. U.S. officials said that the attack occurred when two men in a rubber boat exploded a bomb next to one side of the Cole. The blast killed 17 sailors and injured dozens of others. Another ship carried the Cole to the United States, where it will be rebuilt. More than 97 million people voted for president of the United States on Tuesday, November 7. Most political experts had predicted that the race would be close, but no one knew that it would be as close as it turned out to be. On the day after the election, Vice President Al Gore had slightly more votes than Texas Governor George W. Bush had. But the vote in Florida was so close that the state had to recount all 6 million votes cast in that state. The race was so close that no one knew who had actually won the election long after the polls closed.	4
One of the world's biggest oil rigs sank into the Atlantic Ocean last month. The rig, called P-36, sank in the waters about 75 miles off the coast of Brazil, South America, after a series of explosions damaged a pillar supporting it. The explosions killed ten workers and injured others. Workers struggled for days to save the rig, only to see it slowly topple over and sink into the ocean. Officials from the Brazilian oil company Petrobras, which owns the rig, were concerned after some of the 400,000 gallons of diesel fuel and crude oil on the rig leaked out. But the spill turned out to be smaller than expected. The problem now facing Brazil is the loss of oil production. The P-36 rig provided a large portion of the oil Brazil uses to make fuel. Now the country will have to import more oil from other countries to meet demands.	4
"Could you keep quiet for one day? How about for a month or a year? That's what Brett Banfe is doing. The 18-year-old believes that silence is golden, and he has promised not to utter a single sound for an entire year. Brett is remaining silent to raise money for charity. He came up with the idea when he was talking to several friends. ""We were talking about what it would be like to stop speaking for a day,"" he explained. ""And I said I could do it for a year."""	4
"""May I stay up just a little longer?"" That's the cry heard from kids every night in many U.S. households. That's because most kids don't want to go to bed. Instead of sleeping, many kids are watching latenight TV, playing computer games, reading, doing homework, or chatting with friends. According to a recent report, staying up late may be costing kids more than just a few winks. The National Sleep Foundation (NSF) recently studied the sleeping patterns of 12- to 18-year olds. The NSF study says only 15 percent of kids get at least 8½ hours of sleep per night. The NSF says kids need 9 to 11 hours of sleep each night. Jennifer McCandless, age 13, said she tries to go to bed on time each night. Jennifer explained what happens if she doesn't get enough sleep. ""I'm like a zombie-- awake, but not doing anything,"" she said. Will Wilkoff is a children's doctor and sleep expert in Maine. He said one reason kids aren't getting enough sleep is that families are busier than ever before. Families are trying ""to squeeze 28 hours of living into 24 [hours],"" Wilkoff said. In the past, most kids would go home right after school. Today, kids often have several after-school activities. When kids do get home, they have homework to do. All of this activity keeps kids from going to bed when they should. Kids who don't get enough sleep can have problems at school. The study found that kids who don't get enough sleep at night often fall asleep during the day. Sixty percent of the kids in the study said they have felt tired during the day. Twenty percent said they have even fallen asleep at school. Kids who are tired have problems remembering information. The study found that kids who don't get at least nine hours of sleep at night get lower grades than kids who get enough sleep. Wilkoff said that kids have to develop a schedule that lets them get enough sleep. ""Make those tough decisions,"" he said, ""and say, 'We're going to have to give up one or two of our activities.' "" If a kid loses one hour of sleep a night, how many hours of sleep does he or she lose in a week? A month? A year?"	4
"On September 11, terror gripped the people of the United States. Millions of citizens across the country watched in horror as terrorists used hijacked airplanes to attack two of America's most famous landmarks--the World Trade Center and the Pentagon. Another stolen plane crashed in Pennsylvania. The destruction caused by the hijacked jetliners stunned eyewitnesses. ""It was like the building had been hit by an asteroid,"" Marty Singer said of the World Trade Center in New York City. Another eyewitness compared the attack on the twin towers of the World Trade Center to a terrible storm. ""Giant balls of flame burst out of the walls,"" Hugh Smyser said. ""Glass and aluminum sheathing [outer material from the buildings] came down like a huge snowstorm."" Although the attacks took place in New York and our nation's capital, every U.S. citizen felt the impact of the attacks. Many states and communities closed public buildings, parks, and monuments. Events, such as baseball games, were canceled. Many businesses and schools were closed, as everyone mourned the victims of the savage attacks. The flames from the burning landmarks forged a new bond among Americans. Thousands lined up to donate blood for victims injured in the attacks. Firefighters, rescue workers, doctors, nurses, and volunteers worked tirelessly. Millions of Americans sent canned goods, snack foods, bottled water, and money to help the victims and rescue workers. As Americans came together to help one another out during the crisis, people throughout the world knew that life would never again be the same. ""This is one of the few days in life that one can actually say will change everything,"" said one European leader. U.S. authorities said soon after the attacks that the terrorists who hijacked the four planes from three airports must have planned their assaults carefully. Here's what happened, beginning at 8:48 a.m. on September 11. A plane hijacked from an airport in Boston, Massachusetts, crashes into one of the 110 story towers that made up the World Trade Center in New York City. As the building burns, a second plane hijacked from Boston slams into the other World Trade Center tower 18 minutes later. A third hijacked jet, which took off from an airport near Washington, D.C., crashes into the side Pentagon in Arlington, Virginia, across the Potomac River from the capital. The Pentagon houses the offices of most of the branches of the U.S. military. One of the World Trade Center towers collapses. Fifteen minutes later, a fourth hijacked place crashes in Somerset County, Pennsylvania, about 80 miles southeast of Pittsburgh. The other tower collapses almost 25 minutes later. Rescue workers comb through the rubble of the World Trade Center and the Pentagon looking for survivors. At the same time, law enforcement officials look for clues to find the terrorist who staged the brutal attacks."	4
"On September 11, the foundations of some of America's most famous landmarks were reduced to rubble by terrorist attacks. But the foundations of the United States are not as fragile as those buildings. To prove that point, millions of Americans have come together to help one another. President George W. Bush recently recognized the heroic efforts Americans have made in the wake of this tragedy. In a speech on September 18, Bush said: ""Out of our tears and sadness, we saw the best of America. We saw a great country rise up to help. Tens of millions of dollars and thousands of hours and tons of food and clothing have all been donated to help rebuild shattered lives."" By flying flags and holding vigils, millions of Americans shared the president's sentiments. ""As Americans, there is a bond between us, no matter how far away we are from one another,"" said Karen Bogart of Pasadena, California. In the aftermath of the attacks, thousands of heroes offered to help. Those heroes were the volunteers, firefighters, police officers, and emergency crews at the World Trade Center and the Pentagon. Many of those heroes traveled thousands of miles to help out at ""ground zero,"" the site of the World Trade Center collapse, in New York City. ""We've had fire departments from Chicago, Philadelphia, Los Angeles, Sacramento, and so many other places help us,"" said New York City Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani. In addition to their usual jobs, rescue workers looked for pets trapped in deserted apartments or injured in the attacks. Many people who live near the World Trade Center in New York City had to leave their apartments quickly and were not allowed to return--even for their pets. ""Sometimes the owners feel so guilty that they abandoned their pets,"" said Jennifer Olsen of the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals. ""But it is so gratifying to see them when they reunite with their pets after all this time."" The rescued animals included cats, dogs, birds, and even a gecko, a kind of lizard. To get to the gecko, named Little Dude, rescue workers had to climb stairs to the 39th floor of a building. Despite that obstacle, Little Dude was reunited with its owner. Whether rescue workers cleared rubble, looked for and helped survivors, or retrieved lost pets, their heroic efforts made all Americans proud to be Americans. Recently, President Bush also spoke of national pride. ""As president of this great land, nothing made me more proud."""	4
"Throughout the world, people expressed outrage at the attack. ""It's just sick,"" said one firefighter. An airplane expert said, ""This is perhaps the [worst] terrorist attack that's ever happened in the world."" Like adults, kids were very upset by the attacks. Many of them first learned about the brutal attacks at school. In many schools, students and teachers comforted one another. Teacher Diane Bulens said the principal at her school in California told the teachers to watch out for the students and then ""told the kids to take care of the teachers."" One student was worried about her father, who was in New York. Taylor offered to let the student use her cell phone to learn whether her father was OK. He was! Even though teachers and students looked after one another, many were still fearful that something more would happen. Erin Ricketts, age 11, feared that her state would be attacked. ""I heard California may be next,"" she said. She added that she was worried ""because my mom works in a big building."" After school, many students went home to talk with their parents about the attacks. Doctors say that in this tragic time, kids, parents, and teachers need to talk to one another. By coming together, Americans will grow and become stronger than ever."	4
"If you listen to music, you are probably like millions of other kids--you turn up the volume when you hear your favorite song. Listening to loud music may be fun, but a government study shows it may also be dangerous. According to the study, which was paid for by the U.S. government, more than 5 million kids, ages 6 to 19, have suffered some hearing loss. That's more than one out of every ten kids. Out of the kids with hearing loss, more than 250,000 have moderate to severe hearing loss. Amanda Niskar, of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta, Georgia, conducted the study. She was surprised by the results. ""It was assumed in the past that children wouldn't have noise-induced hearing loss at an early stage,"" Niskar said. Niskar blames the hearing problems on loud noises. Loud noises are a ""problem for children,"" she said. Loud music, fireworks, emergency sirens, and construction noise can all cause hearing problems. Hearing loss affects kids for the rest of their lives. In addition, not being able to hear well can cause kids all kinds of other problems. For example, hearing loss ""can influence [a] child's ability to learn in the classroom,"" Niskar said. If a child cannot hear the teacher or classmates well, he or she might have a hard time understanding lessons and following instructions. Niskar said the best way to prevent hearing loss is either to stay away from loud noises or to wear hearing protection, such as earplugs and protective headphones. So the next time you want to pump up the volume, turn it down instead."	4
"Toy companies are always looking for the latest toy craze. One toy maker thinks it has a jump on the competition. It has just come out with a high tech pogo stick called the Airgo. Unlike other pogo sticks, the Airgo doesn't have squeaky springs that help kids jump up and down. Instead, it has an air pump that will give users some extra lift. According to an official at Razor USA, which makes the toy, the newly designed pogo stick is ""really cool looking"". It has adjustable handlebars and folds down to 22 inches."	4
Emi is a nervous mother-to-be. She should be, because there is a lot of pressure riding on her. Emi is a Sumatran rhinoceros. She lives at the Cincinnati Zoo in Ohio and has been pregnant since June 2000. When she delivers her calf this fall, it will be the first Sumatran rhino born in a zoo since 1889! The Sumatran rhino is a very rare animal. According to the International Rhino Foundation, only about 300 Sumatran rhinos live in the wild. The rhinos' numbers have dropped because they are hunted and because their habitat, or land where rhinos live, is shrinking. Indonesia and Malaysia, two countries in Southeast Asia, are home to most of the remaining Sumatran rhinos. Zoos, governments, and scientists around the world are helping to protect rhinos. Breeding rhinos in zoos is one way of helping. Organizations such as the foundation are also working to protect the rhino's habitat. In addition, Rhino Protection Units have been formed to protect rhinos from poachers. Poachers are people who break the law by hunting animals that are off-limits.	4
"Recently, Williams recalled an accident that happened during his first year teaching. His students were playing dodgeball. Suddenly, the ball slammed into one girl's face, smashing her nose. The girl had to be taken to the hospital. Soon after that, Williams started a campaign to ban dodgeball from schools. Some schools in several states have already banned the game. The object of dodgeball is to get other players out by hitting them with a ball. Critics of the game say that it teaches violence. ""The game allows the stronger kids to pick on and target the weaker kids,"" Williams told Weekly Reader. Judith Young is the executive director of the National Association for Sport and Physical Education. She told Weekly Reader the game doesn't belong in school. ""I don't have a problem with the game at backyard picnics and parties,"" she said. ""I just don't think it should be used in phys-ed classes."" Rick Hanetho strongly disagrees. He likes dodgeball so much that he started the National Amateur Dodgeball Association. Hanetho says dodgeball teaches kids important skills. ""It teaches eye-hand coordination, decision making, concentration, and agility,"" he said. Hanetho also says that dodgeball does not encourage bullying. ""I don't buy the idea that dodgeball allows some kids to pick on the smaller and weaker kids,"" he said. ""In fact, it's the littler kids who are usually the best players. They are faster and can avoid being hit."" Mara: age 10: Some kids don't like dodgeball because they get hit at the beginning of the game. But I like it."	4
"Police officer Ray Petersen was walking his beat on the streets of Vancouver, Canada. Suddenly, a frantic mother ran to him for help. Petersen soon discovered that he had waded into some ""fowl"" play. You see, the mother was a duck. Her family of ducklings had fallen into a sewer drain, and she wanted Petersen to rescue them. The mother duck grabbed Petersen's leg. Then she waddled to the sewer drain and sat down. Petersen followed her. ""I went to where the duck was lying and saw eight babies in the water below,"" he said."	4
"The paragraph below is an early version of the fist two paragraphs from the story On Top of the World. The paragraph contains many errors. Read the paragraph and find the errors. As a class, discuss why each is an error. For climber Erik Weihenmayer, one of the hardest part of climbing Mont Everest, the tallest mountain in the world was leeping under crevasses. A crevasse is a deep crack in a glacier, a huge sheet of moving ice? ""I never got used to those 4- or 5- foot Crevasses that are hundreds of feet deep,"" said Wehenmayer. Yoou had to jump across them? You have to be very careful when you land."""	4
"Mount Etna blew its top last summer. The volcano blasted molten lava nearly 1 mile into the sky. When Mount Etna began erupting, vulcanologists, scientists who study volcanoes, rushed to the mountain. Mount Etna is on Sicily, an island that is a part of Italy. The scientists went to Sicily to learn from the 3,000-year old volcano. One of the things they wanted to learn is how to predict when a volcano will erupt. Dozens of vulcanologists bravely climbed Mount Etna each day. They hoped that the mountain of fire would be a good teacher. ""We will probably learn more about this volcano during this eruption than had been learned in 3,000 years"", said Borris Behnke, a German scientist. Climbing Mount Etna is more dangerous than climbing some other volcanoes. The scientists risked being burned by the rivers of lava flowing down the volcano. Hot lava flowed from both the top of the volcano and from many vents, or holes, along the volcano's sides. Etna was also hurling huge rocks into the air. ""Some of them are bigger than cars and some might be as big as trucks,"" said Behnke. Some of the scientists didn't need to climb Mount Etna. Over the past few years, scientists had placed hundreds of sensors on the volcano. The sensors gather data about the lava flow and send the data by radio to scientists located a safe distance from the volcano. The sensors also record earthquakes. Earthquakes in a volcanic area can mean that the volcano is about to erupt. In the days before Mount Etna erupted, the sensors had picked up more than 2,600 small earthquakes. Behnke says that lava may erupt from Mount Etna for at least six more months. During that time, he plans to climb the volcano many times, risking his life to learn firsthand what is happening."	4
"Firefighters usually use water and chemicals to fight wildfires. But this summer, firefighter battling a wildfire near Jackson, Wyoming, fought the fire with a new weapon a chemical used in disposable diapers. The firefighter sprayed homes that were in the fire's path with a special gel nicknamed ""green slime"". The slime, which doesn't burn, is made from the same absorbent chemicals that are used in disposable diapers. The firefighter sprayed the gel on nearly 200 houses. Because the green slime doesn't burn, it protects the houses from the fire."	4
Saying you're sorry or apologizing when you hurt someone is always the right thing to do. In fact, scientists say that even some fish apologize when they accidentally hurt other fish. Cleaner fish are fish that clean tiny plants and animals off other fish. Every so often, a cleaner fish accidentally nibbles on the fish it is cleaning. According to scientist Redouan Bshary and Manuela Wuerth, to apologize for biting the fish, the cleaner fish rubs the other fish's fins.	4
The Wright brothers flew the first gasoline airplane about 100 years ago. Now the National Aeronautics and Space Administration is developing a plane powered by sunlight. The plane, called Helios, has a 250-foot-long wing. That's about the length of seven school buses put end-to-end! On top of the wing is a layer of solar cells. Solar cells are special devices that change sunlight into electricity. Helios will fly about 100,000 feet above the ground--higher than most planes and clouds. Because it is powered by sunlight, Helios will be able to stay in the air for months, even years, at a time.	4
Curious George isn't as young as he used to be. The spry monkey is celebrating his 60th birthday. During the last 60 years, Curious George's adventures have helped teach millions of kids to read. Kids and their parents have bought more than 20 million Curious George books. The books have even been translated into 12 languages. Now George is off on a new adventure. He's going to Hollywood to make an animated movie. What kinds of trouble do you think George will get into in Hollywood? Stay tuned to find out.	4
Hawaii is famous for its fiery volcanoes and rivers of lava. According to legend, those volcanoes were created by the goddess Pele, who made the fiery mountains by driving her digging stick into the ground. Such legends are important to native Hawaiians. Today, however, ancient gods are a part of a fiery debate in this land of spirits. Currently, scientists use 13 telescopes in a special 11,000-acre area called the Science Reserve on Mauna Kea. Using those telescopes, scientists have made several important astronomical discoveries. The scientists who use the telescopes pay a fee to the University of Hawaii, which built the observatories. The use of the mountain for scientific research, however, is the source of a debate between scientists and some native Hawaiians. Some Hawaiians believe that the top of Mauna Kea is sacred, or an important place to their religion. They believe that the peak is the home of the snow goddess Poli'ahu. University officials say that a master plan, completed in June, addresses native Hawaiian concerns. The goals of the plan include educating people about Mauna Kea. It also states how many telescopes the university can build in the future. According to observers, the debate will not end soon. A 1968 agreement gives the university control of the area until 2033. Until then, native Hawaiians will fight for what is theirs while scientists keep studying the skies. For many years, Hawaii was a monarchy, which is a type of government led by a king or queen. In 1778, Hawaii had its first contact with Europeans when English Captain James Cook landed on the islands. He named them the Sandwich Islands. Cook was later killed by Hawaiian warriors when he returned to the islands. Over the next 100 years, more foreigners, including Americans, arrived on the islands. A struggle for power ended in 1893 when American plantation owners helped overthrow Queen Liliuokalani. By 1900, Hawaii had officially become a U.S. territory. A territory is land that belongs to a nation but is not officially a state. Hawaii became a U.S. state in 1959.	4
On March 22, Kelsey Penfield, age 9, was working at her desk at Maplehurst Elementary Schook in Norwalk, Ohio. She was also chewing her pen cap. Suddenly, she swallowed the cap. The pen cap became lodged in Kelsey's throat, and she began choking on it. She tried coughing up the cap, but the cap wouldn't move. Unable to breathe, Kelsey began pointing at her throat. Kelsey's classmate Elizabeth Muirhead, age 9, realized that Kelsey was choking. Elizabeth immediately sprang into action and performed the Heimlich maneuver on her classmate, saving her life. Elizabeth had learned the Heimlich maneuver in an issue of Weekly Reader. Recently, Weekly Reader caught up with the two girls to ask them about that fateful day. Elizabeth We were in class doing our grammar work. That's when Kelsey started choking. There was a boy between us, but he didn't know what was going on. Kelsey was pointing to her neck. I asked her if she was choking, and she nodded. That's when I ran over to her and did the Heimlich maneuver. WR What were your thoughts? Were you scared? EM: I was really scared. The first time I tried the Heimlich, I didn't do it that hard. I was afraid of hurting Kelsey. The second time, I squeezed a little harder. Then the third time, the pen cap just flew out. All the time I was thinking that Kelsey is my best friend and I'm not going to let her die. EM: We read about it in an issue of Weekly Reader. Mrs. Moore put us in groups of two, and we practiced doing it. Kelsey: I was really scared. I was chewing on a pen cap, and all of a sudden it slid down my throat. I couldn't breathe. I'm not going to chew on pen caps anymore. You shouldn't really chew on anything. You never know when you can accidentally choke. 1. Stand behind the choking victim and wrap your arms around his or her waist. 2. Make a fist and hold it against the victim's stomach, about halfway between the belly button and the rib cage. 3. Grab your fist with your other hand. Press it in with an upward thrust. Repeat until victim stops choking.	4
On TV, Homer Simpson has done many amazing things. The cartoon character has flown into space, met U.S. Presidents, and toured with several rock bands. In real life, he has done something even more amazing. He has coined a word that has been added to the Oxford English Dictionary. The 40-volume Oxford English Dictionary contains all the words in the English language. Doh, which Homer Simpson says when he makes a mistake, and nearly 250 other words were recently added to the dictionary.	4
Many Americans are flying and hanging the flag today. U.S. law and custom tell us how the flag should be displayed. For example, a flag should never touch the ground andcshould not be flown at night unless it is illuminated. Here are some other rules governing how the flag should be displayed. The flag can be displayed vertically or horizontally. The union, or blue corner, should be displayed to the upper left of an observer. The flag should be placed to the right of the speaker. Other flags should be placed to the left. The flag should be flown at half-staff only during periods of official morning. The flag should be raised to the top of its pole and then lowered to half-staff. At the end of the day, when the flag is lowered, it should be raised to the top before it is lowered.	4
"Hua Mei isn't your typical California girl. Sure, she likes to eat, sleep, sit in her pool, and play. On hot days, she really likes to sit in her air-conditioned room. After all, Hua Mei is covered with black-and-white fur and weighs 150 pounds! Hua Mei is a giant panda who celebrated her second birthday last week. Born on August 21, 1999, at the San Diego Zoo in California, Hua Mei is the only giant panda born in the United States to live more than four days. When she was born, Hua Mei looked like a pink rat the size of a cell phone. She weighed only 4 ounces. For two weeks after Hua Mei was born, her mother, Bai Yun, held on to her without ever letting go. Bai Yun was careful because she didn't want to crush Hua Mei. At the time, Bai Yun weighed 200 pounds! Since Hua Mei's birth, millions of people have seen her. Thousands of people flock to her den each day. ""She's so cute,"" Rebecca Ralston, age 11, said after seeing the panda. ""She's like a big teddy bear."" The giant panda is one of the rarest animals. As few as 1,000 pandas survive in the wild. Giant pandas live only in the bamboo forests of China, which are being destroyed. Loggers have cut down vast areas of those forests. The trees are used for firewood and to make buildings. Farmers use the cleared forests to grow crops. To protect the giant panda, China has set up 33 reserves, or special protected areas. It is illegal to cut down trees and brush or hunt in the reserves. The reserves are helping to increase the number of pandas living in the wild. Panda scientists at the San Diego Zoo say they want to help increase the number of pandas living in the wild. ""Someday, we may be able to raise pandas in captivity and release them to the wild,"" panda scientist Don Lyndberg told Weekly Reader. For now, pandas remain on the edge of extinction."	4
"About 5,000 years ago, a man died on a snowy mountainside in Europe. For years, scientists have wondered whether he died from disease or the cold. Now they know that the ""Iceman"", as he became known, died after being shot with an arrow. In 1991, two mountain climbers found the Iceman in the Alps, a mountain chain in Europe. Scientists took the well-preserved, frozen body to a museum in Italy, where they have been studying it. ""This changes everything. Now research on the Iceman starts over,"" said scientist Alex Susanna. Susanna is the director of the museum where the Iceman's frozen remains are kept and studied."	4
On her TV show, Judge Judy Sheindlin makes difficult decisions concerning the cases she hears. Now the judge has written a book that aims to help kids make tough decisions. In her latest book, You Can't Judge a Book by Its Cover, the judge presents situations that kids might find themselves in at school. She then offers some solutions but lets kids make their own decisions. Recently, Weekly Reader talked with Judge Judy. Here is what she had to say about her TV show and her book. Judge Judy: I developed them from real-life situations. I'm a grandmother. I asked my grandkids about the situations. I also tried to relate to kids and let them know that what they do now will affect them in their adult lives. This advice will, I hope, help them make the right choices. JJ: Today, we live in a society that has both parents working. Working parents don't always spend enough time with their kids. Kids need parents who talk to them. JJ: You should always think about what the right thing to do is--not what feels good, not what your friends are doing. If you think about what the right thing to do is, then eventually the right thing happens, and you sleep better at night. WR: Your dog is pictured on the cover of your book. What's its name?	4
"Keiko was free to go. According to scientists, the famous killer whale was swimming with wild killer whales in the waters off Iceland during the summer. Iceland is an island nation in the northern Atlantic Ocean. Keiko became famous after starring in the movie Free Willy. After the movie, thousands of people donated money to have Keiko moved from his tank in Mexico to the protected bay in Iceland. The problem, said the scientists who work with Keiko, was that he wouldn't stay with the other killer whales, or orcas. Every time Keiko's handlers took him out into the ocean for a ""walk,"" he returned to his pen. ""Keiko won't go, he won't leave us,"" said Jean-Michel Cousteau. Cousteau is the president of the Ocean Futures Society. The group oversees Keiko's care."	4
"As kids have reached out to help others, they've learned about what their country stands for. English teacher Nan Bartow of New Haven, Connecticut, has been teaching for more than 30 years. She said, ""Kids are more patriotic than ever before."" Patriotism is love for one's country. Many other teachers agree with Bartow. ""The students are saying, 'We are proud to be Americans' and that they appreciate everything they have,"" said Cynthia Elwood, a principal in Arlington, Texas. Kids have shown their appreciation by sharing what they have. Here are some of the things they have done: ""It is especially hard for children to understand what has happened, but they know how to show love,"" said Sue Hale, who helped coordinate the donations. Many kids wrote and attached special notes to the bears they donated. They said the bears and notes would help give thousands of kids hope for a bright future. If you are looking to help the victims and families of the terrorist attacks in New York City and Washington, D.C. you might contact the following organizations. Each of these organizations has a long history of helping disaster victims. * The United Way has set up the September 11 Fund to help victims and their families. You can learn more about the fund at www.unitedwaynca.org. You may also have local chapters of these charities in your community. If so, you can call them and invite representatives to talk to your class about what they are doing to help."	4
"Griselda Garcia knows something about hard work. The 14-year old from Santa Ana, El Salvador, has had a job for the last four years. She uses the money she earns to help feed her family. ""I go to school in the morning and work in the market for about five hours every afternoon"", said Griselda. Griselda is not alone. Worldwide, many kids have to work. Some of them are worse off than Griselda. The meeting is called the Special Session on Children. It will take place at the United Nations. The United Nations is a place where people discuss world problems. One part of the discussion will be about a report created by the United Nations called "" A World Fit For Children"". In the report, the U.N. asks government to adopt rules to protect children. Here are some of the rules: Nelson Mandela, the former president of South Africa, plans to attend the session. He said, ""We cannot waste our precious children, not another one, not another day. It is long past time for us to act on their behalf"". As for Griselda, she told U.N. officials recently that she hopes ""all governments will value the rights of children. My ideal world is a just and fair place for children, where our rights are respected and where we can participate in everything""."	4
"A ""cat-tastrophe"" recently struck the airport near Providence, Rhode Island. Airport officials were forced to cancel a flight when they found a runaway cat named Muffy sitting in the airplane's wheel well, the place where the landing gear is stored during flight. The wayward cat had been placed in a cage to be put aboard an airplane. But somehow Muffy escaped and climbed into the wheel well of a nearby plane. Airport workers spent hours trying to coax the cat down from its hiding place. They even offered Muffy some tasty treats. Finally, after seven hours, the workers removed panels from the plane's wing and pulled Muffy to safety. Muffy, the runway runaway, was then reunited with her family."	4
"One of the regions the Spanish explored first was the Southeast. Hernando de Soto and 600 followers were the first European explorers to journey through the Southeast. For nearly four years, de Soto and his followers wandered through the region. After sailing from Cuba in 1539, de Soto landed in Florida. An earlier Spanish explorer, Juan Ponce de León, had named the land La Florida, after a Spanish word meaning ""flowery"". La Florida was much larger then present-day Florida. It covered most of the area in what are now the southeastern states. One of de Soto's men described the animals the explorers found. ""There are many lions and bears in Florida, wolves, deer, jackals, cats and rabbits (also live there),"" he wrote. Many different groups of Native Americans lived in La Florida. They grew corn, beans and squash. They also fished and hunted. Because the native groups did not trust de Soto, they often left their villages before the Spaniards arrived. The Native Americans had good reason to fear de Soto. He captured and enslaved some of them. De Soto and his men were mainly looking for gold. The search for gold led them out of present-day Florida north to what is now Georgia, South Carolina and North Carolina. After reaching North Carolina without finding gold, the explorers turned west and crossed the Appalachian Mountains. Upon hearing rumors of gold, de Soto led his men into Tennessee and south to Alabama. In southern Alabama, the Choctaw Indians attacked the explorers. They killed many of de Soto's men, and some of his supplies were taken. De Soto's expedition then turned northwest through Alabama and into present-day Mississippi. In May 1541, de Soto reached the Mississippi River, near what is now Memphis, Tennessee. Then they crossed into Arkansas, where in May 1542, De Soto died. The explorers then retreated to the Mississippi River, where they built boats, which sailed down the river to the Gulf of Mexico. Only about half of the people who had landed with de Soto in Florida survived the trek across the Southeast."	4
On September 11, 2001, many Americans lost mothers, fathers, sisters, brothers, and friends in a national tragedy. Those who knew them are feeling a great loss, and you may be feeling sorrow, fear, and confusion as well. The feelings and thoughts that surround this tragedy are as plentiful as they are conflicting. I want to reassure you that there are many people including your family, your teachers, and your school counselors, who are there to listen to you. September 11 changed our world. But with each story of sorrow and pain comes one of hope and courage. As we move forward, all of us have an opportunity to become better people and to learn valuable lessons about heroism, love, and compassion. As we mourn those who died, let us remember that as Americans, we can be proud and confident that we live in a country that symbolizes freedom and opportunity to millions throughout the world. Our nation is strong, and our people resilient. We have a well-earned reputation for pulling together in the worst of times to help each other.	4
Have you ever heard someone speak Eyak, Navajo, or Udihe? You probably have not, but they are among the 6,800 languages spoken worldwide. The three languages are among many that may soon die out. According to officials at the Worldwatch Institute, half of the world's languages are spoken by fewer than 2,500 people. Those languages may die out by the end of this century. About 100 people in Russia speak Udihe. Six people in South America speak ArikapÃº, and only one person, Marie Smith of Alaska, speaks Eyak. As people move from their homelands, they learn new languages and often forget their native languages. As increasing numbers of people move, their languages die out. Manx, a language from the Isle of Man in the Irish Sea, died out in 1974. Ubykh, an ancient language from Europe, disappeared when the last man who spoke it died in 1992.	4
"The officials want to stop boaters from speeding in areas where manatees, or sea cows, live. Manatees are endangered mammals that live in water. Speedboats often collide with the slow-moving sea cows. Officials hope the new speed traps will slow down boaters. Last year, boats injured or killed 78 manatees. During the first six months of this year, 48 manatees were injured or killed by boats. State and wildlife officials blame the increase in manatee injuries and deaths on the number of boaters. ""There are more boats [on the water] now, so that's causing more [manatee] deaths,"" said Nancy Sadusky, an official of the Save the Manatee Club."	4
"At first, the bird becomes confused and clumsy, and it has trouble flying and walking. Eventually, the disease kills the bird. In recent years, the mysterious disease has infected a number of bald eagles. A fisherman found the first infected bird in DeGray Lake in Arkansas in 1994. By the end of that winter, 29 bald eagles throughout the country had died. So far, the disease has killed more than 80 eagles, including at least 16 this year. Although the number of birds dying from the disease each year is small, the deaths worry wildlife experts. Two hundred years ago, about 500,000 eagles lived in 45 U.S. states. As the number of people living in the United States increased, the number of bald eagles decreased. By the 1960s, only a few hundred bald eagles lived in the wild. Hunting and pollution had killed many of the birds. Then lawmakers passed special laws to protect bald eagles. The laws worked. Today, about 5,800 pairs of eagles live in the wild. Wildlife experts are especially concerned because they don't know much about the disease, including what causes it. ""We have some ideas, but we don't have any answers,"" John Fischer, of the University of Georgia, said. The most likely cause may be a natural chemical or some kind of pollution, Fischer said. Experts also don't know when the disease started. It might have been around for years before it was discovered. ""This disease could have been around for much longer [than since 1994] and it just wasn't noticed,"" Fischer said. While wildlife experts are trying to learn more about the disease, it is spreading. It has infected coots, ducks, geese, and great horned owls, in Arkansas, Georgia, South Carolina, and North Carolina. Scientists are now scrambling to learn more about the disease. They want to find a cure before it kills more birds, including America's bird--the bald eagle. The bald eagle has been the official symbol of the United States since June 20, 1782. Though people today agree that the bald eagle is a powerful symbol of the United States, that wasn't true in 1782. Benjamin Franklin did not think the eagle was a good symbol to represent the United States. He though the turkey was a better symbol. ""I wish that the bald eagle had not been chosen as the representative of our country"", Franklin wrote. ""He is a bird of bad moral character...the turkey is in comparison a much more respectable bird""."	4
"If you have had a cavity, you have probably felt the bite of a dentist's whirling drill as it cuts into your tooth. Soon, however, the dentist may no longer need a drill. Tooth decay is a disease. So dentists at Harvard University decided to fight the disease that causes cavities. ""We decided to try to beat the disease, rather than just drill and fill [cavities],"" said dentist Daniel Smith. The dentists have invented a vaccine, or a medicine, that could prevent cavities. The vaccine attacks the bacteria, or germs, that live on teeth. The germs make an acid that causes cavities. The vaccine is a new way to prevent tooth decay. Brushing after meals and cutting back on sweets are two other weapons used to fight cavities. Fluoride, a chemical that strengthens teeth, also fights cavities. Fluoride is added to water and toothpaste. But many countries can't afford to put fluoride in water, and fluoride doesn't kill cavity-causing bacteria. ""[Tooth decay] is an epidemic worldwide,"" Smith said. ""Even if you have fluoride, you still have the bug [that causes tooth decay]."" So far, the scientists have tested the vaccine on rats. The rats that took the vaccine didn't get many cavities. Now the scientists want people to try the vaccine. If it works, dentists may have a lot less drilling to do--other than drilling it into people's heads to remember to take the vaccine!"	4
"It was a clear evening on July 23 as James Mennig stood outside his home in Pottsville, Pennsylvania. As he looked up into the sky, Mennig saw something that caused him to turn and run inside. Mennig saw a bright object streak through the sky. ""It looked like a plane that was totally engulfed in flames,"" he said. The flaming object Mennig saw was not a burning plane. It was a meteor burning up in Earth's atmosphere. A meteor is a piece of rock or metal from space that burns up as it streaks through Earth's atmosphere. Because meteors look like stars falling or streaking across the sky, many people call them shooting stars. Scientists said the meteor exploded somewhere near Williamsport, Pa. No one was hurt by the fireball and no homes were damaged. But eyewitnesses later described a layer of gray ash and damaged plants in a cornfield. According to scientists, meteors streak through Earth's atmosphere every day, but most burn up before hitting the ground. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration is now studying ways to prevent large meteors from hitting Earth. Observers not only saw the fireball, they heard it as well. As the fireball raced through the atmosphere, it produced a loud noise. ""There were two monstrous booms followed by a long rumbling and this great shaking. It knocked pictures off walls,"" said Anna Jean Edkin, a safety official in Anthony Township, Pa. Meteor? Meteorite? Meteoroid? What's the difference? *Meteors come from pieces of space debris called meteoroids. Meteoroids can be made of rock, metal, or both."	4
"This summer, when 'N Sync took the stage at Giants Stadium in New Jersey, Morgan Oseiki was there. The 9-year-old told Weekly Reader that the group did more than ""Bring in' Da Noise."" The members of the band talked about the dangers of illegal drugs. Justin Timberlake, Chris Kirkpatrick, Lance Bass, JC Chasez, and Joey Fatone have joined forces with the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy. The drug policy office designs programs to help kids stay away from drugs. Because 'N Sync is one of the best bands today, the White House office asked the group to bring its anti-drug message to kids. ""We think having ['N Sync] as part of our team is really going to raise the volume on our message to kids,"" said Edward H. Jurith, who is head of the White House office. Together, the White House office and 'N Sync are promoting the National Youth Anti-Drug Campaign. As part of their summer tour, the boys talked about their ""anti-drugs,"" the things they do instead of drugs. The group also invited kids to send their anti-drugs to the Office of National Drug Control Policy. Grace Chen, 11, of Glen Dale, Maryland, said it's music. She plays the violin."	4
"For climber Erik Weihenmayer, one of the hardest parts of climbing Mount Everest, the tallest mountain in the world, was leaping over crevasses. A crevasse is a deep crack in a glacier, a huge sheet of moving ice. ""I never got used to these 4- or 5-foot crevasses that are hundreds of feet deep,"" said Weihenmayer. ""You had to jump across them. You have to be very careful when you land."" For most climbers, jumping over a crevasse is hard enough. But for Weihenmayer, jumping over the cracks was particularly hard because he is blind. Last spring, Erik Weihenmayer became the first blind climber to reach the peak of Mount Everest. He was part of a team of climbers that was sponsored by the National Federation of the Blind. Mount Everest is 29,035 feet tall and sits on the border between Nepal and China, two countries in Asia. According to many climbers, Mount Everest is one of the hardest and deadliest mountains in the world to climb because of the mountain's height. ""There are a lot of things that can happen up there. You're not ever really sure that you're going to make it,"" Weihenmayer told Weekly Reader. Climbers can suffer from illnesses caused by many things, including the altitude. Altitude sickness occurs when a climber does not get enough oxygen. The team took more than two months to complete the climb. Weihenmayer spent much of his time moving the team's supplies up the mountain to a base camp, which was located at 17,600 feet. The time spent moving gear helped Erik Weihenmayer get used to the altitude. ""You're letting your body get used to the elevation, the air, the temperature,"" Weihenmayer said. Weihenmayer, who had already climbed several of the world's highest peaks, had help getting up Mount Everest. ""[People] would walk ahead of me with a bell,"" he said. ""I tried to stay in their footsteps. I tried to stay [close] behind them so I could hear their steps, and I stepped into those places."" For Weihenmayer, climbing Mount Everest was the toughest but most rewarding experience of his life. When he got to the top, Weihenmayer stopped to think about what he had done. ""I thought about the ground underneath me. I felt these cool flags [at the peak] that were up there in the breeze,"" Weihenmayer said. ""I thought about my family, friends, and about where I was."""	4
Calling all kids! Weekly Reader wants you to take part in its sixth annual Backpack Survey. Since 1996, Weekly Reader has been finding out from kids how much weight they carry in their backpacks. Last year, the average weight was 7.9 pounds. Some of the kids who wrote to us said their packs weighed 20, 25, or even 30 pounds! According to medical experts, kids can hurt their backs by carrying too much weight in their backpacks. The problem is so serious that California may spend $200,000 to study how much weight kids have in their packs. Doctors say that a kid's pack should not weigh more than 10 percent of his or her total weight. For example, a kid who weighs 60 pounds should have a pack that weighs no more than 6 pounds.	4
"""A penny for your thoughts"" is something many people say to one another. Soon, however, the old saying may have to be changed to ""a nickel for your thoughts."" Saying that a penny has ""virtually no value,"" Rep. Jim Kolbe of Arizona wants stores to stop using the penny. He has introduced a bill in Congress that would require stores to round prices to the nearest nickel. Kolbe says that most people don't usually use their pennies. He says people just toss the coins aside. Critics, however, disagree with Kolbe. They argue that if Kolbe's bill becomes law, people will pay more for many of the things they buy. The critics claim stores will round most of their prices up, not down. The penny is the oldest currency authorized by the U.S. government. The government first minted the 1 cent coin in 1787. Since then, the U.S. Treasury Department has made more than 300 billion pennies."	4
"Daizsana Turnage knows that she should not play in the street. But the 8-year-old recently joined hundreds of kids to play tennis with Monica Seles on one of the busiest streets in New Haven, Connecticut. Today, Seles is one of the world's best tennis players, and she plays on the best courts. But as a young girl in Europe, Seles often played in parking lots. She remembers her father tying a string to two cars to make a tennis net. ""I think it's great for kids to see that you don't have to have the perfect equipment [to play tennis],"" Seles said. ""If you love the game and you have the dedication, you can make it."" Many of the kids who played with Seles said the tennis star inspired them to play better. ""It was a lot of fun,"" said Daizsana. ""I've played tennis with my aunt and my grandmother,... but this was really great. I just hope I get better."""	4
According to reports, many U.S. cities are going to the rats. The number of rat sightings is up in the past year. For instance, in Boston, rat complaints are up by 40 percent. In Chicago, rat sightings are up almost 50 percent. Rats have always lived in cities. The rodents live off food and waste that people throw away. Recently, however, rat populations have grown because many communities don't have the money to pay for rat-control programs, said Jerry Hershovitz of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Such programs keep rat populations down. The solution to the rat problem is to limit their food supply, say experts. For example, people in cities should use garbage cans that rats cannot get into.	4
The Red Spider Nebula surrounds one of the hottest stars in the Milky Way Galaxy. Earth is located in the Milky Way. The star has a surface temperature of at least 900,000 degrees Fahrenheit (F). In comparison, our sun has a surface temperature of only 10,000 degrees F. The Red Spider Nebula formed when the star began to run out of fuel and exploded, pushing gases in its atmosphere away from the star. The remaining star collapsed to form a white dwarf star. White dwarfs are very small and very hot. The tremendous heat from the star warms the nebula, causing it to glow red. The gases in the nebula reach temperatures of 18,000 degrees F.	4
Saturn is known for its rings. But scientists now say the planet has another claim to fame. It has more moons than any other planet in our solar system. Astronomers, scientists who study space, have been studying the space near Saturn. They recently discovered a dozen moons that had never been seen before, increasing the number of known moons orbiting Saturn to 30. The newly discovered moons range in size from 4 to 19 miles across. At one time, the tiny moons were probably large rocks traveling through space. When they passed by Saturn, the planet's gravity pulled them in and captured them. The rocks have been orbiting the planet ever since. Over time, the large moons broke apart to form the smaller moons. Some astronomers wonder whether Saturn will hold on to its title as the moon king. Jupiter has 28 known moons. Some astronomers think they will find more undiscovered moons orbiting Jupiter, making Jupiter the moon king. Titan is Saturn's largest moon. A thick, murky atmosphere surrounds it.	4
"Some pet owners look like their pets. Now owners can also smell like their pets. A company has invented a perfume for cats that their owners can also wear. The perfume is called Oh My Cat. ""It is to promote harmony between you and your pet,"" said Nick Munafo, who works for the company that makes the perfume. ""On weekends, I put it on my cats, and they really seem to like it,"" he said. He added that he also wears a little of the perfume."	4
"Steve Cantees is a high school principal. He always worries about his students' grades and behavior. This year, he is also concerned about their school clothes. His worries don't stop at school, however. Cantees is also concerned about the clothes his daughters are wearing to school. ""My wife is even having problems shopping [for clothes] for our daughters in the third and fourth grades,"" said Cantees. Parents also worry about school clothes. Some of the clothing looks like garb worn by pop stars Madonna, Britney Spears, and Christina Aguilera. The clothes include miniskirts, stretch T-shirts, and hipster jeans. For years, stores have sold clothing to teens similar to the styles pop singers wear. Now the stores are selling those clothes to 8- to 12-year-olds. Roberta Capole, the editor of Tiger magazine, says many kids just want to look like pop stars. ""I don't think it's about trying to look older,"" she said. ""I think kids are just trying to dress like stars they think are fantastic."" Store officials and clothing designers hope to make lots of money selling the new fashions. Stores say that each U.S. kid spent about $500 on school clothes this fall. Some store clerks don't understand what the fuss is about. They think the new fashions are OK. ""We make sure all our clothes are age appropriate,"" said one clerk. She went on to describe the hipster pants she sells. ""They are an inch below the waist."" Clothing designers say they have to make the new fashions. ""If I don't make it, someone else will,"" one designer said. Parents are upset about the new fashions. ""When I take [my kids] shopping, they pick out things that... aren't appropriate for school,"" said one mother. Teacher Dana Zeman says the new fashions don't belong in school. ""In my class, I'd like to set [a dress code],"" she said."	4

"Admiral Richard Byrd was one of the first people to explore Antarctica. Beginning in 1928, the U.S. explorer led several expeditions across the frozen continent. Sometime between 1939 and 1941, Byrd or one of his group buried a Hershey chocolate bar in the ice near the South Pole. The candy bar remained buried for 60 years. Then, in January 2001, explorer Douglas Stoup found the candy bar buried in 2.5 feet of ice. Stoup donated it to the Hershey Museum in Hershey, Pennsylvania. After 60 years, the candy bar, which weighs about 4 ounces, probably doesn't taste very good. In fact, it was never meant to. The U.S. Army had asked Hershey to make special candy bars, called Field Ration Bars, as a test. The bars were made to give soldiers lots of energy and not melt easily. The Army told Hershey the bars should taste ""just a little better than a boiled potato,"" so that soldiers wouldn't eat too many of them."	4
"Like many 7-year-olds, Demetrio Hernandez Jr. loves to play baseball. But unlike most kids, Demetrio plays without a glove. In fact, Demetrio plays baseball with his feet. Demetrio is a player in the Miracle League in Conyers, Georgia. The league gives physically and mentally challenged kids a chance to play ball. Although Demetrio was born without arms, he has two small hands attached to his shoulders. Demetrio uses his hands to swing a short bat, and he uses his feet to field balls. Gary Garner started the Miracle League in 1998 so his daughter, Lindsay, could play ball. Lindsay has muscular dystrophy, a disease that causes the muscles to weaken. ""Thousands of kids in every community don't get the [chance] to play,"" said Garner. ""What we would love to happen is for our children to be accepted."" Today, there are Miracle League teams in more than 30 states. More teams are forming around the country."	4
"Residents of Pawtucket, Rhode Island, thought a 7-foot Mr. Potato Head would be a perfect gift for Belper, their sister city in Great Britain. Hasbro, a game company in Pawtucket, invented the famous spud in 1952. But the residents of Belper were outraged at the gift. When the giant potato arrived, the locals called it a ""monstrosity."" Some residents complained to the local newspaper about the giant spud. ""We started getting letters saying, 'Why has this horrible thing appeared--stuck in the middle of town? We don't want it here,'"" said Wayne Bontoft of the Belper News. Because of the complaints, Mr. Potato Head was moved to a nearby amusement park. Bob Billington, a Pawtucket tourism official, said the snub ""upset a few folks out here. This is where the little guy was invented. We thought it was a nice gesture."""	4
"On April 14, 1865, President Abraham Lincoln was watching a play at Ford's Theatre in Washington, D.C. As the president watched, John Wilkes Booth pointed a gun at the back of Lincoln's head and fired a shot. The dying president slumped forward, grasping an American flag. For most of the last century, the flag that President Lincoln had touched was missing. This summer, officials at the Connecticut Historical Society said that they had discovered the flag in the society's basement. How did a flag from one of the darkest days in American history wind up in the historical society's basement? After the shooting, the flag that Lincoln had grasped was given to a Civil War veteran from Connecticut. He gave it to his son, who gave it to the historical society in 1922. The flag ended up in the basement, where it lay, forgotten, for 76 years. In 1998, a society librarian was in the basement. ""I looked down and saw what looked like a flag in a box,"" the librarian said. Now visitors can see the flag at the society's museum. ""The flag makes history real,"" Susan Schoelwer, of the historical society, told Weekly Reader."" The American flag has changed many times. Here are some of the changes:"	4

This time, a 20-year-old Anakin Skywalker, played by Hayden Christensen, is learning to be a Jedi under Obi-Wan Kenobi, again played by Ewan McGregor."	4
Most people want their wedding to be a special day. David Leibowitz and Kimberly Miller chose to start their marriage with a voyage to the bottom of the sea. As part of a contest, Leibowitz won a submarine trip to see the Titanic. The Titanic was a passenger ship that sank on April 15, 1912, after hitting an iceberg in the North Atlantic Ocean. On their wedding day, the couple boarded a small sub and traveled to the ocean floor. The sub stopped on the bow of the Titanic. Standing inside the sub, the couple were married. Critics are not happy about the wedding. They say that the ship is a monument to a horrific event. It sank on its first voyage, killing 1,500 people.	4
"But some Americans acted differently. Instead of helping others, they attacked innocent Arab and Muslim Americans. Some individuals vandalized mosques (the buildings where Muslims practice Islam, their religion). Others attacked anyone they thought looked to be from the Middle East. ""What took place, no sound mind would approve of it, and no religion at all in the world would accept it,"" Khoui said. ""Islam does not approve of what took place."" President George W. Bush agreed with the Islamic leaders. While visiting a mosque, President Bush commented on the attacks on Muslim and Arab Americans. ""That's not the America I know,"" he said. ""That should not and that will not stand in America."" Muslims practice the religion of Islam. Islam was first preached by the prophet Muhammad about 1,400 years ago. In the 600s, Muhammad had a dream in which Allah, the Arabic name for God, called him to be a prophet. Islam means ""submission, commitment, and peace"". Islam teaches that human diversity, or difference, is a sign of the richness of Allah's mercy. In other words, according to religious experts, Islam promotes peace. Those experts add that the September 11 attacks do not represent Muslim beliefs. The majority of the 1.2 billion Muslims worldwide practice peace and tolerance toward others."	4
"You've probably sat at a desk or on a bench on which someone had carved or scratched a message. Etching, or carving, messages is nothing new, however. People have been carving and painting messages on rock walls for thousands of years. Scientists recently announced that they had discovered ancient etchings in a cave in France, a country in Europe. The etchings are between 22,000 and 28,000 years old. The cave etchings show prehistoric people and animals. Drawings of bison, horses, mammoths, and rhinos dot the cave walls and ceiling. Marc Delluc discovered the cave etchings. Delluc is a cook who spends many of his weekends exploring caves in France. One day, he was exploring a tunnel in one cave when he noticed the etchings. He was the first person in thousands of years to see the amazing carvings. Delluc said the etchings are beautiful to look at. ""I just sat there gazing at the ceiling,"" he said."	4
"The paragraph below is from the story ""Mystery Disease Attacks America's Bird."" Circle all the verbs in the story. The bald eagle is perhaps the most majestic bird in the United States. It can rise high into the air, soar faster than 40 miles per hour, and dive at 100 miles per hour. The bald eagle's grace in flight is one reason the giant bird was made a symbol of the United States. However, a mysterious disease is now killing some bald eagles."	4
Weekly Reader editor Beth Rogers made three new friends in July--Naku, Kela, and Inuk. Her friends are about 14 feet long and weigh more than 1,000 pounds each! They are beluga whales that live at the Mystic Aquarium in Connecticut. Beth met her new friends through a new program at the aquarium. The program gives visitors a chance to wade into the water with the whales and touch them. Visitors wear thick rubber overalls to stay warm in the cold water. They can stroke the whales and touch the animals' tongues. According to their trainers, the belugas love to have their tongues rubbed. Beluga whales eat about 50 pounds of fish each day. They make noises such as clicks, squeaks, whistles, and moos. Belugas use their sounds to send messages to one another and to help them find their prey.	4

"Fourth grader David Casey likes to surf the Internet. He finds information that helps him do his homework. He listens to music and plays games on the Web. He even talks with friends in chat rooms-at least he used to. After David started getting e-mail from strangers, his parents limited what he could do on the Web. His parents wanted to protect David. Now the federal government is trying to protect David and other kids. ""Kids need a safe place to go on the Internet.

"Imagine having time for a game of chess in between your math and social studies lessons. It's not as surprising as you would think. Chess is catching on in elementary schools across the country. Students at Sky Oaks Elementary School in Burnsville, Minnesota, learn chess as part of the curriculum. ""It's fun to play,"" said Alex Powell, a fourth-grade student at Sky Oaks. Chess is a game of skill between two players. It likely began during the 7th century in India. The object of the game is to checkmate, or trap, the other person's king.

"The U.S. flag sails at half-staff at Kennedy Space Center in Cape Canaveral, Florida, where Columbia was scheduled to touch down. A Navy cadet salutes as flags are lowered to half-staff during a memorial service in Kentucky. On February 1, 2003, a terrible tragedy left Americans stunned and mournful. High over Texas, under the backdrop of a clear, blue sky, the space shuttle Columbia broke into pieces. The tragedy occurred only 16 minutes before Columbia was scheduled to land at Cape Canaveral, Florida. It happened 39 miles above the Earth at the end of a 16-day journey. Aboard the shuttle were six Americans and one Israeli astronaut. All seven astronauts were killed. The force of the explosion was so strong that it scattered remains of the shuttle across hundreds of square miles in Texas and Louisiana. ""The Columbia is lost,"" President Bush told the nation. The loss of Columbia reminded Americans of another space shuttle tragedy. On January 28, 1986, the space shuttle Challenger exploded during liftoff. When Columbia reentered Earth's atmosphere, it was exposed to extreme temperatures. To protect against the extreme heat, thousands of heat-resistant tiles covered the space shuttle. Investigators immediately focused on whether damage to the tiles on the left wing contributed to Columbia's accident. Columbia was NASA's oldest shuttle until its 28th mission ended in tragedy. Until this year, there had never been an accident during descent or landing-for 42 years of U.S. human spaceflight. With this tragedy, Americans have been reminded of the risks and the glory of space travel. The nation came together with an outpouring of sympathy for the loss of Columbia's crew. Flags were flown at half-staff. People in Texas and Florida created memorials. Despite the shuttle's loss, President Bush has said the United States will persist in its exploration of space. ""Our journey into space will go on,"" said Bush."	4
"Assur was once one of the greatest cities in the world. About 30,000 people lived there. A huge temple tower, or ziggurat, stood about 200 feet above the city streets. Assur (or Ashur) was one of the leading cities of Assyria, the center of a great empire. Today, ancient Assur is in ruins. Desert sand has covered over much of the 3,500-year-old city. Now Assur faces a new threat: water. Assur is located in what is now Iraq, a country in the Middle East. Many parts of Iraq are covered by desert. Water is hard to find in the desert areas. To increase the amount of water, Iraqi officials are building a dam on the river Tigris. The dam will trap the river's water. As the water rises, it might flood Assur and many other nearby ancient ruins. Scientists worry that floodwaters will destroy artifacts hidden beneath the desert sand. Assur has already been the site of some amazing discoveries. Scientists recently discovered four hidden tombs at Assur. They found ancient coffins, gold, jewelry, and gems. They also dug up the remains of two ancient Assurian queens. Scientists used modern medical equipment to study the queens' bodies. They learned about some of the medical problems the ancient queens suffered from. The bodies showed evidence of dental cavities, sinus infections, and poor nutrition. Müller-Karpe and other scientists worry that the new dam may keep them from getting more answers. Even if the new dam doesn't flood Assur, the rising water could damage the ancient city. Moisture could cause the artifacts to crumble. ""You can't save Assur if it's [near] a dam,"" said scientist Peter Miglus. The soil beneath the ancient city would soak up water like a sponge. The water in the soil would destroy what's left of ancient Assur. For now, scientists are scrambling to uncover the secrets hidden for centuries in Assur and other nearby communities. Meanwhile, some people are looking for ways to save the ancient cities. ""We don't want the slightest damage to Assur,"" one Iraqi official said."	4
"If two heads are better than one, a newly discovered turtle is head and shoulders above other turtles. May Toro found a two-headed turtle in Florida. ""I was shocked. I couldn't believe it,"" Toro said after she picked up the turtle. Toro works for Mary Kraus, who studies turtles. Kraus says she has seen the eggs of two headed turtles before. However, she has never seen a living two-headed turtle. ""This is the first time I've ever seen one alive, fully developed, and hatched,"" Kraus said. The two-headed turtle is a loggerhead turtle. The U.S. government says the loggerhead turtle is an endangered species. Loggerhead turtles can grow to be 3 feet long and weigh up to 350 pounds! After studying the turtle for a couple of days, Toto and Kraus let the turtle go. ""We didn't want it to become a freak in a freak show"", Kraus said."	4
"Benjamin Franklin once said, ""A penny saved is a penny earned."" For the people of Boston and Philadelphia, Franklin's pennies have come to mean a lot. When Franklin died in 1790, he left money to both cities. Franklin chose those two cities because he was born in Boston and lived most of his life in Philadelphia. Franklin left the money to help people who need it. ""I wish to be useful even after my death,"" Franklin wrote. He knew that his money would grow in value over time if it was invested right. Before he died, Franklin made sure that the money would not be wasted. He left specific instructions on how the money should be used. For the first 100 years, the money was used for loans to young people who wanted to learn technical skills. After the first 100 years, the money was used for education and public works. After 200 years, most of the money was given to the state governments that support each city. Today, the money Franklin left in his will is worth millions of dollars. It has helped pay for education, equipment for fire departments, and the building of a museum."	4
"Recently, soldiers from North Korea and South Korea marched into a no man's land. The area is between the two countries. The soldiers cleared land mines from the area. In the future, roads and railroads might be built there. The roads would link the two countries for the first time in almost 50 years. The no man's land was set up after fighting in the Korean War ended in 1953. It is a demilitarized zone (DMZ). The DMZ is not under anyone's military control. ""Today we are standing at the start of a new era during which the South and the North will move forward hand in hand toward the future,"" said a South Korean official as the search for land mines started. ""We are burying a history marked by the scars of war and the pain of division."" After World War II ended in 1945, Korea was divided into two countries-North Korea and South Korea. On June 25, 1950, North Korea invaded South Korea. Sixteen countries including the United States sent soldiers to help South Korea. All 16 countries were members of the United Nations. China and the Soviet Union helped the North Koreans. About 2 million died in the war. Many of the casualties were civilians. More than 107,230 U.S. soldiers were killed. Most of the fighting ended when an armistice, or agreement to stop fighting, was signed on July 27, 1953. Land mines were placed in the DMZ to keep the two sides from combat. However, the two sides never signed a peace treaty. The two sides continued to fight occasionally. Now the countries are trying to settle their differences and work together."	4
"How did the universe begin? Most scientists think that it happened with a giant cosmic explosion. That idea is known as the Big Bang theory. A theory is a way scientists explain how or why something happens. In the past, scientists estimated that the universe was between 13 and 15 billion years old. Now, thanks to satellite technology, they are able to confirm its approximate age at 13.7 billion years old-give or take 100 million years. Using satellite technology, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) created a detailed picture of what the universe would have looked like shortly after the Big Bang. The snapshot provides answers to questions about the age and origins of the universe. ""We see the results as a gold mine for learning about our universe,"" said NASA scientist Charles Bennett. ""The patterns in the picture tell us all kinds of things about the universe."" The space agency says the findings provide evidence that stars began shining about 200 million years after the Big Bang. This was half a billion years earlier than scientists had originally predicted."	4
"A mysterious box has many scientists talking. The box is 20 inches long and almost 2,000 years old. At one time, it held the bones of a man named James. Some wonder whether James was related to Jesus of Nazareth. Christianity is based on the teachings of Jesus. Christianity is one of the world's largest religions. The box may be the oldest known artifact to mention Jesus. The box is an ossuary. An ossuary is a bone box. From about the year 20 to the year 70, Jews used bone boxes to hold the bones from dead bodies. Carved into the side of the bone box is Aramaic writing. The writing identifies whose bones were placed in the box. In English, the carving says, ""James, son of Joseph, brother of Jesus."" As soon as historians learned what the writing on the box meant, they wanted to know more. For example, they wanted to know if the Jesus mentioned in the carving was Jesus of Nazareth. The writing on the box poses a problem. James, Joseph, and Jesus were very common names at the time the box was made. Historians had to use math to determine how many people named James had a father named Joseph and a brother named Jesus. They learned that only 20 people could have been the James mentioned in the carving. Of the hundreds of bone boxes that have been found, only two others mention a brother's name. Historians say the Jesus mentioned on the box must have been a very important person. Did the bone box belong to a brother of Jesus? Some historians say Jesus had brothers or half-brothers. Others say Jesus only had cousins. Regardless of whose bones were placed in the box, the discovery is important to historians. ""This is something that provides a bridge over time,"" said one historian. ""My reaction is not so much excitement as it is awe."""	4
"The disease has scientists alarmed. First identified in 1995, sudden oak death has spread along hundreds of miles of California's coastline and jumped into southern Oregon. In addition to attacking oak trees, it has spread to redwoods, Douglas firs, and other types of trees and shrubs. One of the worst outbreaks of the disease has occurred at California's Pfeiffer Big Sur State Park. Scientists recently discovered the organism responsible for the disease. It is a fungus that causes oozing red blobs to grow on diseased oak trees. On younger redwoods, it dries up leaves and kills sprouts. According to scientists, redwoods are hosts for the disease. A host is an organism on or in which another organism lives. The disease first showed up in rhododendron plants in the Netherlands in 1993. Scientists are concerned because the spread of the disease could pose a threat to the redwoods' ecosystem, an environment where plants and animals coexist. Scientist David Rizzo said that anytime you have a strange organism, there is cause for concern. Studies show this disease spreads rapidly during the wet months of spring. The coming months could be vital in tracking the disease. Current weather forecasts predict that this spring will be rainier than the last two springs. ""We have to get familiar with the symptoms and the treatments,"" said another scientist, ""because we don't know how much farther it will spread."""	4
Look at the coins in your pocket. Most likely, the coins have something in common: a U.S. president pictured on one side. Most U.S coins have depicted presidents since 1909. Some coin collectors say U.S. coins should have a greater variety of pictures. For instance, they want to take the image of Abraham Lincoln off the penny. They want to remove the drawing of Thomas Jefferson from the nickel. Weinberg and others say the presidential portraits are boring. Instead of presidents, the critics want to see patriotic scenes. Officials at the U.S. Mint, which makes coins, say they are looking into the possibility of change. The mint could have a new nickel in 2003, a new dime in 2004, a new half dollar in 2005, and a new penny in 2006. U.S. coins have honored presidents for almost a century. In 1909, President Abraham Lincoln became the first president to be pictured on a coin. Later, other presidents were pictured on coins. George Washington's image was added to the quarter in 1932. Thomas Jefferson's picture replaced that of a Native American on the nickel in 1938. Franklin Roosevelt's image appeared on the dime beginning in 1946. John F. Kennedy was pictured on the half dollar beginning in 1964. Not everyone agrees that a change in change is good. Some people want to keep their loose change exactly the way it is. In 1933, President Franklin D. Roosevelt had ordered all but two $20 gold coins destroyed. Those two coins were given to the Smithsonian Institution. Shortly before the rest of the coins were destroyed, ten were stolen. All but one of the stolen coins were later found and destroyed. The missing coin was found in Egypt in 1954. Before U.S. officials could claim it, the coin disappeared again. The coin turned up in London in the 1990s. U.S. officials brought it back to the United States. This year, it went to auction. Should U.S coins be changed? Discuss in class and let us know in the Vote section of www.weeklyreader.com/kids/grade4.	4
"Alhaji Babah Sawane was only 10 years old when a rebel group kidnapped him in his African country of Sierra Leone. Taken from his family, he was forced to learn how to fire a rifle. He fought in an army for the next two and a half years. Peacekeepers from the United Nations (U.N.) helped to free Alhaji. In 2001, he addressed the U.N., asking that organization to help children around the world who are forced to fight in war zones. ""We ask this body on behalf of Sierra Leone to do all they can to bring our sad story to an end,"" he said. ""We want to be able to move about freely in all parts of the country."" Sierra Leone is just one of an estimated 41 countries around the world that use child soldiers. While the most offenses occur in Africa and Asia, the problem also exists in Latin America, Europe, and the Middle East. Most children who become soldiers come from very poor countries. The Coalition to Stop the Use of Child Soldiers estimates that 300,000 children are fighting as soldiers. In some countries, boys and girls as young as 8 years old are being recruited, or called upon, to fight. Protecting children in war and conflict zones has become a top job for the United Nations. And the U.N. has made significant progress. In a report issued in December 2002, the U.N. named 28 governments and armed groups that use children to fight their battles. International law prohibits countries from using children who are younger than 15 years old in combat. However, several U.N. conventions condemn, or do not approve of, having anyone under 18 serve as a soldier. If a country recruits child soldiers, it is violating, or breaking the rule of, international agreements."	4
"Standing on a cliff, a sharpshooter carefully aimed his rifle at a Mexican gray wolf. Bulls-eye! The wolf went down. A short time later, he shot a second wolf. The wolves, however, weren't injured. The sharpshooter had shot special darts at them. The darts contained a drug that put the wolves to sleep. U.S. government officials picked up the sleeping wolves. They planned to move the wolves to an area far away from people. The two wolves are part of a program to bring wolves back to Arizona and New Mexico. Until about 1900, the Mexican gray wolf lived in both states. Some of the wolves ate cattle and attacked people. People hunted the wolves because they thought the animals were dangerous. By 1950, few wolves were left in the area. The U.S. government has brought wolves back to those states. But ranchers in Arizona and New Mexico say wolves are causing problems again. What's the scariest animal? Is it a grizzly bear, a shark, or a wolf? Or is it something else? Believe it or not, deer are more dangerous. Deer may seem harmless, but they can cause a lot of trouble. Deer often wander onto busy roads. When they do, they can cause car accidents. In 2001, deer caused 26,000 car accidents. A year earlier, they caused 83 human fatalities. Ranchers say the wolves that the sharpshooters hit with darts killed 19 calves. The ranchers fear that the wolves might attack people as well. ""I can handle the bears and the mountain lions and the bobcats,"" said one rancher. When you see [those animals], they take off. They're scared of you. These wolves, they're not scared. And that's what scares me."" The ranchers say wolves cannot be reintroduced to their area because too many people live there now. ""You can't turn back the clock,"" one person said."	4
"Dan Shaw and Cuddles are an endless source of fascination for onlookers when they're out in public. That's because Cuddles is a miniature guide horse. Shaw, who is blind, said he felt like Cuddles from a television program. Shaw and his wife contacted the Guide Horse foundation in Kittrell, North Carolina. ""Horses make excellent guides,"" said trainer Janet Burleson. ""It is very common in the wild state for a blind horse to bond to a sighted horse that it uses as it' guide."" Guide horses are usually between 26 and 27 inches tall and weigh between 80 and 100 pounds-about the same size as many guide dogs. However, not just any small horse can be a guide horse, says Burleson. It needs to have the right personality and intelligence level. Like a guide dog, Cuddles has been house trained. She will tap her hoof on the door when she needs to go outside. Unlike guide dog, however, she doesn't sleep in the house. Instead, she sleeps in a small barn. Shaw says that everyone wants to pet Cuddles because the tiny horse is so cute. But people should not pet Cuddles or any other service animal. Petting can distract a guide animal from its job of keeping a blind person safe. Cuddles and Shaw have traveled many places together, including the Empire State Building in New York City. ""Every time I hear the gasps of amazement from an onlooker who has just realized that Cuddles is not a guide dog, I smile Shaw says."	4
"After school, would you rather do your homework or play computer and video games? If you are like many kids, you have to finish your homework before you can play games. In some schools, however, teachers are actually assigning video games as homework! The third graders at Prairie View Elementary School in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, play special computer games for homework. Students spend at least 20 minutes four times a week playing the games. Each game is based on their schoolwork. Laurene Lanich, the principal at Prairie View, says the games help kids learn. Other educators agree. ""The kids love it,"" said Joy Davis, a principal at a school where the games are given as homework. ""If you can get students where they think they're learning and playing, it has hit the magic mark,"" she said. Kids like to play the computer games. ""I like it because it's challenging, and when I mess up I do it over and over again,"" student Adel Ahmed said. Lightspan, a company in San Diego, California, designs the games. More than 4,000 schools in 46 states use them. The games have helped a few schools increase scores on standardized tests. The new games might even improve grades, and kids say the games are fun. According to fourth grader Osley Galvez, playing learning games is better than doing homework the old way. ""With this, you play with the controls. It's fun!"""	4
President Lincoln (center) meets with Maj. Gen. John A. McClernand (right), during Battle of Antietam, (Maryland), October 3, 1862. Allan Pinkerton of the Secret Service is on the left. The U.S. Civil War between the Northern States and Southern States lasted from 1861 to 1865. About 620,000 Americans died in the Civil War. That is more than any other war in U.S. history. The Civil War was triggered by the election in 1860 of President Abraham Lincoln. He wanted to abolish, or end, slavery. The South wanted the right to own slaves. The North wanted to end the practice of slavery. In 1861, the South decided to break away, or secede, from the United States. The Civil War ended when the South surrendered in 1865. More than 4 million slaves were freed.	4
Mount Etna is located on the island of Sicily, which is part of Italy. Rivers of molten rock, or lava, flowed down the sides of the volcano, burning everything in its path. Some of superheated rivers of lava flowed toward towns. In an attempt to stop the advancing lava, airplanes dropped thousands of gallons on water on it. Fearing for their lives, many people fled from their homes. The volcano also shot thick flakes of hot ash into the sky. Much of the ash rained down on nearby towns. Some of it rose high into the atmosphere. Winds blew the ash up to 400 miles from the volcano. People in Sicily have lived with Mount Etna for a long time. The first recorded eruption happened about 3,500 years ago. Since then, Mount Etna has erupted more than 250 times. In 1669, an earthquake triggered by an eruption killed nearly 20,000 people. The volcano's last large eruption was in 1992. Scientists used explosives to move the rivers of lava away from towns. Today, people are still learning to live with the volcano. Why is it important for scientists to study volcanoes? Discuss in class and let us know in the Write On section of www.weeklyreader.com/kids/grade4.	4
"Elementary school kids across the nation burn a lot of hours playing video games, surfing the Internet, and watching TV. Some schools have reduced recess and gym time. Those add up to one big problem: Kids are not getting enough exercise. Parents, teachers, and health experts are concerned. According to a new report issued by the American Heart Association, 8.8 million kids and teens weigh too much. The report shows that 15 percent of 6- to 11-year-olds are overweight. This is more than double from 20 years ago. ""Although children may not realize it now, they are setting themselves up for a lifetime of health problems,"" said one doctor. Experts say that overweight kids are at risk for developing heart problems and diabetes as adults. To help kids develop good health habits, some schools are adding gym classes back into the curriculum. Others are adapting, or changing, gym routines so they extend beyond traditional team sports. One school district in Waukesha County, Wisconsin, has added climbing walls to 13 of its 17 elementary schools. Others are offering dance, aerobics, and kite flying to help kids get fit. The goal of physical education is to keep kids active for life-inside school and out. Many schools are stressing the importance of fitness at a young age. One gym teacher said that physical education classes combine fitness with fun to encourage children to lead healthful, active lifestyles. Daily exercise offers enormous benefits to children. Research shows that kids who exercise do better in school. They also have improved self-esteem and feel better about themselves in general. Now, that's something to get worked up about!"	4
"Bingham Bryant didn't go to the school library just to study or check out books. He spent a lot of his library time at Old Lyme Center School in Connecticut staring at a dusty painting that hung on the wall. Curious about the painting, Bingham asked his dad, a military antique dealer, to check it out. ""I've grown up in a house with a lot of antiques around,"" said Bingham, who was in fifth grade at the time he discovered the painting. ""I recognized it as something very old and very beautiful."" And he was right. It turns out that the piece, called The Fate of Persephone, was painted in 1878 by Walter Crane, a British artist. It had been on loan to the school for nearly 70 years. Last summer, the painting was shipped to London. There, it sold at an auction for more than a half million dollars. After receiving a commission, or percentage of money, from the sale of the painting, Bingham noted that it was more than his weekly allowance. Now, that's an eye for treasure!"	4
Last October, officials in North Korea admitted to a U.S. official that North Korea is building nuclear weapons. That action violates a 1994 agreement to stop the spread of nuclear arms. Tensions further increased when North Korea's leader, Kim Jong II, opened up nuclear power plants. The power plants had been closed under an agreement that North Korea made with the United States nearly ten years ago. Officials in North Korea say the power plants will only be used to generate electricity. However, people in the United States and countries near North Korea, like South Korea and Japan, are concerned. They think that North Korea will use the plants make nuclear arms. North Korea recently kicked out U.N. weapons inspectors. That only added to the mistrust. North Korea is an extremely poor country. Yet it spends most of its money on its army. It relies on help from other countries to feed its starving people. U.S. official have said they will communicate with North Korea if it abandons its nuclear weapons program. President Bush has said that the world will respect North Korea when it is no loner a nuclear threat. North Korea and South Korea are located on a Peninsula in Eastern Asia. Soldiers from the United States and South Korea routinely divides North Korea and South Korea. After World War II (1939-1945), Korea was split in half. In 1950, the Korean War began when North Korea attacked South Korea, The United States helped defend South Korea.	4
"February 27 was a sad day in the neighborhood. Fred Rogers, the beloved host of the children's television program Mister Rogers' Neighborhood, lost a brief battle with stomach cancer. He died at age 74 at his home in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Fred Rogers touched generations of children. His show became public television's longest-running program. It was produced for more than 30 years-from 1968 to 2001-and continues to air in reruns. On each show, Mr. Rogers welcomes viewers by taking off his jacket and shoes and putting on a cardigan sweater and sneakers. One of his cardigans hangs in the Smithsonian's National Museum of American History, in Washington, D.C. Mr. Rogers didn't consider himself a TV star.

"Imagine ordering an ice cream cone and knowing that it's improving your health. That might be possible in the future. Scientists are experimenting with ways to add extra nutrients to ice cream. Nutrients are the parts of food that the body uses for growth and energy. One type of nutrient that scientists want to add to ice cream is the group of fatty acids called omega-3. They are found in fish such as tuna, salmon, and sardines. Omega-3 fatty acids are good for circulation and help prevent heart disease. The challenge for scientists is developing a final product that tastes more like ice cream and less like fish. ""It's easier to get people to eat what they're used to than to get them to change their eating pattern,"" said food scientist Bob Roberts. Roberts wants to provide people with more types of foods from which they can get their omega-3s. Ice cream may just be one fun way to do that!"	4
"Recently, Judy Leden strapped a pair of wings on her back. Then she ran as fast as she could down a hill. As she ran, the wings slowly lifted Leden off the ground. Soon she was soaring through the sky. The 30-foot-wide wings carried Leden about 35 feet into the air. Her flight lasted for 17 seconds. The story of Leden's flight begins in Italy in the late 1400s. Italy is a country in Europe. At the time, Italy was caught up in the Renaissance. Many great artists lived during the Renaissance. One of the greatest artists of the Renaissance was Leonardo da Vinci. Though da Vinci is best known for his art, he was also an inventor. He drew many machines that wouldn't actually be built for centuries. For example, he drew pictures of an armored car, a helicopter, a hot-air balloon, and a submarine. Between 1490 and 1505, da Vinci made several drawings of a glider. A glider is an aircraft that doesn't have an engine. It glides on air currents. The wings that Leden used were based on da Vinci's glider. 1. A glider based on drawings made by Leonardo da Vinci recently flew. 2. Leonardo da Vinci was an artist during the Renaissance. 3. A glider does not have an engine. Aircraft experts worked to turn da Vinci's drawings into reality. They carefully followed the drawings. ""In its early stages, it looked like a bird's skeleton, and that's how Leonardo's drawings showed it,"" Leden said. When completed, the birdlike glider weighed 110 pounds. No one knew whether the glider would actually fly. Some people worried that if it did fly, the glider might also crash. ""It was the most dangerous flight of my life,"" Leden said after she flew the glider. Leden flew da Vinci's glider a total of 20 times. Each flight was short, but she didn't crash. Later, Leden said the glider flights were ""very, very thrilling. It shouldn't have worked, but it did!"""	4
"The next time you go to a McDonald's restaurant, you might get a homework assignment with your fries. Although getting homework with a burger and fries might leave a bad taste in your mouth, it will be for a good cause library books. Teachers from around the United States have been working at McDonald's restaurants for a day. The teachers are taking part in McDonald's McEducation program. First, the teachers learn how to use the cash registers. Then they take orders from customers. McDonald's donates 20 percent of the sales made by the teachers to schools. The money is used to buy library books. The McEducation program helps schools and gives students a chance to see their teachers outside of school. ""It's really funny because they are teachers, and they don't look like they belong here,"" said one student from New Haven, Connecticut, after seeing his teachers working in a McDonald's restaurant."	4
"Each year, the Great Insect Fair is held in State College, Pennsylvania. Thousands of people attend the fair to look at bugs, touch bugs, and even eat bugs. Dorothy Blair is a nutrition expert. She says the fair teaches visitors that insects are an important source of food for people in some other countries. ""Last year, we ran out of Chocolate Chirpies. We had to make about 6,000 of them this year,"" Blair said. Many of the fair's visitors are kids. Emily Paulson, age 7, played with a millipede at the fair. The large bug crawled up her arm. She said, ""It's sort of like a comb crawling up your arm. It was neat!"""	4
"In October, a colorful object blazed through the sky over several states. Hundreds of people in Colorado, Utah, and Idaho saw the bright light. Many of them called local authorities to report what they saw. The people had seen an unidentified flying object, or UFO. Many people think that UFOs are spacecraft from other planets. Actually, a UFO is anything that you see in the sky and cannot identify. Usually, even the most mysterious UFOs are eventually explained. Experts say the UFO seen in October was most likely a meteor, or space rock streaking through Earth's atmosphere. Other UFO sightings, however, remain a mystery. For years, the U.S government has been studying UFO sightings. Much of the information that the government has gathered on UFOs is top-secret. Now a new group wants the government to tell everyone what it knows about UFOs. The group is called the Coalition for Freedom of Information (CFI). ""It is time for the government to declassify records that are more than 25 years old and to provide scientists with data that will assist in determining the real nature of this phenomenon,"" said John Podesta. Podesta is a former White House official and a CFI member. The members of CFI asked the government to release information about specific UFO sightings. One such sighting happened in December 1965. On that cold night, people in western Pennsylvania saw a bright light streak through the sky. The light looked liked it crashed behind some hills. The mysterious object might have been a rock from space. A space rock that crashes into Earth is called a meteorite. However, several witnesses claimed that soldiers searched the area where the object ""crashed."" They say the soldiers loaded a car-sized object onto a truck, placed a tarp over the object, and drove it away-never to be seen again. The members of CFI claim that the U.S. government has never released information about the sighting and the object. ""We can't come up with a reason why this information is being withheld. The government won't even acknowledge that the incident took place, but we know that it did,"" said one CFI member. For now, the exact nature of some UFOs remains a mystery. CFI members hope that the answer lies in secret government papers. They say they are only searching for the truth and they want everyone to know the truth."	4
"Most students spend their school days sitting at desks learning. Aurelious Woolfolk, however, does a lot more than sit at a desk when he is in school. He scrambles up high ladders, walks down the sides of buildings, and rides in a fire engine. He is learning to be a firefighter at the New Haven Fire Academy. Woolfolk and 28 other students are currently learning what it takes to become a firefighter. Classes at the fire academy, which is in Connecticut, last for about 22 weeks. On most days, the students go to school from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m. However, once a week, school lasts until 10 p.m. For two days each week, the students sit in a classroom to learn science, math, and emergency medicine. They learn the science of fires, how to calculate water pressure, and how to treat medical emergencies. ""Firefighters have to know lots of different things,"" said Pablo Menendez, an instructor at the school. ""We have to treat medical emergencies, know how to handle dangerous chemicals, and rescue people who have fallen from cliffs."" Teamwork is one of the most important lessons students learn at the school. ""Working together saves lives,"" said Capt. William Seward, the director of the academy. ""Students need to learn that they are part of a team."" Fighting fires is not easy. The suits and equipment a firefighter wears weigh about 40 pounds. Firefighters are very busy. In New Haven, they respond to 32,000 emergency calls a year. Each time firefighters go out, they know they might not come back. Across the United States, about 100 firefighters die each year. ""That's why the lessons learned here at the academy are so important,"" said Seward. ""What they learn here can save their lives."" Firefighters know how dangerous their jobs are. Their training helps them overcome their fear of heights and fires. ""When you're up there on the ladder looking down, it's scary,"" said one student. ""To do this job, you've got to wipe out the fear."" Firefighters overcome their fear for one reason. ""I wanted to help other people,"" said Leah Harwin. ""I think it is important to help other people whenever you can."""	4
"Third grader David Bates won the Weekly Reader American Values contest. The U.S. Army and the Pentagon sponsored the contest. Nearly 14,000 kids in grades 3 through 6 entered the contest. The contest asked kids to write an essay that answered this question: Which of seven American values-loyalty, duty, respect, selfless service, honor, integrity, or courage-is the most important in your daily life? Those seven American values are the core values of the U.S. Army. David chose selfless service as the most important value in his life. David wrote that the other six values are part of selfless service. ""It is most important in my everyday life because it incorporates all the other values."" David; his younger brother, Andrew; and his parents traveled from their home in Spanish Fork, Utah, to Washington, D.C., to get his prize. On November 11, they attended the Veterans Day ceremonies at Arlington National Cemetery. The next day, David was made honorary mayor of the Pentagon. He toured the Pentagon, where he met Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Richard Myers."	4
"How many moons circle Earth? Everyone know that Earth has only one moon. But in September, some scientist said they might have discovered a second moon circling, or orbiting, our planet. Scientist discovered a tiny object in a strange orbit around Earth. A space object that orbits another object in space, as the moon does, is called a satellite. The newly discovered satellite completes its orbit once every 50 days. Because of the satellite's strange orbit the scientist first thought that it was a small space rock. As scientist studied the newly discovered object, they learned that it did not come from space. They decided that the ""new moon"" was actually from Earth. Scientist now say the tiny satellite is actually a part of an old Saturn V rocket. The Saturn V was the largest rocket ever built in the United Sates. It was larger than a football field. The Saturn V launched the Apollo astronauts who went to the moon."	4
"Historians believe that colonists from England dug the well nearly 400 years ago. Shortly after the well was completed, it dried up. The colonists then used the well as a dump. The historians have found a piece of old armor in the well. Studying the armor and other ""garbage"" from the well will help us learn about life in early Jamestown. The history of Jamestown begins in England. On December 20, 1606, three ships sailed from England. The ships were bound for Virginia. After the colonists on the ships landed in Virginia, they built a fort. The colonists arrived in North America 14 years before the Pilgrims. Most of the colonists came to Virginia to search for treasure. Most did not know how to grow crops to feed themselves. They became so hungry that they ate dogs, rats, and snakes. Eventually, more people settled in Jamestown. They turned the fort into a town. The colonists began to grow and sell crops. The small fort became the first permanent English settlement in North America. 1. Jamestown is in Virginia. 2. The settlers at Jamestown were often hungry. 3. Historians are studying artifacts from a well to learn about Jamestown."	4
What's under your feet? If you look at the ground, that question is answered easily. But dig a little deeper-about 4,000 miles deeper. That's where you will find Earth's core. No one has ever journeyed to the center of Earth. However, scientists are trying to figure out what's there. For a long time scientists believed that Earth's core is made of solid iron and nickel metals. Now, according to a new theory, or idea, a powerful nuclear reactor is located in Earth's core. Earth may not be the only planet in the solar system that houses a nuclear reactor. Some scientists say nuclear reactions occur at the centers of Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune. All four of those planets give off, or radiate, more energy than they get from the sun. The scientists say a large energy source must lie hidden deep inside those planets. Inside Earth's core, atoms, or tiny particles, of uranium split apart. When the atoms split, they give off lots of heat. Earth has a magnetic field similar to a magnet's. Just like a magnet, Earth has a north pole and a south pole. The north pole has a positive magnetic charge; the south pole has a negative charge. Earth's magnetic field changes over time. Over long periods of time, the magnetic poles move around. Sometimes the magnetic field completely disappears. Herndon says the nuclear reaction at Earth's core causes those changes. He says the nuclear reaction changes. Sometimes it gives off lots of energy. At other times, it gives off less energy. And sometimes it stops for a short time. If there is a nuclear reactor in Earth's core, someday it will stop completely. That would cause volcanoes to stop erupting, Earth's plates to stop moving, and the magnetic field to disappear forever. The magnetic field protects Earth from dangerous rays from the sun. If the field disappears, life on Earth would end. But don't worry about that. The nuclear reaction in the core will not stop for 2 billion years, Herndon says.	4
Doctors are always on guard against germs. They frequently wash their hands. Now, however, doctors are being told not to wash their hands with soap and water. Instead of using soap and water, the doctors use a special gel. The gel kills germs and saves time. Doctors often take more than a minute to wash their hands with soap and water. The gel speeds things up. What's more, constant washing and drying with soap and water dries out hands. The gel causes fewer problems, so doctors who use it are less likely to skip a cleaning. Killing hospital germs is important. About 2 million hospital patients are infected by viruses each year. About 90,000 die from viruses they got in the hospital. If you're not working in a hospital, using soap and water is good enough. All of us need to keep hands clean to keep germs away. Washing hands is important, especially before eating and before leaving a bathroom, where many germs live. It is important to keep your hands clean at school, too!	4
"Learning all the words in the dictionary just got harder. The publishers of the Shorter Oxford English Dictionary (OED) just added 3,500 words to the dictionary. Many language experts consider the huge OED-the parent of the shorter version-to be the best source on the history of the English language. That dictionary is jammed with more than 500,000 words. It has 21,730 pages and weighs more than 137 pounds! The OED has so many pages that it would take one person 120 years to type all of them. The OED contains words from all the countries where people speak English. It has words from Australia, Canada, England, Jamaica, New Zealand, South Africa, the United States, and many other parts of the world. Many of the new words in the Shorter OED come from science fiction. Words and characters from Star Wars and Star Trek have been added. Among the new words are Jedi, Dark Side, the Force, Klingon, and warp drive. New words invented by J. K. Rowling for her Harry Potter books have not been added to the dictionary; those words are too new. ""Generally, a word has to be used five times in five different places, over five years,"" said Claire Turner, a spokesperson for the OED. Six years ago, Mary French decided to help third graders learn new words and how to use those words correctly. She decided to give every third grader in her state, South Carolina, a dictionary. So far, she has given 350,000 dictionaries to kids. ""Third grade is the grade where they begin to learn words on their own,"" said French, who is often called the Dictionary Lady. ""Giving a child a dictionary gives [him or her] an opportunity to learn a new word... without having to interrupt an adult to ask the meaning or how to spell it."" Now, the Dictionary Lady is taking her program to 42 U.S. states. She says she wants to give away 1 million dictionaries by the end of this school year."	4
"Fourth grader Annie Inglese knows how important it is to get the right amount of sleep each night. ""If I don't get enough sleep,"" she says, ""I have trouble getting up in the morning."" Sleep experts say that kids who do not get a good night's sleep on a regular basis put their safety at risk. Delaying bedtime for other activities can lead to accidents, such as falling off a bike or getting hurt on the playground. In addition to preventing injuries, children who get enough sleep on a regular basis tend to get better grades and be in a better mood. ""Sleep is just as important as nutrition and exercise in our overall health,"" says Dr. Carl Hunt, a sleep expert with the National Institutes of Health (NIH). Estimates show about 1 out of every 4 adults does not get enough sleep. Sleep experts think that number may be just as high for kids. According to the NIH, children ages 7 to 11 need at least nine hours of sleep each night. Most kids and families today have busy schedules that can keep them from getting enough sleep. Plus, watching television, chatting on the Internet, and playing video games all compete with valuable sleep time. Going to bed at the same time each night will help you get a good night's sleep. If you have trouble falling asleep, Dr. Hunt advises you to unwind with quiet time. Reading or listening to soothing music can help bring on sleep."	4
"On August 13, after finishing basic training, more than 1,100 men and women marched into West Point, New York. They are now students at the United States Military Academy - part of the ""long gray line"" of students that stretches back 200 years. The long gray line is what all the students who have ever attended West Point are called. The term refers to the color of the uniforms that the cadets, or military students, wear. It also reminds the cadets that they are part of a long tradition, which celebrates its 200th anniversary this year. On March 16, 1802, President Thomas Jefferson founded a school to train military officers and teach engineering. The school was established at West Point, which had been used as a fort. The school's first class of students was smaller than the one that entered this year. In 1802, only two students were enrolled at the school. The youngest was 10 years old! When West Point was founded, the United States was much smaller than it is today. The country extended from the Atlantic Ocean to the Mississippi River. Until 1817, West Point did not have a set course of study. In that year, Sylvanus Thayer was appointed the superintendent of West Point. He developed the school's curriculum and turned West Point into one of the best schools in the United States. George Woodbridge, who graduated from the school in 1826, explained Thayer's accomplishment, saying, ""His object was to make [us] gentlemen and soldiers."" The officers who graduated from West Point helped build and defend the United States. They explored the vast areas west of the Mississippi River. They designed the roads, bridges, dams, railroads, and canals that the United States needed as it grew. They also helped design some of our greatest buildings and monuments. For example, they worked on the Capitol, the Washington Monument, the Lincoln Memorial, and the base of the Statue of Liberty. Many of the school's graduates have gone on to play important roles in U.S. history. They have been famous generals and U.S. presidents. Both President Ulysses S. Grant and President Dwight D. Eisenhower were generals and graduates of West Point. Jefferson Davis, the president of the Confederate States of America during the Civil War, also graduated from West Point. Even though all West Point graduates serve America in different ways, they all share important lessons learned at the academy. For example, they learn about taking responsibility for one's actions. They also share the school's motto. ""Always there echoes and reechoes in my ears [the motto]: Duty. Honor. Country,"" said General Douglas MacArthur, a West Point graduate. George Washington Whistler graduated from West Point in 1819. He spent most of his career building railroads. He also built steam locomotives. While building his first locomotive, Whistler also built the first American train whistle. He placed his whistle on top of the locomotive. He called his locomotive the Whistler. The sound of Whistler's whistle can still be heard on old steam locomotives."	4
"Believe it or not, the day is almost here! After almost three years of waiting, kids will finally be able to get their hands on J.K. Rowling's fifth Harry Potter book. Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix hits bookshelves on June 21-the first day of summer. Harry Potter fans have already made this book a best-seller. Orders have been pouring into stores since the release date was announced. More than 6 million copies of this long-awaited book are being printed in the United States. That is the largest first printing in publishing history! Rowling began writing the Harry Potter series on scraps of paper at a local cafe in Great Britain. She said the idea for the boy wizard popped into her head during a train ride to London. Her first book, Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone, became an instant hit. Nearly 80 million copies of the first four Harry Potter books have been sold in the United States. What new adventures lie ahead for Harry? In the upcoming book, Hogwarts headmaster, Albus Dumbledore, tells the young wizard, ""It is time... for me to tell you what I should have told you five years ago, Harry. Please sit down. I am going to tell you everything."""	4
At the beginning of the movie, Dobby the house elf warns Harry that if he returns to Hogwarts, disaster will follow. Real problems begin when someone starts turning Hogwarts students into stone. Recently, Daniel Radcliffe, the actor who plays Harry Potter, took time out from filming to talk to Weekly Reader. Here's what he had to say. Daniel Radcliffe: Harry changes a lot in the second film. In the first film, Harry learns about hate. In the second film, he learns how to deal with hate and has to explore his own emotions. He learns that he has something in common with Lord Voldemort, and he has to cope with that. Daniel: I learned how to sword fight. But Rupert [another child actor in the movie] learned how to drive a car for the flying-car scene. Unfortunately, I didn't get to learn to drive because I was in the passenger seat. We try to make it look realistic. Daniel: I go to school three hours a day, every day. I have a fantastic teacher. Daniel: They don't treat me any differently. They see me as Dan. I wouldn't want my friends to see me as Harry. Daniel: It really hasn't changed that much. I am often recognized as Harry Potter. But I don't mind that. Daniel: I think I will take it one film at a time. After this film, I will do the third [Harry Potter] film. After that, we will see how it goes. If you could play a role in Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, which role would you play? Why? Daniel: It's hard work. It is a lot of fun, but at the same time it's really a challenge.	4
There's good news for manatees. For some time, manatees have been in danger of dying out. Now some scientists in Florida say the number of manatees has increased and the sea mammals should no longer be considered endangered. Manatees, or sea cows, live in Florida's warm coastal and inland waters. Manatees are grayish brown and weigh between 1,000 and 1,500 pounds. They can grow to be more than 12 feet long. The sea mammals are herbivores, or plant eaters. To get to plants, hungry manatees have sometimes hauled themselves out of water. They eat between 32 and 108 pounds of plants each day. That means they spend most of their time looking for food. Government officials in Florida have passed laws to protect manatees from harm. They have posted speed limits on waterways where manatees live. They have also posted signs that warn boaters when they are in an area where manatees live. The laws seem to be working. The population has increased to about 3,000 manatees. If the laws continue to be enforced, the number of manatees should continue to grow, the scientists say. Despite the increase in the number of manatees, the animals are not completely out of hot water. The scientists say that if manatees are not protected, their numbers could decline in the future. Some say the numbers may decrease by 50 percent during the next 45 years. Is it important to save manatees and other endangered plants and animals?

"When you are at school or hanging with friends, do you wonder what your dog is doing in your house? If so, a new robot might be just what you need. The robot, called Maron-1, is made by a company in Japan. Maron-1 looks like a cartoon copy of R2-D2. It weighs about 11 pounds and stands about 2 feet high. When it goes on sale in Japan next year, the robot will cost about $1,600. The makers of Maron-1 say their robot is better than the other kinds of robots that you can buy at toy stores. ""Our robot is different from pet robots. It's useful,"" said a representative from the company that makes Maron-1. Maron-1 can detect whether someone or something is moving in front of it. If it sees"" something moving, it says, ""An intruder found."" It can also call you on a cell phone to tell you about the intruder. The amazing robot can do many other things as well. It can turn on electronic equipment, such as a TV and a VCR. Maron-1 can move around, but it cannot go up or down stairs."	4
"More than 1,000 years ago, the Maya lived in part of what is now Central America and southern Mexico. They built huge pyramids and large temples. They studied astronomy and developed a calendar. Then for unknown reasons, the Maya disappeared. Until recently, scientists didn't know what happened to the Maya. Now they may have found the answer hidden in an ancient staircase. They found the staircase in Dos Pilas, Guatemala. Dos Pilas was an ancient Maya city. Winds from a hurricane uncovered the staircase. Scientists studied carvings on the steps. The carvings are called hieroglyphs, which are a kind of picture writing. Scientists translated the hieroglyphs. The writing shows that the Maya disappeared after a brutal war. During the long war, the people living in two Maya cities fought one another. The people of Tikal, in Guatemala, battled the people of Calakmul, in Mexico. The rulers of each city wanted to control the entire area. Dos Pilas was located south of both cities. Dos Pilas had been founded by the ruler of Tikal as a military outpost. The brother of Tikal's ruler ran the outpost. At one point in the war, Calakmul took control of Dos Pilas. Calakmul's warriors spared the life of the ruler of Dos Pilas, so he changed sides. He attacked and defeated his brother in Tikal. After Dos Pilas defeated Tikal, the brutal war between Tikal and Calakmul got worse. Eventually Tikal regained its former strength and ""roared back and crushed Calakmul,"" Demarest said. The fighting between the two cities continued for years. The constant warfare weakened both cities. The war also weakened the Maya civilization, which began to crumble. Today, only ruins of ancient buildings remain as evidence that the Maya once ruled the area."	4

"The healthy number of monarchs has many scientists puzzled. ""It's amazing that they recovered so well,"" said butterfly expert Bill Calvert. In January 2002, a severe storm killed millions of monarchs that were spending the winter in Mexico. ""The data this winter indicates that the monarchs are moving back toward their average population size,"" said Lincoln Brower, another butterfly expert. The data collected this winter shows that monarch colonies, or groups, covered about 20 acres of forests in Mexico. That is close to the average number of 24 acres from 1993 to 2001. After last year's unusual winter storm, the colonies covered only about 5 acres. Each fall, millions of monarchs migrate, or move, south from the United States and Canada to their winter homes in the mountains of Mexico. The orange-and- black monarch butterflies return to the United States and Canada in the spring. Butterfly experts and the Mexican government are concerned that illegal logging is destroying the monarchs' habitat, or home. They are worried because one of the top layers of the forest, called thecanopy, acts as an umbrella to protect monarchs. Illegally cutting down trees thins the canopy. Without the canopy, monarchs are exposed to cold, wet weather, which can kill them. Government officials in Mexico are working with environmental groups to stop illegal logging and save the forests."	4

"You're probably familiar with this saying: An apple a day keeps the doctor away. There has been a lot of health advice in the news lately about what is good for your body. Sometimes it becomes difficult to tell what is true and what is considered a myth. A myth is a made-up story that is passed down from generation to generation. Myths often become accepted as the truth. Weekly Reader spoke with a few health experts to find out the truth behind some common beliefs. Fact: Although eating this fruit won't cure an illness, apples are a healthful food choice. ""[Apples] are good for you,"" said nutrition expert Dr. Melvin Heyman. ""They contain nutrients."" Nutrients are vitamins and minerals that your body needs to stay healthy. Apples are also a good source of fiber, which can decrease the risk of heart disease later in life. Fact: Contrary to popular belief, cuts do not need to breathe. ""The open cut or scrape should be covered,"" said skin expert Dr. Amy Harned. According to Dr. Harned, it's important to wash the wound first. Then, apply an antibiotic ointment and cover the cut with a bandage. Leaving a cut uncovered can allow germs to infect it. Fact: Carrots are rich in vitamin A, which helps keep your eyes healthy. According to eye expert Dr. Timothy Wingert, ""Eating carrots will not improve your eyesight. But eating carrots is part of a well-balanced diet. Carrots have nutrients that help your eyes to function properly."" Carrots also make a tasty snack. Fact: There is some truth to this advice. According to Dr. Wingert, sitting too close to the television for long periods of time makes eyes tired and can cause eyestrain. ""Generally, it is more comfortable on your eyes to view the television from at least 5 feet from the screen,"" he says. So, back up from that television or, better yet, turn it off!"	4
"Does the classic tale about a woodworker whose puppet becomes a live boy sound familiar? Do you remember the name of the puppet from that story? If you answered Pinocchio, you are correct. Many kids are unaware that the original Pinocchio story was not written in America. Pinocchio's roots can be traced back to Tuscany, an area of Italy. Carlo Collodi wrote the original story in Italy in 1881. Since then the book has been translated into more than 250 languages. The story has evolved, or changed, many times since Collodi's original version. Now the puppet-turned-boy is about to embark on a new journey in the movie The New Adventures of Pinocchio. The plot of the movie has an interesting twist. Pinocchio is turned back from a boy into a puppet! The movie appears on HBO Family in February and comes out on video and DVD in April. Playing the part of Pinocchio is 16-year-old Gabriel Thomson, who lives in England. Gabriel starred in the movie when he was 12 years old. Gabriel described his experience as ""incredible."" During filming, he attended school for three hours each day and worked with different tutors. Just as Pinocchio learns lessons about growing up, Gabriel learned some of his own lessons. ""I learned a lot about acting from Martin Landau, [the actor who plays Geppetto]. He taught me how to relax on the set."""	4
For years, scientists have known about a huge hole in a layer of Earth's atmosphere. It's called the ozone hole. It is located above Antarctica. This year, the hole did something surprising. It split in two! Earth's atmosphere is made of several layers. Ozone is a gas that makes up one of those layers. That layer stretches from 6 miles to 30 miles above Earth's surface. Ozone is an important gas. It protects life on Earth from dangerous rays from the sun. Without ozone, life couldn't exist. The dangerous solar rays are called ultraviolet rays, or UV rays. UV rays can cause sunburn and skin cancer. Scientists first noticed the ozone hole in the 1970s. Since then, each year, the hole has opened above Antarctica for a few months in the fall. The largest hole formed in 2000. It was three times larger than the United States. This year, unusually severe storms caused the hole to split, say scientists. Cold temperatures in the atmosphere over Antarctica and chemical pollution cause the ozone hole. Chemicals that used to be in aerosol cans, air conditioners, and refrigerators made the pollution. To protect the atmosphere, people stopped using those dangerous chemicals in the mid-1990s. Although the chemicals are no longer used, they stay in the atmosphere for a long time. Scientists say the ozone hole will continue to form for a long time. But it should start getting smaller. Choose the statement that best summarizes the main idea of this story. 1. Ozone protects Earth from dangerous solar rays. 2. The largest ozone hole formed in 2000. 3. The ozone hole split in two.	4
"Peanuts may seem harmless, but to some kids they mean trouble. About one and a half million Americans are allergic to peanuts. Between 50 and 100 people, mostly kids, die each year from peanut allergies. For kids with peanut allergies, help may be on the way in the form of a new drug called TNX-901. Monthly shots of TNX-901 are not a cure, but they may save lives. Results suggest that the drug reduces the chance of a serious allergic reaction if peanuts are eaten accidentally. Eating just the tiniest amount of peanuts can make kids with peanut allergies very sick. For some of those kids, an allergic reaction can occur from just touching or smelling peanuts. Symptoms include stomach pain, hives, and tightness in the throat. It may be years before the treatment is available to the public. More testing needs to be done before the drug is approved. Researcher Donald Leung said the new drug could ""help lift a cloud of fear that people with peanut allergies live under every time they eat."" That is something that kids with peanut allergies won't find nutty. About 7 million Americans have food allergies. People can be allergic to almost any food. If you are allergic to any food, it is important to read labels carefully. Always ask an adult if you are not sure about what is in your food."	4
"Fall is here, and lots of boys and girls are hitting the football field. Playing football can be lots of fun, but it can also be dangerous. Kids need to play safely to make sure they have fun and do not get hurt. Most kids who play football get minor bruises and scrapes. Some injure their knees and even break bones. Others get head concussions. But a 10-year-old girl died on September 2. Doctors said a football injury probably caused the fatality. Taylor Davison, who lived in Illinois, liked to play football. She was the only girl who played in a football league of 400 players. Taylor played full-contact football. During a practice in August, she complained of a headache and fell down. Three days later, she died. Doctors said she died as a result of a severe blow to the head, possibly caused by a tackle. Doctors do not know how many child athletes are injured on the playing field each year. ""There is a serious lack of data about what types of injuries are occurring, said Dr. Reginald Washington, a doctor of sports medicine. Although not enough is known about sports-related injuries among children, Washington and other doctors say kids and coaches can follow certain safety tips. Researchers at the University of Pittsburgh give this advice: Coaches should receive first-aid training. They should also be trained to recognize whether a child athlete has a severe head injury."	4
"Last summer, a federal court in California ruled that the pledge is unconstitutional in public school classrooms. A law is considered unconstitutional if a court decides that it goes against the U.S. Constitution. The court ruled that the pledge is unconstitutional because it includes the phrase ""under God."" The court says that the phrase suggests that the government endorses, or supports, religion. That would violate the First Amendment to the Constitution. The First Amendment protects freedom of speech and prevents the government from establishing an official religion for the nation. The recent court ruling has angered many people across the country. They see the pledge as a way to express their patriotism, or loyalty, to the United States. Nine western states are part of the court's ruling. Students in those states were ordered to stop saying the pledge. Those states are Alaska, Arizona, California, Hawaii, Idaho, Montana, Oregon, Nevada, and Washington. However, the ruling has been temporarily put on hold. The Elk Grove School District in California, where the case began, has asked the Supreme Court of the United States to review and overturn the lower court's ruling. Do you think saying the pledge violates the First Amendment? Discuss in class. Then let us know in the Write On section of www.weeklyreader.com/kids/grade4."	4
Mattie suffers from a rare form of muscular dystrophy. That is a disease that weakens the muscles. Mattie is the 2003 National Goodwill Ambassador for the Muscular Dystrophy Association. Poetry helps Mattie cope with his disease. Weekly Reader (WR) talked to Mattie for National Poetry Month, which is celebrated in April. Here's what he had to say: Mattie: I love writing poetry because it helps me say what's in my heart. [It also lets me] celebrate all the beautiful things in the world. Mattie: I started writing poetry when I was 3 years old. I'd say how I felt about something, and my mom would write it down. When I got a little older, I wrote it down myself. Mattie: I like to write about seeing the hopeful side of things. I call my poems heartsongs because they're born in my heart and if I sit very still and listen, I can hear them. Mattie: I'd tell them... just think about something you care about and listen to your heart, and some words will come to you. Just say your feelings in your own words.	4
"The Arctic is the region around the North Pole. It is one of the coldest areas in the world. Polar bears rely on the Arctic ice for survival. In the Arctic, there is a lot of ice floating on top of the water. Polar bears use it as a bridge. The bears walk over the ice to get to seals, their main source of food. If the ice continues to melt, polar bears face starvation. Some scientists fear that polar bears may disappear within the next 100 years. ""You don't have to be a polar scientist to see that if you take away all the sea ice, you don't have polar bears anymore,"" said scientist Andrew Derocher. Many scientists blame global warming for causing the ice to melt. Global warming is the gradual worldwide rise in temperature. (See the sidebar.) Carbon dioxide is released into the air when people burn fossil fuels-coal, oil, and natural gas. People use fossil fuels when they drive cars or use electricity. Carbon dioxide and other gases trap the sun's heat in the air. That is called the greenhouse effect because a greenhouse works the same way. A greenhouse traps heat from the sun inside its glass walls. It is good to have some heat in the air. However, too much carbon dioxide in the air causes temperatures to rise too far. To help protect polar bears and other animals in the Arctic, scientists say people need to use less fossil fuels. The U.S. government is working on a plan to reduce global warming. The officials want to develop technology that does not release as much carbon dioxide into the air. Carbon dioxide and other gases in the atmosphere trap heat from the sun. The gases hold heat the same way a greenhouse does. That is called the greenhouse effect. It can cause a rise in the Earth's temperature. That rise is known as global warming."	4
It's not something you see too often at school - your principal kissing a pig! But for students at Tobin Elementary School in Cambridge, Massachusetts, it's a sight they won't forget anytime soon. Their principal, Donald Watson, puckered up to a pot-bellied pig named Daisy. He delivered the smooch to honor a bet he made with 410 students in kindergarten through eighth grade. Students had to reach their goal of reading at least 2,003 books by March 5. They exceeded their goal by reading 2,500 books. The event was part of Read Across America Day. Daisy arrived onstage to receive her kiss in a modified baby carriage. Daisy and her owner, Paul Minor, of Bristol, Connecticut, travel throughout the country to encourage reading among schoolchildren. Most teachers would agree-books are something to pig out on!	4
"Iraq is a country located in southwestern Asia. It is in a region known as the Middle East. Capital: Baghdad Area: 167,600 square miles (about twice the size of Idaho) Population: About 24 million people Government: Saddam Hussein became president in 1979. Iraq held its most recent presidential election in October 2002. There was no other candidate. Saddam received 100 percent of the vote. He controls all the power in Iraq. His birthday is even a national holiday. Media: The government in Iraq controls the news media. People: Most of the people in Iraq are Arabs. They speak Arabic, Iraq's official language. The Kurds make up a smaller group. They speak Kurdish, but some speak Arabic. Iraqi children greeted the soldiers with cheers. The troops were bringing water, food, medicine, and other supplies to the local people. That kind of help is called humanitarian aid. The aid marks the start of relief efforts to help rebuild Iraq, which has been at war. Many people in Iraq are suffering from shortages of food, water, and electricity. According to the World Food Program, about 13 million people in Iraq rely on food handouts. That is more than half the population. Before the war, Iraqis depended on food and supplies that were part of the United Nations' oil-for-food program. That program allowed Iraq to its sell oil to buy food and medical supplies. A new world-aid program is being started. In the meantime, aid workers from the United States and other countries are helping to restore electricity and fresh water to people in Iraq. They are also working on providing shelter for Iraqis who have lost their homes in the fighting. It has been hard work. Sandstorms, fighting, and bombs set in the water have delayed aid. Since coming to power in 1979, Saddam has used poisonous gas on his own people. He has also tortured and killed people who opposed his rule. The United States invaded Iraq because U.S. leaders claimed Saddam was hiding weapons of mass destruction. Weapons of mass destruction are chemical, biological, or nuclear weapons that kill large numbers of people. Invading Iraq, according to President George W. Bush, would help prevent the United States from becoming a target of Saddam's weapons. ""The security of the world requires disarming Saddam Hussein,"" said President Bush. This is not the first time the United States has fought a war with Saddam. In 1990, Iraq invaded Kuwait, a small country to its south. (See the map on page 8.) The United States and other countries sent troops to free Kuwait-launching the Persian Gulf War in 1991. The troops quickly defeated Iraq.

"The bus that Rosa Parks made famous has been restored, or fixed, to look the way it did on December 1, 1955. It is on exhibit at the Henry Ford Museum in Dearborn, Michigan. On December 1, 1955, Rosa Parks, a seamstress, boarded the bus in Montgomery, Alabama, on her way home from work. Refusing to give up her seat to a white man, Rosa Parks was arrested and sent to jail. Her arrest sparked the beginning of the Montgomery bus boycott. A boycott is a protest in which people refuse to buy, sell, or use something. As part of the boycott, African Americans refused to ride buses in Montgomery if they couldn't sit in the front. The Montgomery bus boycott lasted for over a year. In December 1956, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that it was unconstitutional to segregate, or separate, whites from African Americans on buses. An ordinary woman who made an extraordinary difference, Rosa Parks is often referred to as ""the Mother of the Civil Rights Movement."" She inspired a new era of civil rights in the United States."	4
America's roads are lined with some of the wackiest attractions you will ever see. The earliest roadside attractions opened at about the time people bought the first cars. Today, more people than ever are hitting the road and traveling by car. Many of those people are parking their cars in front of bizarre roadside attractions. What are some of these wacky wonders? If you are ever in Cawker City, Kansas, drop by to see the world's largest ball of twine. The ball is made of 7 million feet of twine and weighs 17,320 pounds. And it's still growing. If you're tired of riding in the car, you might want to stop in Holbrook, Arizona. There, you can sleep in a motel room shaped like a teepee. After a restful night in a teepee, you could go to Margate, New Jersey. There, you'll find Lucy the Elephant. Lucy isn't just any old elephant. She's a six-story-high model of an elephant that was built in 1881. So don't miss out on the wacky fun. Take a road trip with your family, and see what amazingly strange things you can find along the roadside.	4
"Eleven-year-old Michaela Piersanti from New Haven, Connecticut, thinks the environment needs to be protected all year long. ""We need to keep the Earth clean,"" she said. ""If we pollute, it can make animals sick and possibly kill them."" Pollution occurs when harmful substances are released into the air, water, or land. Water gets polluted from sewage, factories, and chemicals. Pollution harms the plants and animals that live in the water. It also makes drinking water unsafe. The theme of this year's Earth Day is ""Water for Life."" More than 1 billion people around the world do not have clean drinking water. Many children and their families will test the quality of their local water resources on Earth Day. Most of our energy comes from fossil fuels found underground. Coal, oil, and natural gas are examples of fossil fuels. Fossil fuels come from the remains of plants and animals that lived millions of years ago. The burning of fossil fuels pollutes the air and water. Many scientists think that contributes to the overheating of the Earth. The Earth Day Network wants people to rely more on clean sources of energy that don't pollute the environment. Some of those sources include sun, wind, and hydrogen power. For example, scientists are experimenting with hydrogen-powered cars that do not release harmful exhausts into the air the way today's gasoline-powered cars do. Why is it important to take care of the environment? Discuss this in class and let us know what you think in the Write On section of www.weeklyreader.com/kids/grade4."	4
"Tony and Ricki Guin are history buffs. They use metal detectors to search for metal objects from our country's past. Recently, they took their metal detectors to a schoolyard in Nashville, Tennessee. There they found metal objects from the Civil War. They found about 100 buttons in just one day. Each button may be worth about $25. After finding the artifacts, the Guin brothers researched the area where they had found them. It turns out that about 140 years ago, during the Civil War, the area was used as a hospital. People had forgotten that the area had played an important role in U.S. history. Just as the hospital became a school, other Civil War sites may be covered over. In the next ten years, many Civil War sites might disappear. People want to build houses, malls, and even golf courses on the sites. To protect the sites, the Civil War Preservation Trust has put together a list of the ten most endangered sites. The sites are located in eight U.S. states. The trust wants to raise enough money to buy the sites so that people can never build on them. The Civil War is one of the most important wars in U.S. history. It lasted from 1861 to 1865. During the Civil War, 11 states broke away from the United States. The U.S. government then declared war on the rebel states to bring them back into the United States. The breakaway states formed a new country called the Confederate States of America. The other states were called the Union. About 625,000 people died fighting the war. The Union won the war and the rebel states eventually rejoined the United States. The end of the war also brought about the end of slavery in the United States. The battles fought during the Civil War helped define what the United States is today. People want to protect the battlefields so that Americans will never forget their past. ""This land just doesn't belong to a developer or a landowner, it belongs to America,"" said James Lighthizer, who wants to preserve the battlefields."	4
"What do Stonehenge, the Taj Mahal, and the Everglades have in common? They are three of the 730 World Heritage sites around the world. World Heritage sites are areas that have special environmental, cultural, or historic value. Those sites are protected. They cannot be changed, dug up, or destroyed. In November 2002, the World Heritage Convention celebrated its 30th anniversary of protecting important places. The governments of 175 countries have joined the convention. Those governments have signed a treaty, or an agreement, to protect the world's special places. The treaty protects all kinds of places. It protects spectacular parks where dinosaur fossils are found and majestic mountains where amazing wildlife roam. Governments of the countries that have signed the World Heritage treaty nominate, or propose, sites that should be protected. The governments must also provide a plan for protecting each site. A committee of 21 people then decides which sites should be protected. Preserving important sites worldwide is important so future generations can appreciate and learn from them. The World Heritage Convention is ""a noble, vital force in the world, fostering peaceful coexistence and honoring our past in equal measure with our future,"" said one convention member."	4
"About 500 students from pre-K through fifth grade will attend the new school, said principal Jennifer Terrazas. It will open in August 2003. The school will be built between two schools that are filled to capacity. Students, their families, and staff members helped choose the new name. They narrowed 200 choices to five: Elks (for the name of the road the new school will be located on), Lincoln, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., Robledo (for an area mountain range), and Columbia. ""The kids felt really strongly about [Columbia],"" said Terrazas. ""It was the overwhelming winner."" More than 1,000 students cast their votes on electronic voting machines. ""It encouraged the democratic process and showed kids that their votes really do count,"" said Terrazas."	4
"Bello Nock recently raced up a thin wire on a motorcycle. He drove the motorcycle high over thousands of spectators' heads. He's a clown with the Ringling Bros. and Barnum and Bailey circus. To the spectators below, Bello's stunt looked dangerous-and it was. But Bello knew a secret. He was using science to help keep himself safe. Bello began performing circus stunts when he was 9 years old. He walked on a thin wire that was stretched 9 feet off the ground. To stay on a wire without falling, Bello needs to keep his center of gravity low. An object's center of gravity is usually located in the middle of the object. That is where the object's weight is centered. By crouching and keeping low, Bello keeps his center of gravity low. The lower his center of gravity, the harder it is for Bello to fall. Bello often carries a heavy metal stick when he performs. The stick bends downward, lowering his center of gravity. Bello also uses Newton's first law of motion when he performs. That law is named for Isaac Newton. He was a scientist who lived about 275 years ago. Newton's first law of motion says that a moving object will keep moving unless an outside force acts on it. (The law also says that an object at rest will stay that way unless an outside force acts on it.) Bello uses that law when he rides his miniature, or tiny, bike. As Bello speeds along on his tiny bike, he sometimes has to stop before slamming into a wall. To stop, Bello uses the bike's brakes. The brakes create friction between the bike's tires and the ground. The friction is an outside force that slows the bike. Friction also changes the bike's motion into heat energy. You could say that Bello's act is really hot! How do you use science in your everyday life? Discuss in class and let us know what you think in the Write On section ofwww.weeklyreader.com/kids/grade4 Bello always puts on a high-energy show. ""I always want to capture the attention of children,"" he said. He captures their attention with science."	4
"About 370 species, or kinds, of sharks live in the waters around the world. The researchers found that populations of some of the best-known sharks, including hammerheads and great whites, have been affected. The hammerhead suffered the steepest drop-an 89 percent decrease. The number of great white sharks declined by 79 percent. According to scientists, the dramatic drop in shark populations is due to overfishing. The shark population is also threatened because sharks develop slowly and do not reproduce as quickly as other types of fish. Many sharks are accidentally killed as bycatch, or unwanted catch, in nets meant for tuna and swordfish. Some scientists think that tighter laws on fishing could protect sharks. For example, some sharks migrate, or move to another place, along set paths at certain times of the year. Some scientists say that preventing fishing during those times might help protect sharks from being accidentally killed. Another risk to sharks are the people who kill them for their fins, which are used to make shark-fin soup. The United States prohibits that practice. The decline in the shark population has scientists worried. All plants and animals in the ocean depend on one another for food. The link between them is called the food chain. Sharks are predators at the top of the food chain. A predator is an animal that survives by eating other animals. Sharks hunt, or prey upon, other animals such as seals and tuna. Seals and tuna eat smaller fish. Those smaller fish feed on tiny fish and ocean plants. ""Sharks are adapted to being the predators, not the prey,"" said one scientist. Scientists say that if sharks are wiped out, it would negatively impact other marine life in the food chain. What do you think should be done to protect sharks? Discuss in class. Then let us know in the Write On section of www.weeklyreader.com/kids/grade4."	4
Have you ever touched the bottom of a desk or a table and found that you were touching a blob of old chewing gum? Schools long ago banned chewing gum to keep kids from sticking gum to school furniture. Officials in Singapore, a country in Asia, totally banned chewing gum about ten years ago. Now that country is allowing people to chew some kinds of gum again. Gum chewers, however, will need a doctor's prescription. A government official said Singapore will allow pharmacies to sell sugarless gum to sick patients if the rubbery substance can help cure them. Singapore outlawed gum in 1992. Government officials were concerned that gum chewers were throwing lumps of used gum on streets. People, they said, were also sticking gum to subway cars. Yuck!	4
Your body is constantly under attack. Dirt and germs surround your body. Only one thing stands between dirt and the organs inside your body-skin. Skin may not seem very important, but it is. It protects your body from burns, dirt, germs, and dangerous rays from the sun. It keeps fluids inside your body. And it contains all the nerves that allow you to feel things. Skin is the largest organ in your body. If you stretched out an adult's skin into a flat sheet, it would cover an area of about 21 square feet. A square foot is a square whose sides each measure 1 foot. Skin may cover a large area, but it is very thin. It is only about 1/8 inch thick. Despite being so thin, skin is made of three layers. The outermost layer is the epidermis. Just below the outermost layer is the dermis. Beneath those two layers is the subcutaneous tissue. The epidermis contains a chemical called keratin. Keratin makes skin tough and waterproof. Keratin keeps germs out of your body. The dermis is mainly made of blood vessels and nerve endings. The dermis provides the epidermis with food and oxygen. The lowest layer, the subcutaneous tissue protects the body from blows. It also regulates the body's temperature. All three layers of your skin protect you. Because your skin protects you, you should protect it by keeping it clean and eating a healthful diet. You should use sunblock when you are in the sun. If you take care of your skin, it will last a lifetime.	4
"Students from Camden's Promise Charter School in New Jersey recently finished both a canned-food drive and a clothing drive. And they are currently helping a local literacy agency reach its goal of collecting 20,000 books. Jesse Coltrane, a 15-year-old student at Camden's Promise, says that kids can help people in need through school and community projects. Like Jesse, thousands of students will be working in their schools and communities to make the world a better place during National Volunteer Week (April 27 through May 3). This year will mark the 30th anniversary of National Volunteer Week. The theme of this year's week is ""Celebrate Volunteers-The Spirit of America."" As part of this year's week, kids across the United States will be taking part in service projects. Many kids will also participate in community events to honor volunteers. ""When you volunteer, you help America become strong. You become an instant champion!"" -Melissa Helmbrecht Champions of Hope is made up of more than 650,000 kids across the country and includes Jesse Coltrane and other students at Camden's Promise. Champions of Hope participants across the country are volunteering to collect food for the hungry, clean parks, and raise money for firefighters. Champions of Hope started a United Day of Service on September 11, 2002, one year after the terrorist attack on the World Trade Center. On that day, The Lord of the Rings star Sean Astin spoke to youths gathered at the Lincoln Memorial in Washington, D.C., about the importance of civic action. Astin plays hobbit Sam Gamgee in the movie. Astin told Weekly Reader, ""It is our responsibility to keep making the world a better place. We can do that by helping others."" Sixth-grade student Matthew Malon from Illinois attended the September 11, 2002, rally and has collected food for homeless shelters. Astin's speech on volunteering moved him. Some students from Camden's Promise also attended the rally. Students Damian Johnson, Keith Bennett, and Tashay Moody agree that it's important for kids to volunteer.As 16-year-old Damian Johnson puts it: ""[Volunteering] makes me feel like I have made an impact on people who don't have as much as I have."" ""How can I make a difference in the world if I'm just an ordinary kid?"" Thirteen-year-old author Sondra Clark answers that question in her fourth book, You Can Change Your World!, which hit bookstores in March. She shows kids that small actions, such as donating videos to a children's hospital, can make a big difference. Clark was motivated to write her book after reading an article on volunteerism in Weekly Reader. She has traveled to Africa to help children. Currently, she is traveling across the United States with her parents to share her experiences. The action doesn't stop for actor Sean Astin when the cameras stop rolling. Astin, one of the stars of The Lord of the Rings movies and the father of two young children, is inspiring kids to make the world a better place. In January, Astin was appointed to the President's Council on Service and Civic Participation. President George W. Bush created the council to encourage volunteerism. He has urged Americans to make a lifetime commitment to volunteering. Astin tells kids that it's easy to make a difference. As a teenager in Santa Monica, California, he volunteered his time helping preschool students cross the street. He told Weekly Reader, ""I remember feeling that because I was helping someone, I had an incredible responsibility, and it felt great. It made me a better person."""	4
"Two kid reporters got a thrill this past summer. They traveled to Hollywood to interview the stars of Spy Kids 2. The reporters, Lyndi Conradt, a fifth grader from Texas, and Meagan Tromburg, a sixth grader from Washington, were the grand-prize winners in last year's ""I'm a Weekly Reader Reader"" essay contest. The contest was sponsored by Dimension Films. Alexa: When I am standing on a cliff fighting the skeletons. That was exciting and amazing. It was above the Rio Grande-an 800-foot drop. It was really up there. If you put your arms out, you felt like you were flying. Matthew: I'm very different from Gary Giggles. I'm not as mean as he is. He can be a jerk sometimes."	4
"A peanut butter and jelly sandwich is usually easy to make. You take two slices of bread and slather peanut butter and jelly on them. But, for the U.S. Army, making the sandwich is not that easy. Some of the Army's top scientists have been trying to make peanut butter and jelly sandwiches for four years. The Army's sandwiches have to taste good and last for three years without refrigeration. Army scientists have already made pepperoni and barbecue chicken sandwiches. They used special chemicals to keep the sandwiches fresh. The sandwiches ""will last a minimum of three years at 80 degrees and six months at 100 degrees. They will travel to the swampiest swamp, the highest mountain, the most arid desert,"" said one army scientist. Peanut butter and jelly sandwiches pose a special problem. Mold keeps growing on them. Mold or no mold, some soldiers say the long-lasting sandwiches leave a bad taste in their mouths. ""I don't think I've ever wanted a sandwich that's that old,"" said Master Sergeant Kelly Tyler."	4
A large storm is brewing in space. In a few days, that storm should sweep past Earth. Don't worry; the storm shouldn't cause any damage. It is a meteor shower. The meteor shower will take place on November 18 and 19. The shower is called the Leonid meteor shower. That's because most of the meteors will appear to come from the constellation Leo the lion. A constellation is a group of stars that seems to make a picture. Meteors are also known as falling stars. They are called falling stars because some people used to think that meteors were stars falling from the sky. Today, we know that meteors are bits of dust and rock from space. As a meteor speeds through the atmosphere, friction causes it to heat up. The meteor gets so hot that it glows and appears to streak through the sky as it moves. The dust that forms the Leonid meteor shower came from a comet. A comet is a large ball of frozen dust and gas that orbits, or goes around, the sun. When a comet comes close to the sun, it begins to melt. Dust from the comet streams into space and over time spreads out along the comet's path around the sun. The dust that forms the Leonid meteor shower comes from the comet Tempel-Tuttle. It orbits the sun about once every 33 years. On November 18 and 19, Earth will pass through comet Tempel-Tuttle's orbit. The meteor shower will take place in North America on the 19th. But only the early bird will catch it. The peak of the shower will take place at 5:30 a.m. Don't worry about any of the Leonids falling on you. They will all burn up high in Earth's atmosphere. You won't need an umbrella.	4
The Supreme Court hears only certain cases. Once the Court rules on a case, the decision is final. All other courts in the United States must follow the Supreme Court's decision in similar cases. This helps make sure that all Americans receive equal justice.	4
"Did you know that the average child will spend more time in front of the television than at school this year? That's according to the TV-Turnoff Network. Beginning April 21, millions of children and their families across the country will trade some TV time for other activities. They will zap off their television sets for an entire week. April 21 through 27 is the ninth annual TV-Turnoff Week. ""The idea of the week is to encourage people to take a break from TV,"" said Frank Vespe of the TV-Turnoff Network. ""One of the things we learn is that TV is taking away from other things that we might do for fun."" The goal of the week, according to its organizers, is to help kids discover other activities they enjoy. Then kids may make lasting changes in their lives. Health experts warn that too much television can have negative effects on kids. Children who spend too much time watching television often get too little exercise. They also don't perform as well in school as do children who watch less TV. Choose the statement that best summarizes the main idea of this story. 1. This is the ninth year of TV-Turnoff Week. 2. Many kids like to watch TV. 3. TV-Turnoff Week lets kids discover other activities they enjoy."	4
"Have you given a teddy bear a big bear hug lately? You should; the teddy bear is 100 years old this year. The teddy bear is named for a former U.S. president,Theodore (Teddy) Roosevelt. He became president in September 1901. Before becoming president, Roosevelt was an American hero. In 1898, he led a famous cavalry regiment in the Spanish-American War. His regiment was called the Rough Riders. The Rough Riders won an important battle during the war. After becoming a war hero, Roosevelt was elected as the governor of New York. He then became President William McKinley's vice president. When McKinley was killed, Roosevelt became president. Roosevelt liked lots of activities. He liked boxing, hiking, horseback riding, hunting, and swimming. When he liked something, Roosevelt would enthusiastically say, ""Bully."" 1. Teddy Roosevelt was a U.S. president. 2. Teddy bears are named for Theodore Roosevelt. 3. The teddy bear is 100 years old."	4
"If you had to choose one invention you couldn't live without, which would it be-the toothbrush, car, cell phone, or microwave oven? That was the question asked of American teens and adults in a survey conducted by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). The toothbrush emerged as the number-one invention that Americans can't live without. Following closely in second place was the car. These findings show that important inventions do not have to be complicated. ""In today's high-tech society, we thought people would be voting for the high-tech inventions,"" said Kristin Joyce, a spokesperson at MIT. ""The results show that simple, low-tech inventions are important to people."" The toothbrush has a long history, dating back to the 15th century. According to the American Dental Association, the first toothbrush was invented in 1498. To make the brush, a Chinese emperor placed hog bristles in a bone handle. In 1938, nylon bristles replaced pig bristles. Dentists today are eager to remind people that while the toothbrush has taken the throne as king of the invention list, it still needs its handy sidekick-dental floss."	4
Architect Daniel Libeskind remembers seeing the New York City skyline for the first time. His first glimpse of the United States was the Statue of Liberty. It was 1959, and he was a 13-year-old arriving in the United States on a boat from Poland. His family was immigrating, or moving into a new country. Now, Libeskind will contribute to reshaping the New York City skyline. His design has been chosen for rebuilding the World Trade Center site. It was chosen from hundreds of plans. Libeskind's design includes a tower that stands 1,776 feet tall-a number that has symbolic meaning. It stands for the year the Declaration of Independence was signed and the United States gained freedom from Britain. The tower would be the tallest structure in the world. The new design will include a memorial to the nearly 3,000 people killed when the twin towers fell on September 11, 2001, after terrorist attacks. The plan also includes indoor gardens that will fill the top floors of the tower. Officials estimate that restoring the site will take between 10 and 12 years. Because of the complexity of the design, planners also say that the final design could look different from the original design.	4
"The Toy Industry Association has come up with a list of the 100 most treasured toys from the past century. It's all part of the 100th anniversary of the American International Toy Fair that was held in New York City in February. Here are a few favorites chosen by the editors at Weekly Reader. For more toys, visit www.weeklyreader.com/kids/grade 4. Are any of these in your family's toy chest? Take a peek. John Lloyd Wright, son of the famous architect Frank Lloyd Wright, invented Lincoln Logs in 1916. He came up with the idea during a trip to Japan with his dad, who was designing an earthquake-proof building. Arthur Melin and Richard Knerr invented the Hula Hoop in 1958. They got the idea from a friend who saw schoolchildren in Australia twirling bamboo hoops around their waists for exercise. Do you know Barbie's full name? Barbara Millicent Roberts was created in 1959. Today, three Barbie dolls are sold around the world every second. Slinky was invented by accident. In the early 1940s, a spring fell off the desk of Richard James, a marine engineer. It tumbled end over end across the floor. The first battery-powered train was created in 1900 by Joshua Lionel Cowen not as a toy but as a window display to get New Yorkers into his store. More shoppers were interested in the Lionel train than the other products in the window. Since then more than 50 million Lionel train sets have been sold. In 1949, Ole Kirk Christiansen invented plastic LEGO bricks in Denmark. Since then more than 206 billion have been made. LEGO comes from the Danish Leg Godt, which means ""play well."" In 1964, G.I. Joe became the world's first action figure. Today, two out of every three American boys own a G.I. Joe action figure. Crayola crayons turn 100 this year! In 1903, Edwin Binney and C. Harold Smith made the first box of Crayola crayons. Each day, 12 million crayons are made. By age 10, the average child will have worn down 730 crayons. Mr. Potato Head was invented in 1952 and celebrated his 50th birthday in 2002. He was the first toy to be advertised on television. In 1987, he was honored at a White House ceremony when he turned his pipe over to the U.S. Surgeon General. Sculptor Xavier Roberts first showcased Cabbage Patch Kids as part of an art exhibit. The Cabbage Patch Kids became the most successful dolls in history, with more than 3 million sold in 1983, their first year on the market."	4
"Imagine having a twin that you didn't know existed. For Tamara Rabi and her sister, Adriana Scott, it was like a fairy tale come true. The twin girls, now 20, were adopted in Mexico by different sets of parents in the United States. As luck would have it, the girls grew up in the same area in New York and went to different colleges near each other. A common friend insisted the girls were twins and put them in contact. The girls exchanged The girls were stunned to learn that they each had a sister. Tamara's adoptive mother was surprised, too. Adriana's adoptive mother was aware that her daughter had a twin, but that was all she knew. Besides looking alike and being the same height, the girls have a lot in common. They love to dance, and both started lessons when they were young. Upon meeting her sister for the first time, Adriana said, ""It was a shock. I saw me."""	4
These days, almost everyone seems to have a cell phone. Last year, 128 million people had cell phone service. More and more people sign up every day. Many people keep their cell phones for only a short time. On average, people throw away their cell phones after 18 months. According to a new report issued by the Environmental Protection Agency, old cell phones could harm the environment. By 2005, people in the United States will throw away 130 million phones a year. That's 65,000 tons of phones! Environmental experts worry that the chemicals in cell phone batteries could pollute the environment. They want the companies that make cell phones to use fewer poisonous chemicals to make the phones.	4
People saw green, blue, and red lights. The lights formed different patterns. Some looked like rings. Others looked like curtains. And still others looked like pillars. The lights continually changed shape and color. The shimmering lights were auroras. Auroras are also called the northern lights and southern lights. Usually, only people living close to the North Pole and South Pole see auroras. But auroras were unusually active this fall. Even people in Arizona saw the lights. Auroras are caused by the solar wind and Earth's magnetic field. The solar wind is made of tiny particles that stream away from the sun. Earth's magnetic field is similar to the field that surrounds a magnet. When the solar wind strikes Earth's magnetic field, gases in our atmosphere glow. Those glowing gases form an aurora. The kind of glowing gas determines an aurora's color. Glowing oxygen makes red, yellow, and green auroras. Glowing hydrogen and helium make blue and purple auroras. Don't worry if you missed the colorful auroras in October. An aurora can form at any time of year. If the solar wind continues to be as strong as it was in the fall, you may see the northern lights on any clear night. The sun is about 93 million miles from Earth. You could line up more than 1 billion hot dogs end to end between Earth and the sun. If you could drive to the sun in your family's car, it would take you nearly 2 million years. That's if you drove 55 miles per hour and didn't take any rest stops. Light from the sun travels a lot faster than you can in your car. A beam of light travels at about 186,000 miles per second. It takes sunlight a little more than 8 minutes to reach Earth.	4
"On a December morning, shortly before dawn, Danny Thompson, age 10, looked through a small telescope. He saw a round red disk-Mars. ""Someday I will go to Mars,"" Danny said later. Over the years, many people have dreamed of going to Mars. The day when travel to Mars is possible is coming closer. Robot spacecraft have already traveled there. Those spacecraft have made many amazing discoveries. The most recent spacecraft to journey to the fourth rock from the sun is Mars Odyssey. It started orbiting the red planet more than a year ago. Recent photos taken by Mars Odyssey show that Mars has water. Because it is very cold on Mars, the water is frozen. Most of the water is frozen under the surface of Mars. Even though lots of ice crystals are mixed in with the Martian soil, Mars doesn't have as much water as Earth has. Mars has lakes of water, not oceans of water. In fact, scientists say that if you collected all the water on Mars, it would fill a lake about twice the size of Lake Michigan. There is evidence that some of the frozen water locked under the surface of Mars might melt every once in a while. Some of the water is only 18 inches below the surface. Molten rock deep beneath the surface of Mars might heat the ice. The melted ice might mix with salt deposits in the Martian soil and flow down steep canyon walls. Not all scientists agree, however. Many scientists say wind blowing across Mars caused the streaks. Scientists have long known about powerful wind storms on Mars. Some of those storms blow across the surface for months at a time. Even if liquid water and life do not exist on Mars today, many scientists agree with Danny. They want to explore the red planet. ""I'm interested in Mars because it's probably the most fascinating planet in the solar system besides Earth, and probably the only one that could have ever supported other forms of life,"" said one NASA scientist."	4

"Environmental experts are working hard to clean up beaches in Spain. Spain and Portugal are two countries in Europe. Some of their beaches are covered with oil that leaked from a tanker called the Prestige. Oil from the tanker formed a huge slick on the ocean. Much of the oil washed up on nearby beaches. It covered at least 150 miles of coastline, killing fish, birds, and other animals. Some experts say cleaning up the oil-soaked beaches could take years. A few days after the tanker began leaking oil, it broke in half. After the tanker broke apart, its stern, or back, sank quickly. Its bow, or front, remained on the ocean surface for several hours. The ship sank about 150 miles off the coast of Spain. About 18 million gallons of oil are still inside the ship. The weight of the ocean water pressing on the ship could cause the oil tanks on the ship to explode, spewing oil across the ocean floor. Even if the oil tanks don't explode, they will rust and leak. ""[The ship is] a time bomb at the bottom of the sea,"" said one expert. ""There's nothing that makes us believe it won't finally burst and leak all its oil."""	4
"The 22-year-old man from Alaska lost the use of his legs seven years ago in a car accident. He is believed to be the first paraplegic to climb Mount Fuji. ""I want to show people what I am able to do,"" Reilly said from the top of Mount Fuji. ""Maybe it will inspire them."" How exactly did he make his climb? Reilly used a special bike that he powered with his arms. Reilly traveled with a support team of eight people and reached the summit, or peak, of the mountain within four days. The climb normally takes about six hours. Reilly's journey, however, was not without obstacles. His team was stopped by a park ranger who said mountain bikes weren't allowed on the trail. They managed to persuade the park ranger to allow them to continue their journey. Although Reilly's bike was built to climb rocks, the trail was covered with volcanic ash and gravel, making for a difficult ride. Now that he has accomplished his goal, he has already set his sights even higher. He hopes to climb Mount Rainier in Alaska and the tallest peak in South America. ""I hope to climb one mountain every year,"" he said."	4
"What is one of your worst nightmares about the school day? No recess! For students in cities across the country, from Atlanta to Las Vegas, break time is over. Elementary-school children at the Clark County School District in Las Vegas recently said good-bye to recess. Why has this Las Vegas district and many others eliminated, or removed, recess? School officials say they want students to have more classroom time to learn. They also hope that more time in class will help students perform better on their standardized tests. The students in Clark County have a 30-minute lunch period. They have to squeeze playground minutes into that half-hour block. They no longer get an additional 15- to 20-minute recess. Many teachers, parents, and students disagree with the decision to ban recess. Education experts often say that recess is an important part of the school day. Those experts say that the benefits of recess outweigh the lost class time. Recess gives students the opportunity to take a break, exercise, and socialize with their friends. At recess, many students learn how to cooperate and play with other students. In addition, some studies show a recess break can help improve test scores. One fifth grader in Virginia told the Washington Times she looks forward to the daily break so she can return fresh to her schoolwork. ""I feel like I'm ready for anything that comes my way,"" she said."	4
"Gary Gero says he has the best job in the world. As one of Hollywood's top animal trainers, Gero prepares his animal ""talent"" for their onscreen performances. Recently, Gero completed work for the movie Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, which opens in theaters June 4. His team, which included six trainers for this movie, worked with dozens of animals. Their lineup for the film included cats, dogs, owls, rats, crows-and even a hippo! Fang the dog, Mrs. Norris the cat, Scabbers the rat, and Hedwig the owl star in this film. They also appeared in the previous Harry Potter films. To train the animals, Gero and his team reward them with food and praise when they follow instructions correctly. Owls may get a reputation for being wise, but Gero knows differently. Gero told Weekly Reader that Hedwig learned to fly in front of a fan-a trick that was mastered after six months of training. ""Owls are difficult to train because they're not very clever,"" he said. ""It takes a long time to teach them things."""	4
"Some call his journey remarkable. Others call it just plain crazy. For Christopher Swain, it was the swim of a lifetime. Swain recently made history as the first person to swim the entire length of the Columbia River. In July 2003, the Oregon man ended a yearlong journey to raise awareness about pollution in that river. His 1,243-mile trip began in Canada and ended where the river meets the ocean-the Pacific Ocean. Why did he do it? ""Every waterway needs a champion,"" Swain told Weekly Reader. ""I learned as much as I could about the river so I could see what I could do to clean it up."" In 1805, explorers Meriwether Lewis and William Clark were journeying west to find a passage to the Pacific Ocean. At that time, they described the Columbia River as clear, free flowing, and teeming with, or full of, salmon. The Columbia River has changed since the days of Lewis and Clark's journey. Today, it is ravaged by pollution. Pollution occurs when harmful materials contaminate, or damage, the air, water, or land. Chemicals and waste from factories and towns contribute to water pollution. The pollution has caused a drop in the river's salmon population. The 14 dams that have been built along the river mean the Columbia no longer flows freely. The dams are water barriers that provide electricity, control flooding, and carry water to farms. The pollution in the river inspired Swain to take action. Wearing out seven wetsuits along the way and battling several colds, Swain braved water temperatures as low as 38 degrees. Followed by a boat, he swam between 5 and 25 miles a day through the polluted water. ""The Columbia River is a contaminated beauty,"" Swain told Weekly Reader. ""It runs through some of the most majestic landscapes on Earth."" Despite the pollution, Swain is hopeful about the future of the river. During his journey, he spoke with nearly 13,000 people, including 8,000 schoolchildren, about keeping the river clean. ""With all the affection for the river, we have a chance to turn the [pollution problem] around,"" Swain said. ""Kids know that they want clean water."" Earlier last year, Swain received the International Earth Day Award for protecting the Columbia River. And he hasn't finished making a splash yet! Later this year, he plans to swim in Lake Champlain, which borders Vermont and New York, the Hudson River in New York, and the Charles River in Boston. How will Swain celebrate Earth Day on April 22? ""I will be in an East Coast waterway on Earth Day,"" he promised. Each year, people celebrate Earth Day on April 22. They participate in community activities and care for the environment. This year, the Earth Day theme is ""Water for Life."" Here are some ways experts say that kids can help protect water:"	4
"Take me out to the... art museum? Yes, you've heard right! Baseball is being honored with a new art exhibit. The exhibit, ""The Perfect Game: America Looks at Baseball,"" celebrates our national pastime. It is being shown at the American Folk Art Museum in New York City. To enter the exhibit, visitors walk through a turnstile similar to one they would find at a baseball stadium. Inside, more than 100 objects from 1840 through the present are on display. The exhibit includes scorecards, baseball cards, bats, painted baseballs, artwork, and even an autographed quilt among its many items. ""It's baseball history and trivia,"" Elizabeth Warren toldWeekly Reader when describing the exhibit she organized. ""It combines baseball and art."" ""Jackie Robinson was a hero both on and off the field,"" said Warren. ""He's such a great role model."""	4
But Nefertiti was more than just a pretty face. She is believed to have been one of the most powerful women who ever lived. She ruled Egypt more than 3,000 years ago. Egypt is a country in Africa. Mysteriously, no one knows how Queen Nefertiti died. Her remains have never been found--until now, perhaps. A team of archaeologists led by Joann Fletcher uncovered three mummies in a tomb in Egypt. (Archaeologists are scientists who dig up ancient objects and study them to learn about the past.) Fletcher believes that one of the mummies is Queen Nefertiti. Modern science is helping Fletcher prove her idea and identify the face of the mummy. After X-rays of the mummy were taken, scientists put together a computerized version of what the face would have looked like. What they discovered was amazing! The re-created face resembles a famous sculpture of Queen Nefertiti that was made during her reign. Scientists are quick to point out that the computerized version of the face does not prove that the mummy is Queen Nefertiti. The re-created face, however, isn't the only clue to the past. There are other pieces of the puzzle that make Fletcher's team think the mummy is Nefertiti. First, the mummy's hair had been shaved off. Nefertiti preferred a shaved head so that her crown would fit tightly. A shaved head also helped her stay cool in Egypt's heat. Second, traces of a wig found next to the mummy matched the kind Nefertiti would have worn. In addition, the mummy's left earlobe was pierced twice. Statues of Nefertiti show her having a double-pierced ear. The mummy's forehead showed the mark of a tight-fitting band--a sign of royalty. Another clue was the mummy's bent arm, which was broken off. Royalty were usually buried with their arms bent. Another scientist from Egypt expressed doubts that the mummy is even a female. He said that both men and women could have double-pierced ears. The mummy which may be Nefertiti lies in Egypt's Valley of the Kings. That is an ancient burial ground for royalty. It is located in the desert, south of Cairo (the capital of Egypt) and along the west bank of the Nile River. Scientists are starting to piece together more about the legendary queen's life. Nefertiti is now one of the most popular faces from ancient history, but that wasn't always the case. Queen Nefertiti and her husband, the pharaoh, ruled Egypt together and had many enemies. Pharaoh is a name given to Egyptian kings. The pharaoh and Nefertiti were disliked because they challenged the religion of the time. They began to worship one god instead of many gods. As part of their new religion, they moved from the city of Thebes and built a new capital in the heart of the desert. The new capital was called Akhetaton (ah-keh-TAHT-uhn).	4
"A German man knows what it's like to win by a whisker. In November 2003, Karl Heinz Hille beat out 130 contestants to be crowned the World Beard and Moustache champion. ""I feel happy as a pig in mud,"" said the bearded champ. Hille sported thick white sideburns from his ears to his chin. This year's competition was held in Carson City, the capital of Nevada. It was the first time the contest was held outside Europe. Winners in 17 categories walked away with trophies and bragging rights. While Germans tend to dominate, or lead, the competition, Americans are making some headway. An Alaskan man placed third in the contest, becoming the first American to finish among the top three in the event's history."	4
"As a result, the pressure is on for soft-drink companies to find new ways to stay in school. Some companies, such as Coca-Cola and Cadbury Schweppes, are introducing new milk-based drinks in different flavors to be sold in schools. Some experts claim, though, that the milk-based drinks are still too high in sugar. In fact, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration won't allow the makers of those products to use the word milk in their names. That's because the beverages don't have enough calcium and other minerals in them. Calcium is a mineral found in milk and other dairy products that helps build strong teeth and bones. Soft-drink giants aren't the only beverage companies trying to find their place in school districts. As part of a deal with New York City, Snapple will be the only drink company to have vending machines in the city's schools. To meet the city's rules banning high-sugar foods from schools, Snapple had to create four new 100-percent juice drinks. Not good enough, say some nutrition experts who claim the new Snapple drinks have more calories and sugar in them than soft drinks have. Unlike orange juice and grapefruit juice, the new juices contain only small amounts of nutrients and vitamins. ""The fact is... they are pretty much the same as a [soft drink],"" said one expert."	4
"Nearly 2,000 years ago, Vesuvius exploded with tremendous force. Deadly smoke, gases, and rock shot more than 9 miles high in the air. That is about one and a half times the height of Mount Everest, the world's tallest mountain. A thick black cloud engulfed the region and blocked out the sun. An avalanche of boiling lava poured from the volcano at speeds of up to 70 miles per hour. Lava is melted rock from a volcano. The explosion sealed the ancient city of Pompeii (pahm-PAY) under a blanket of rock and ash. A mudslide wiped out the nearby town of Herculaneum (her-kyuh-LAY-nee-uhm). Many people died as a result of the volcano's fury. Although many eruptions have occurred since then, Vesuvius hasn't exploded with such force since that devastating day. The last major eruption occurred in 1944. Scientists warn, though, that it's only a matter of time before Mount Vesuvius erupts with tremendous force again. ""It won't be tomorrow, it won't be next month, and maybe it won't be next year,"" a scientist who monitors the volcano told USA Today. ""But [Vesuvius] is overdue [to explode]."" Today, nearly 600,000 people live in the 18 towns surrounding Vesuvius. This high-risk area is known as the ""red zone."" Officials estimate that they would need two weeks to evacuate all the people living in the red zone. According to scientists, anything within 4 miles of Vesuvius could be destroyed during the first 15 minutes of an eruption. Some families are being offered $36,000 to move to safer locations. The goal is to persuade about 150,000 families to move from the area near the volcano within the next 15 years. In 1995, the government also created a national park near the top of Vesuvius. That limits the number of people living there. ""Vesuvius is the most dangerous volcano in the world on account of the number of people living under it,"" said the president of the Naples region. ""The smaller the population, the smaller the danger Vesuvius represents."" A volcano is a mountain with an opening on the top called a crater.A volcano erupts when hot, melted rock called magma collects in chambers beneath Earth's surface. Pressure builds up in the chambers and causesmagma, gases, ash, and other materials to blast out of the top of the volcano and vents, or cracks, along its sides. Once outside the volcano, the magma is called lava."	4
"Weekly Reader kid reporter Sonia Mia Diaz blasted into space on August 22. This 10-year-old from Florida was on a journey to Mars. Sonia Mia rocketed to Mars aboard a new ride called Mission: SPACE. She experienced the ride during its opening week at Walt Disney World's Epcot Center in Orlando, Florida. After her mission, Sonia Mia interviewed Sue Bryan, one of the ride's creators. Sonia Mia learned that Disney worked closely with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) to develop the new space attraction. The ride lets people experience what a trip to Mars might be like in the future. On her journey, Sonia Mia never actually left the ground. The ride gives people the feeling of blasting off and traveling through space. ""We really wanted people to feel as close as they could to what it's like to be an astronaut,"" said Bryan. Sonia Mia read quotes about space exploration as she waited in line. Information about space history fills the attraction. There is even a moon car called a lunar rover on loan from a museum. Before boarding the shuttle, Sonia Mia and three other riders were given different roles for the mission. Those roles included commander, pilot, navigator, and engineer. Sonia Mia was assigned to be the engineer. In real life, Sally Ride, the first U.S. woman in space, performed the same role. After Sonia Mia strapped herself in, the shuttle moved into launch position. The countdown began, and the shuttle blasted off! During the mission, Sonia Mia and her team used buttons and joysticks to perform the tasks associated with their roles. The ride lasted about 4 minutes. The mission was as intense as Sonia Mia had hoped. What was her favorite part? The liftoff! ""I liked the intensity of the blastoff and the air pressure on my face,"" she said. So how did the ride live up to a real space shuttle mission? Weekly Reader caught up with NASA astronaut Winston Scott to ask him that question. Scott launched into space on two shuttle flights. He tested out Mission: SPACE and gave it a big thumbs up. ""It's a thrill a minute,"" he said. Although no astronauts have been to Mars yet, Scott said the ride's liftoff was realistic. The feeling of moving up the launch pad and being forced back into your seat were similar to those felt on a shuttle. However, he points out, there are differences. In an actual launch, astronauts feel about three times the force of gravity. Gravity is the force that pulls things toward Earth. The blastoff on the ride was also shorter than an actual liftoff. And, he said, riders don't experience weightlessness. On a real space shuttle, astronauts become weightless because there is no gravity. For many people, the ride brings to mind the courage of space explorers. As Sonia Mia pointed out, ""Going on the ride made me think about how brave astronauts are."" Sonia Mia Diaz interviewed Sue Bryan, one of the forces behind Mission: SPACE. Here's what Sonia Mia learned. In general, Imagineering is about storytelling. We build attractions that put people who visit our parks into different worlds and stories. We also use technology to tell stories. Bryan: I'm the senior show producer, which is like being a movie director. A movie director guides people and directs the show, including the lighting, music, artists, and motion you experience on the ride. Bryan: People have always had an interest in space. The time and technology were right to create this new space attraction. We worked closely with NASA to develop the science and technology behind the attraction. No one has ever put people into a ride system like this before. Sonia Mia: Before the ride, I was warned not to move my head or close my eyes because of motion sickness. I didn't feel sick, but might a person if he or she does those things? Bryan: That could happen if you move your head, because of the technology used to create the ride. We give those recommendations because we want people to feel most comfortable. Some people can move their heads, and it doesn't bother them at all."	4
"The United Nations (U.N.) is working to solve that problem. The U.N. is an organization made up of countries around the world. The countries work to promote world peace and to better the lives of poor people, including children. The U.N. was formed on October 24, 1945. Each year, the U.S. president asks people to observe this anniversary as U.N. Day. This October, the day will be focused on literacy, which is the ability to read and write. Many communities around the world will celebrate U.N. Day. Some schools will participate in special projects to draw attention to improving reading skills. To do our part for this special day, Weekly Reader has donated 800 children's books to a literacy organization in Darien, Connecticut. Called the Book Aid Plan, this group is run by volunteers. They help put books in the hands of people in need around the world. The organization gets the most requests for children's books. Based on the letters they receive, the volunteers at Book Aid decide which books to send and then pack the boxes. This year, they will ship more than 50,000 pounds of books to almost 100 different countries. ""We may think a shipment is small, but we'll hear from volunteers saying we tripled the size of their library,"" said Barbara Gardner, the president of Book Aid. ""The books are small tokens that really help people out."""	4
"One 12-year-old boy gets a ride to school each day from his mom. But he's not on his way to middle school. Instead, he gets dropped off at medical school. Sho Yano (SHOH YAH-noh) is the youngest person to attend medical school at the University of Chicago in Illinois. He plans to graduate around age 19 or 20. That puts him on the path to being one of the youngest people to graduate from medical school. ""I was always interested in science and medicine,"" he told CNN. ""And I also always wanted to help people. And medicine and science seemed like the perfect combination."" This doctor-in-the-making started college at age 9, when most kids his age were in fourth grade. Although he graduated from college three years later, today he still considers himself a regular 12-year-old. He has a pet rabbit and often squabbles with his younger sister."	4
"U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service Several elephants in New Delhi--the capital of that Asian country--have been hit by cars and killed. So a wildlife group has begun fitting the elephants with safety reflectors. The reflectors work like the ones you find on a bike, bouncing back light from oncoming cars. The reflectors are attached to ropes that hang near an elephant's tail and hind legs. In New Delhi, about 30 elephants work at night to help clear fallen trees. Many elephants are also forced to walk in the dark, after working at weddings and other religious festivals late at night. The elephants' dark skin makes it difficult for drivers to see them in the evening. A wildlife group expert said, ""Most of India's 5,000 working elephants will soon [be wearing reflectors]."" That's a safe move!"	4
"The flag people call the Star-Spangled Banner survived a fierce battle in 1814. Today, it lies flat like a patient on an operating table. Time, dust, and light have damaged it. Though it is frayed and torn in spots, after three years of care, the old flag is near recovery. A team of experts at the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C., has been cleaning the flag. The museum's goal is not to make the flag look new but to protect it and save its place in history. The flag experts haven't been working on the national symbol behind closed doors. Museum visitors have been able to watch experts work on the flag through a glass wall. The Star-Spangled Banner is too fragile, or delicate, to be hung up. Marilyn Zoidis, a museum official, told Weekly Reader that the flag will be placed in a glass room, similar to the one where it is being fixed. The new space will allow experts to continue to care for the flag while it is on display for the public. The temperature and light will be controlled in the room to protect the flag. Zoidis expects the exhibit to be ready in 2006. She said, ""The flag represents the ideals of America-equality and liberty for all."" During the War of 1812, Francis Scott Key wrote the poem that later became the national anthem. That war was fought against Great Britain. On September 13, 1814, Key watched as British troops bombed Fort McHenry in Baltimore, Maryland. The flag flying over the fort survived the night. Key was so moved by the sight of the American flag that he wrote a poem that was later set to music. In 1931, Congress made the song the official national anthem."	4
"The Old Man, of course, wasnâ€™t a person but a rock formation that nature carved out thousands of years ago. With its pointed nose, sharp chin, and heavy forehead, the mountainside looked like the profile of an old manâ€™s face. A profile is a side view of a face. Located on Cannon Mountain, the Old Man was a popular tourist spot and a favorite among the people of New Hampshire. In fact, the jagged rock face was considered the state symbol. It appeared on state quarters, road signs, and many souvenirs. The famous landmark stretched 40 feet high and 25 feet wide. Long concerned that it would collapse, officials made several efforts to save the mountain face. However, the heavy snow and strong winds of this past winter finally caused the cliff to collapse. Now a special state committee has been set up to decide if the stone profile should be replaced with a man-made face. ""He was part of our history, and he can still be a part of our history if we rebuild him,"" said a New Hampshire man who recalled learning about the famous face in the fourth grade. Do you think the Old Man should be rebuilt? Why or why not?"	4
Think zero is a big nothing? Think again! Here is a game where zero can help you win or make you lose! To play, players take turns rolling the die for seven rounds, filling in their charts after each turn. To fill in your chart, write the number rolled in either the tens or the ones column. Put a zero in the other column. Keep track of your running total. For example, if you roll a 6, you can write either: The player whose total is closest to 100, without going over, wins. Be careful! Use the tens column wisely, or you'll go over 100!	4
The babies are receiving constant care at the nature center. They are covered with white hair and weigh 4 to 6 ounces. That's about the size of a hot dog. As the pandas grow, they will develop black hair on their ears and around their eyes. Black hair will also grow across their shoulders and on their legs. The infants offer hope to scientists concerned about pandas, which are endangered. The nature center is home to more than 60 pandas. There are fewer than 1,100 giant pandas left in the wild. Pandas in the wild live in bamboo forests in the mountains of China. The panda's diet consists mainly of bamboo shoots, stems, and leaves. Pandas lose their homes and have less food to eat when people cut down bamboo forests for wood and farmland. In an effort to protect pandas, the government of China has made it illegal to cut down bamboo in certain areas.	4
"A new tennis star has arrived. Andy Roddick claimed his championship trophy in early September. He won his first major tennis tournament at the U.S. Open in New York, defeating Spain's Juan Carlos Ferrero. ""It hasn't sunk in,"" said an emotional Roddick after the match. ""I came to this tournament so many times as a little kid and watched from way up there [in the stands]. Along with his trophy, Roddick accepted a $1 million winning prize. Because of this championship win, Roddick has risen to number two in the tennis rankings, which is a career record for him. However, Ferrero, who won the French Open, still holds the top slot. Last year, Roddick lost the U.S. Open to Sampras. For any who questioned his ability, Roddick proved that he is the new U.S. Open champion."	4
Like China, North and South Korea are countries in Asia. If the Chinese police had found the family, they would have sent them back to their country to be punished or even killed. The brothers, Young Hoon* and Young Jun, and their family members walked, rode in cars, and flew on an airplane to reach South Korea. Their journey took about a year. They were lucky. There are about 200,000 to 300,000 North Koreans now hiding in China. But only about 2,000 of them are expected to make it to South Korea this year. Young Hoon, Young Jun, and their family members risked their lives to reach South Korea. Why? If they had stayed in North Korea, they faced starvation. Many North Korean children are hungry because their families cannot find food. In fact, over the past ten years, about 2 million people in North Korea have starved to death. About a year after their arrival, the brothers tell me they are happy in Seoul, the busy capital city of South Korea. I visited Young Hoon and Young Jun at the Hannuri School, an after-school program for teens who have left North Korea and come to South Korea to start new lives. Teachers at Hannuri help the North Koreans with their schoolwork. Many of the teens did not go to school regularly in North Korea, so they are behind in their lessons. Even though North and South Korea are neighbors, the two countries are very different. North Korea is very poor. Its leader spends most of the country's money on the army, not on food for the people. South Korea is more like the United States. The country has enough food for everyone, and most people drive cars, go to work, and eat at restaurants. Young Hoon, 18, and Young Jun, 15, say that in North Korea they lived in a hut and ate mostly corn and potatoes. In South Korea, their lives are much different. The brothers live in an apartment and eat well. They love movies and video games. North and South Korea are countries in eastern Asia. Korea used to be one country. It was divided in half after World War II (1939--1945). In 1950, North Korea invaded South Korea, starting the Korean War (1950--1953). After the Korean War, the Demilitarized Zone, or DMZ, was set up to divide the two countries. I visited the South Korean side of the DMZ. Everywhere I looked there were soldiers. I wasn't allowed to talk to them because they were on duty. Young Jun is already prepared to visit. An American he met on his way to South Korea gave him a U.S. dollar. Despite plenty of opportunities to spend the money in South Korea, Young Jun has kept it. After all, he tells me, he's going to need it when he gets to the United States.	4
The change comes after recent trade talks between the United States and Singapore. The new policy has a couple of catches. Gum can be sold only in pharmacies, and it must have dentistsâ€™ seal of approval. Why did Singapore stop the sale of gum in previous years? Singapore is known for its extreme cleanliness. In 1992, the country stopped the sale of chewing gum because people were leaving gooey wads on sidewalks, buildings, buses, and subways. How gross is that?	4
"On the first day of school, Rand said, her classmates ripped out pictures of Saddam Hussein from their textbooks. Saddam is the former president of Iraq. The students tossed the pages out the window, yelling ""Bye, bye, Saddam."" That was not an unusual sight at some schools throughout this war-torn country. Saddam's government was toppled in April. At that time, U.S.-led forces took control of Baghdad, the capital of Iraq. During Saddam's rule, teachers were forced to mention him in every lesson, from history to music to gym class. Students even learned math by adding 4 + 28. That's because April 28 is Saddam's birthday. Now schools are erasing Saddam's image and teachings from their lessons. Iraqi officials are rewriting the country's textbooks. That will give students the opportunity to learn new ideas about the world. The new textbooks, which will arrive this month, don't include any references praising Saddam. Pictures of Saddam have been removed from classrooms. Students are no longer forced to chant ""Long live our leader, Saddam"" during their classes. Despite the changes, U.S. soldiers report that many of Iraq's schools are in various states of disrepair, or poor condition. Although many schools were failing before the war began, many more schools were destroyed or seriously damaged during the fighting. Some schools have broken windows and doors and are still without electricity or running water. Some lack chalkboards, desks, and other much-needed furniture and supplies. The good news is that help is on the way for teachers and students. U.S. soldiers and aid groups are helping rebuild many of the run-down schools, restoring water and electricity. They are also providing children with school supplies that Americans have donated. One 9-year-old Iraqi student was all smiles as soldiers unloaded boxes of new crayons, markers, book bags, and other donated supplies. Despite the challenges, the new school year offers a fresh start for many teachers and children. ""Memories of the war are still fresh, but we shall go past that,"" said one teacher in Iraq. ""[The students] will be safer now."" A fourth-grade class in Maine is reaching out to schoolchildren in Iraq. The students are collecting notebooks, colored pencils, rulers, and other supplies to send to Iraq. Nine-year-old Jaden Dickinson told Weekly Reader that he hopes the care packages will improve the lives of schoolchildren in Iraq. His classmate Maddie Brochu feels the same way. ""They don't have very much at their schools,"" she said. The project is close to their teacher's heart. Barbara Winslow's two sons serve in the U.S. military in Baghdad. Winslow told Weekly Reader that donating the supplies helps her students make a personal connection with children in another culture."	4

The picture of Andrew Jackson, who was the seventh president of the United States, will stay on the bill. However, the oval around him will no longer appear on the bill. Government officials say the new design features were added to help stop illegal counterfeit, or fake, money. Within the United States, there are more fake copies of the $20 bill than of any other bill. The Bureau of Engraving and Printing makes all U.S. paper money. It is part of the U.S. Treasury Department. The U.S. government first printed paper money in 1862.	4
Scientists are trying to solve a mystery: Where is Christopher Columbus buried? The Dominican Republic-an island in Central America-also claims to have the remains of this famous explorer. In 1492, Columbus set sail from Spain and arrived in North America. He made four trips altogether. Before he died in 1506, he asked to be buried on the island that is today the Dominican Republic. It is part of the area he explored on his third and fourth trips. When Spain lost control of the island, his body was moved. Spanish officials think it was taken to the island of Cuba before possibly being moved back to Spain. However, the Dominican Republic says the Spanish travelers took the wrong remains. By testing the bones, Spanish scientists hope to get to the truth of the matter.	4
Did you ever open a bag of cookies and wonder why they were broken into so many pieces? Scientists now know why. Contrary to popular belief, it has nothing to do with the way the cookies were packaged, loaded on shelves, or transported from the store to your home. According to scientists in England, cookies pick up moisture as they cool after coming out of the oven. The moisture causes the cookies to expand and contract, which results in cracks. The cracks cause cookies to easily break when they're moved or packaged. Bakers can use that information to adjust the temperature during the cooling process. Scientists hope the discovery will help keep cookies from crumbling during normal handling.	4
"Josh Kay knows a thing or two about making a joke. The 10-year-old recently went onstage at a comedy club in New York City. He did a short standup routine that had the crowd howling. The fifth grader was so funny that he won the Bazooka Joe Wisecracking Kid Contest. He beat 11 other finalists and won a year's supply of Bazooka Bubble Gum and a $5,000 savings bond. Even cooler is that Josh will get his name and one of his jokes printed on a Bazooka Joe comic strip. A cartoonist will also sketch a humorous picture, called a caricature, of Josh to include on the comic strip. The contest celebrated the 50th birthday of Bazooka Joe. He's that eye patch-wearing kid whose jokes come wrapped around pieces of bubble gum. ""I don't really do jokes; I do impressions,"" Josh told Weekly Reader. Josh did a good impression of Darth Vader from Star Wars. ""A three-legged dog walks into a saloon. He tells the people, 'I'm looking for the man who shot my paw.' """	4
"When you think of a museum, what comes to mind? You may think of science and art, but what about PEZ? That's right, PEZ, the bite-size candies that fit neatly inside colorful dispensers. A new PEZ museum recently opened in Easton, Pennsylvania. It's the third PEZ museum in the country to display the famous candy dispensers. If you're looking for a popular character, chances are you'll find it here! The museum is home to 1,500 PEZ dispensers, from SpongeBob SquarePants and Charlie Brown to Garfield and Santa Claus. In addition, Disney-themed PEZ dispensers are displayed in a 10-foot-high castle. Visitors can even play a ""Where in the World Is Waldo?"" game on a wall display of more than 500 dispensers. The museum also has some rare PEZ dispensers that are very valuable. A baseball bat, ball, and glove PEZ dispenser from the 1960s sells for about $400! Many children and adults get excited over the plastic PEZ dispensers. ""For me it combines the two favorite elements of childhood... toys and candy,"" said Jill Cohen, an adult PEZ collector. According to the Connecticut company that makes PEZ, Americans consume a lot of the tiny candy. More than 3 billion PEZ candies are eaten each year in the United States! The candy traces its roots back to 1927. It was invented in the European country of Austria as a mint to help people quit smoking. So how exactly did the candy get its name? PEZ is derived from the word pfefferminz, which is German for peppermint."	4
"One Missouri family finished a yearlong history lesson. The family visited all 50 capitol buildings in the United States. Fred and Ginger Gall and their three sons--ages 13, 11, and 6--wrapped up their adventure in early August. Their final stop was at their home state's capitol building in St. Louis. It took them a little more than a year to complete their journey, covering a total of 48,000 square miles. They traveled across the country in a mobile home. Although the kids attend school in Missouri, they were home-schooled during their trip. Their parents said the trip was a chance to teach their sons about the history of the United States. As part of their schooling, the kids used their textbooks from their school. They had many field trips to add to the mix. In addition to visiting all the capitol buildings, the family stopped at science and history museums and national parks along the way. What sent them packing? ""Our friends from another country had seen more of [the United States] than we had,"" said Ginger Gall. ""There was something wrong with that picture."""	4
A new sports car is making waves. With the touch of a button, this convertible turns into a boat. It recently went for a test-drive, jetting along the Thames River in London, the capital of England. Named the Aquada, the car can reach speeds of 100 miles per hour on land and about 30 miles per hour on water. The wheels pull into the car as soon as it hits water. To avoid leaks, the car has no doors. Like a boat, the car requires drivers and passengers to climb over the side to get into it. The new cars aren't cheap. One hundred are being built and will sell for $235,000 each at the end of the year.	4
Did you know that for a lot of people, their foot is the same length as their forearm? True for you? Let's measure! Now use the string to measure these body parts. Have a friend help. Be sure to measure from one black mark on the string to the next. A person's height is often the same as his or her arm span (arms out to side, middle fingertip to middle fingertip). Is yours?	4
Hunter ran into the house to tell his father about the 8 1 / 2-inch reptile. Reptiles, like this snake, are cold-blooded animals that either crawl around on the ground or, like turtles and lizards, creep on short legs. One scientist said that Hunter's find was very rare. Only about one of every 10,000 snakes has two heads!	4
Some people consider the toothbrush one of the most important inventions. Today, we take brushing and flossing for granted, but can you imagine what your life would be like without a toothbrush? Tooth Truths! Anyone who's ever had a toothache will tell you that it can be very painful. Since ancient times, humans have tried different ways to stop the rot. Here are a few: Mighty Mouse Ancient Egyptians placed a live mouse on a person's gums to relieve a toothache. They believed mice could cure toothaches because the rodents have good teeth. Scientists think the ancient tool served double duty. They believe that people used the tiny spoon to clean their ears! The bristles were probably hog hairs. Although the toothbrush has been around for several hundred years, people have been caring for their teeth since ancient times. In fact, some scientists say that ancient Egyptians used stalks of grass to clean their teeth. They also believe that people long ago used tooth powders made of charcoal to clean their teeth.	4
"There are cameras almost everywhere. They watch us in banks and in stores and when we're riding in cars. They watch us at concerts and at sporting events. On reality TV, video cameras follow celebrities and ordinary people as they go about their lives. Now cameras are even popping up in public schools. Students in Biloxi, Mississippi, have found themselves under the watchful eye of Web cameras. Their school district is one of the first in the country to have cameras located in all public-school classrooms. The school superintendent says that the use of cameras helps make sure students behave and prevents crime. The cameras, which don't record sound, are not open to public viewing. Before watching the class on computers, officials are required to enter a password. Parents, teachers, and students would need court permission to watch. Many teachers and students say they feel safer with cameras and are pleased to have them in the classrooms. Others say they don't feel the same way. They are concerned that Web cameras may interfere with teaching and distract students from learning. They also point out that the use of cameras is an invasion of privacy. But the superintendent told USA Today the cameras have been placed in classrooms for safety purposes. The cameras are meant for ""supervision, not snoopervision,"" he said."	4
"When I stepped inside the old Mission Control room at the Johnson Space Center in Houston, I felt like a kid again. Even though the computers had long been shut off, I knew I was experiencing a piece of history. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) used this control room when the United States first sent humans to the moon. The room also served as the center for dozens of other space missions. The Gemini missions took place in the mid-1960s. Their goal was to prepare humans to land on the moon. My tour brought back many memories. I remember watching Neil Armstrong take ""one giant leap for mankind"" on my parent's television. In 1969, Armstrong became the first person to walk on the moon. A year later, I was glued to the television again. This time, scientists in this very room were trying to figure out how to get the astronauts of Apollo 13 back home when an oxygen tank exploded aboard their craft. In the same building as the old Mission Control room is the new Mission Control room. Here, scientists keep tabs on the International Space Station (ISS) that orbits above Earth. When I was a kid, I dreamed of walking on the moon. Walk-ing through Johnson Space Center--some 30 years later--is the next best thing. 1. The Saturn V rocket used to launch astronauts to the moon is located outside Johnson Space Center in Houston. 2. In 1965, the Gemini 7 spacecraft makes its historic mission. 3. Sixteen countries, including the United States, are building the International Space Station."	4
Candidates running for the presidency aren't the only people in the spotlight. Some of their wives are helping them on the campaign trail. They are making public appearances, talking about important issues, and supporting their husbands' presidential run. Beginning with Martha Washington, first ladies have been an important part of American history. Women's History Month is a fitting time to celebrate the achievements of some of those public figures. Take a look at a few.	4
Investigators say both people and nature were to blame for the fires. The fires spread rapidly because of the Santa Ana winds, which blow hot, dry air from the desert. Cold and rainy weather eventually rolled in to help quench the flames. About 15,000 firefighters battled flames that were out of control. Thousands of people had to quickly evacuate, or leave, their homes to escape the fire's destructive path. Many families lost their homes and belongings in the fires. At least 22 people died as a result of the fires. President Bush declared several southern California counties disaster areas. Governor-elect Arnold Schwarzenegger will work with officials to help homeowners and businesses rebuild. Government officials say the wildfires will be California's most expensive natural disaster. They estimate rebuilding efforts will cost more than $2 billion.	4
"The theme of this year's Fire Prevention Week is ""When Fire Strikes: Get Out! Stay Out!"" For the past 81 years, the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) has used Fire Prevention Week to teach people how to prevent fires and how to protect themselves all year long. The NFPA has the following safety tips for you and your family:"	4
"1. Max 2. Sam 3. Lady 4. Bear 5. Smokey 6. Shadow 7. Kitty 8. Molly 9. Buddy 10. Brandy According to the National Research Council, one out of every four cats and dogs in the United States weighs too much. How did these animals get so plump? Many of their owners overfeed them. Like people, overweight cats and dogs have a greater risk of developing heart disease and other health conditions. The clue for determining whether a pet is overweight is in the ribs. ""If you can feel the ribs under your pet's skin but not see them, your pet is a perfect weight,"" animal expert Karen Volkerts told Weekly Reader. Owners can help their plump pups and fat cats shed some extra pounds. Animal experts recommend feeding pudgy pets smaller portions, reducing their number of feedings, and using diet pet food. Regular exercise will also help pets trim down and stay healthy. Many owners reward their pets or show them affection by giving them table scraps and other treats. Volkerts says that dogs and cats have their own food for a reason. ""They aren't able to digest human food,"" she said. What should people do who want to spoil their pets? ""Play with them,"" she said."	4
"Many people can learn a lesson in good sportsmanship from a Florida Little League team. After losing the Little League World Series to Japan in late August, Florida players didn't sulk. Instead, they were all smiles as they joined Japan's players at the end of the game to celebrate. ""We're number one in the United States, and that's fine with me,"" one Florida player told the Sun Sentinel newspaper. ""I felt happy for them,"" he said, referring to the players from the winning team. A team from Japan has won the Little League World Series three times in the last five years. This year, a team from Tokyo beat Boynton Beach, Florida, 10-1. The championship game was played in Pennsylvania in front of 41,000 stadium fans. Neither team scored until the fourth inning when Japan brought home eight runs, which included a grand slam. A grand slam is when a batter hits a home run with the bases loaded. Florida scored its first, and only, run in the fifth inning. Boynton Beach was one of eight teams from Florida to make it to the Little League World Series. However, no Florida team has won the title game yet."	4
On February 1, the Super Bowl will be played in Texas for only the second time, at Reliant Stadium, home of the Houston Texans. It's the only professional football stadium with a retractable roof-one that opens and closes.	4
Nine-year-old Akiane (ah-KEE-ah-nah) Kramarik has an amazing gift for painting and poetry. She is only in the fourth grade, but already her paintings have sold between $7,000 and $30,000 apiece. The young artist from Idaho often writes poems to accompany her paintings. She has a book of poems coming out later this year. For National Poetry Month, which is celebrated in April, Weekly Reader (WR) spoke with Akiane about her talents. Here is what she had to say: Akiane: I was almost 4 when I became interested in art. I started writing poetry when I was 6. Akiane: They come to me in my dreams. I get up at 5 o'clock every morning to work on my paintings and write poetry. WR: What do you enjoy most about painting? about poetry? Akiane: The colors! They're so beautiful. My poems explain the paintings. Akiane: It's really easy--just look at what's going on around you and concentrate on your feelings. Write how you feel.	4
"Those celebrities are part of the rapidly growing Hispanic American population in the United States. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, Hispanic Americans now make up the largest minority group in the country. A census is an official count of people. Hispanic Americans are people whose families came to the United States from Spanish-speaking countries. Those parts of the world include Spain, Mexico, Cuba, Puerto Rico, and most countries in Central America and South America. In the United States, many Hispanic Americans are also called Latinos. As of June, about 39 million Hispanic Americans are living in the United States. That number marks a jump from the 2000 census count. At that time, Hispanic Americans numbered about 35 million. Today, the total population of the United States is estimated at more than 288 million people. Currently, 1 out of every 6 kids in this country is Hispanic. Officials estimate that by 2020, 1 out of 4 children will be Hispanic American. Hispanic Americans have influenced food, music, and customs in the United States. Hispanic Heritage Month marks a time for Americans to celebrate the traditions and history of Hispanic people. It takes place from September 15 to October 15. People in communities around the country will celebrate the month with festivals. Many students will recognize the month by learning about the important roles Hispanic people have played in our countryâ€™s history. People sometimes refer to the United States as a ""melting pot."" That phrase means that people from many different countries have settled here. People of Hispanic heritage, along with people from other cultures, help make the United States strong. From science to sports, people of Hispanic heritage have contributed to the history of the United States. Take a look at some of these well-known people. Gary Soto (1952- ) Author Gary Soto is an award-winning Hispanic American author. He writes fiction and poetry for adults and children. His writing is based on his experiences growing up as a Mexican American in California. His books, including Baseball in April and Other Stories and Taking Sides, are popular with many young readers. Ellen Ochoa (1958- ) Astronaut In 1990, Ellen Ochoa became the first Hispanic American woman astronaut when she was accepted into NASAâ€™s training program. Ochoa, whose fatherâ€™s parents were from Mexico, flew her first space shuttle mission in 1993. Since then she has clocked more than 720 hours in flight."	4

Watch out, Spider-Man. You may soon have company. The superhero's powers might someday become more than comic-book science fiction. Researchers from England say that people may actually be able to scale walls and climb ceilings with gloves made of a special material. However, the researchers who came up with the material didn't get the idea from wall-crawling spiders. What's the secret behind their amazing grip? Geckos have millions of tiny hairs on the bottom of their feet. When a gecko comes in contact with a surface, the hairs create an electrical force that lets it cling to a wall or a ceiling. Scientists hope the material can be used with robots or in medicine. But they have a way to go before turning their idea into reality. The material is expensive, and it quickly loses its stickiness. Spider-Man would not be pleased to hear that!	4
The U.S. Mint is pinning two new tails on the nickel. After 65 years, this coin is getting an updated look. The heads side will continue to feature the image of Thomas Jefferson, the third president of the United States. His Monticello home in Virginia will be removed from the tails side of the coin for the next three years. In its place will be two new designs. They will celebrate the 200th anniversary, or bicentennial, of two important events that took place during Jefferson's time in office. Those events are the Louisiana Purchase and Lewis and Clark's expedition. The first coin rolls out in the spring and marks the Louisiana Purchase. In 1803, Jefferson purchased land from France. The second coin will debut in the fall. It honors explorers Lewis and Clark and their 1804-1806 trip west to the Pacific coast of the United States.	4
"Bludge? Funplex? Phat? Do you know what these words mean? If not, you can now look them up in the dictionary. Those terms are among the 10,000 new words and phrases added to the latest edition of Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary. The dictionary was last updated ten years ago. The new version of the dictionary includes 225,000 definitions. The new words added are ""a reflection of society's changes,"" said John Morse, the head of the company that produces the dictionary. The Internet has had a big effect on language. Dot-commer-a person who works for an online company-was one of the new words added. Deciding which words make the cut is the job of editors. They spend a lot of their day reading newspapers and magazines to find out what new words and phrases are popular. They also get ideas from the movies and the Internet-and even from slang usage. They enter new words into a computer system. Noah Webster, America's first dictionary editor, began a similar system. He started putting files of words on cards in Springfield, Massachusetts. There are now millions of words on file. Talk about wordy!"	4
"History is getting ready to repeat itself. This summer, the Olympic Games will return to their birthplace--Greece. This year's Summer Olympics will take place from August 13 through August 29 in Athens, the capital of Greece. The Summer Games are held every four years. The Olympic Games date back more than 2,700 years. They were first held in Olympia, an area west of Athens. The first known Olympic competition included just one event-a 200-yard footrace. Winning athletes were crowned with a wreath of olive leaves. As times changed, the Olympics evolved. In 1896, the first modern Olympic Games began in Athens. At that time, 312 athletes from 13 countries competed in nine sports. Now, more than a century later, 10,500 athletes from more than 200 countries will go for the gold. The athletes will compete in 28 events, including baseball, gymnastics, swimming, and tennis. Since 1896, the Olympic Games have journeyed around the world and have been hosted by, or held in, many cities. In keeping with tradition, the Olympic torch was ignited, or lit, this March in an ancient stadium in Olympia. This year marks the first global, or worldwide, Olympic Torch Relay. It is the first time in history that the Olympic torch will journey through all continents except Antarctica. The torch will travel nearly 48,000 miles before reaching the opening ceremonies in Athens. As runners carry the torch around the world, people in Athens are having a race of their own. They are busy preparing for the estimated 5.3 million spectators, or viewers, who are expected to flood the city in August. Construction workers are feverishly working to finish building the venues. Those are the places where Olympic athletes will compete in different events. At press time, the roof still had to be put on the Olympic Stadium. That is the site where the opening and closing ceremonies will be held. It is also where track-and-field events will take place. Around the rest of the city, workers are completing a railway system and tearing up narrow roads to widen them for traffic. Hotels and restaurants are getting ready for an influx of tourists. Topping the Olympic planners' list is making sure the city is secure for athletes and visitors. Some people are concerned that Athens might not be ready for the Olympics. But the Greek government was quick to reassure: ""We will have everything ready when it matters. We will offer what the world expects of us."""	4
Imagine getting to star alongside Bugs Bunny, Daffy Duck, and the rest of the Looney Toons gang. Actor Brendan Fraser got that chance! Fraser, known for his roles in The Mummy and George of the Jungle, joins Bugs and Daffy on a wild adventure in the upcoming movie Looney Toons: Back in Action. The film hits theaters nationwide on November 14. Weekly Reader caught up with Fraser to ask him about starring in a movie with the famous cartoon characters: Brendan Fraser (BF): To star alongside such greats as Bugs Bunny and the whole cast of toons was an easy decision. But don't tell Daffy. It will go to his head! BF: Every Saturday morning! I used to get sent to the principal's office for doing my impression of the Tasmanian Devil in class. Now the director let me do Taz in the movie. Aaaah, revenge is sweet! BF: Having to imagine that you're in a cartoon world is no easy task. I loved the challenge of believing I was alongside the characters each day.	4
"U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service Griswold, who is a radio traffic reporter by day, runs a ""bat hospital"" in her Connecticut home. While you wonâ€™t find these little creatures stretched out on hospital beds, you might find one or two of them snuggling up to Griswold. At her home, Griswold cares for bats that are sick, injured, or orphaned. She has taken care of bats with injuries, such as a broken wing, as well as babies that have lost their mothers. She has also cared for bats that were stranded in the winter because they had forgotten to travel south during the colder months. With the help of a veterinarian, or animal doctor, Griswold helps nurse the winged mammals back to health. Then she sets them free. But Griswold is no stranger to bats. She grew up on a farm where they were a common sight. So it was no surprise how quickly she took to an orphaned baby bat she found squeaking on the ground outside her house ten years ago. She took the bat in and fed it milk from a goat on her farm. To her delight, the little creature survived the night. Today, the bat--which she named Poppy--still lives with her. She did not release Poppy back into the wild because it identifies more with humans than with bats. This bat lady, however, doesnâ€™t keep Poppy all to herself. Poppy is one of the winged creatures that Griswold brings with her on school visits. In fact, this Halloween she is speaking at a Connecticut school. Griswold, who teaches kids about bats, is on a mission to change their reputation. ""Bats are so misunderstood,"" she told Weekly Reader. Many people, she says, are afraid of bats, but theyâ€™re actually gentle, shy creatures that are important to the environment. Bats pollinate plants, spread seeds, and, most important, eat insects. ""There is no animal worldwide that eats more bugs at night than bats do,"" said Griswold, who is full of bat trivia. However, the number of bats worldwide is in serious decline. They often lose their homes when people cut down trees. But Griswoldâ€™s message seems to be spreading. After she spoke to a Brownie troop, the members built bat houses in their town. The project turned into a community effort. ""The kids are making such a huge difference,"" she said. There are almost a thousand species of bats worldwide. Bats come in different colors, shapes, and sizes. Some have huge ears and unusual faces. In fact, a batâ€™s face can teach you about its habits. Read on about some of these creatures. Vampire bats can be found in Mexico, Central America, and South America. They drink blood, but itâ€™s usually from cattle and horses--not people. A heat sensor on its nose helps it find blood close to the surface of its victimâ€™s skin. Egyptian fruit bats live mainly in Asia and Africa. They eat fruit and nectar. Their long noses help them locate ripe fruit. Fruit bats use their sharp teeth to chew fruit. This batâ€™s ears are almost as long as its head and body. It uses its ears to detect insects. This bat, which is found in parts of North America, feeds mainly on moths."	4
"There have been a lot of empty desks in schools across the United States this winter. Many kids have stayed home while sick with the flu bug that is raging across the country. Chances are if the flu hasn't made you sick yet, it has infected someone you know. Experts say the flu season struck more than a month earlier than its normal start. It began in October and spread quickly. Flu season typically runs from December through April. ""Most of us are convinced this was a hard flu season on children,"" said one flu expert. Hospitals and doctors' offices have been jammed with sick patients, especially kids. Some schools even closed because the flu outbreak was so severe. The flu, which is short for influenza (in-floo-EN-zah), is an infection caused by a virus. Viruses are tiny organisms that invade cells in the body and multiply. A virus is so small that you would need a really strong microscope to see it. Unlike a cold, the flu usually strikes suddenly and without warning. Some symptoms, or signs, of the flu include fever, muscle aches, and a cough. Someone who has the flu virus can easily infect other people. The flu is highly contagious. That means it can be passed from person to person. The flu virus spreads through the air when an infected person sneezes or coughs. Other people can catch the flu by breathing in the airborne germs. Although there is no cure for the flu, health experts say that getting a vaccine (VAK-seen) can help protect people from becoming sick. A vaccine is a substance that fights the flu virus. This season, many people lined up to get the vaccine in the form of flu shots. Each year, the flu virus changes. Scientists develop a vaccine to protect people from the type of virus that is spreading. Although the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention warns that ""there's still plenty of flu out there,"" this organization has some good news. It reports that the number of flu cases appears to be on the decline. At press time, health officials say only five states report that the flu is widespread. That number is down from 45 at the flu's peak, or highest point, in December. Now, that's something to feel better about! Kids often get the flu because they are in close contact with one another at school. ""If you get the flu, don't panic,"" advises Dr. Carol Baker, of Houston, Texas. ""Most kids will recover just fine."" To help you get better, follow these tips that"	4
"At the time, about 50,000 grizzly bears roamed the West. But as pioneers moved westward, the number of grizzly bears began to shrink. Illegal hunting, trapping, and habitat loss were to blame for the bears' disappearance. A habitat is the place in nature where an animal makes its home. Today, there are only 800 to 1,000 grizzlies remaining in the lower 48 states, but there is hope for these creatures. About 550 of the grizzlies live in the Yellowstone National Park area in Wyoming, Idaho, and Montana. That is almost double the number that lived there in the 1980s. Thanks to the Endangered Species Act of 1973, the grizzly is making a comeback. Congress passed the act to protect animals that were in danger of becoming extinct. Wildlife officials hope to remove grizzly bears in the Yellowstone National Park area from the endangered species list within the next year. Steven Williams, the director of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, told USA Today that the change is ""a tribute to the American people's commitment to wildlife [protection]."""	4
Noel Daniels found the strange-looking reptile in his backyard. It had hatched from an egg laid by one of his seven pet tortoises. According to Daniels, the underside of the two-headed tortoise's shell is flat. Usually, it is rounded. In other ways, Daniels said, the tortoise appears to be normal. However, there is some confusion when the tortoise gets frightened. Each head seems to want to move in its own direction. The tortoise will live in Daniels's backyard. Unlike turtles, tortoises are land animals. One tortoise expert predicts that the animal's odds of surviving are greater in Daniels's backyard than they would be in the wild.	4
"Steven's mother knew what to do but couldn't tell her kids or call 911 because she couldn't talk. Luckily, Steven knew how to handle the situation and ran to his mother's rescue. The 9-year-old had read about the Heimlich (HIGHM-lik) maneuver in an issue of Weekly Reader last spring. The Heimlich maneuver is an emergency action that can save the life of a person who is choking. Standing behind his mother, Steven wrapped his arms around her stomach, pushed up, and helped dislodge the piece of food that was stuck. ""It's amazing that he learned it from reading a diagram that appeared in Weekly Reader,"" said his mother. ""That information really helped me out."" 1. Stand behind the choking person and wrap your arms around his or her waist. 2. Make a fist and hold it against the person's stomach, about halfway between the belly button and the rib cage. 3. Grab your fist with your other hand. Press it in with an upward thrust. Repeat until the person stops choking."	4
"Playing the flute or the tuba--or any instrument, for that matter--helps students perform better in school. Scientists in China studied a group of kids from age 6 to age 15. They discovered that students who took music lessons were able to remember more words. What's the link between music and memory? The skills for learning music and remembering words develop in the same part of the brain. The study's researchers also say the effects are long-lasting. That means kids who stop playing an instrument will continue to have improved vocabulary skills. ""Students with better verbal memory probably will find it easier to learn in school,"" said one researcher. But she's quick to point out that good memory alone doesn't lead to success at school. ""[Students] need to work hard,"" she said."	4
"King lived in the house from 1954 to 1960. During those years, he became one of the leaders of the civil rights movement. When King was growing up in the South, African Americans were not allowed to go to the same schools as white people. They were also forced to use separate restrooms and drinking fountains and had to sit in the back seats of public buses. They boycotted, or refused to ride, the buses. As a result of the boycott, the law was changed to provide people with equal seating on public buses. The success of the boycott led King to national fame. He continued to work for equality, drawing huge crowds to hear his powerful speeches. In August 1963, King gave his famous ""I Have a Dream"" speech on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial in Washington, D.C., before more than 200,000 people. The restoration of King's house is just in time for Martin Luther King Jr. Day, which is celebrated this year on January 19. It's more than just a day off from school for many students. To honor King's dedication to helping others, many kids will participate in community service projects. As King once said, ""Everybody can be great because everybody can serve."""	4
"According to the Pentagon, 150,000 American troops served in the war against Iraq, and 130,000 troops remain overseas. The Pentagon houses the four branches of the U.S. military, which include the Army, Marines, Navy, and Air Force. On November 11, many ceremonies will take place to thank the members of the U.S. military who helped remove Saddam Hussein from power. They will also remember veterans who served in other U.S. wars. Master Sergeant Emma Krouser served in the 3rd Infantry Division that led the assault on Baghdad. She described her experience in Iraq this summer. ""The people were waving flags... and giving soldiers the thumbs-up sign,"" Krouser told Weekly Reader. ""It really made me appreciate the freedoms we take for granted in this country."""	4
March Madness has begun! That is the time in college basketball, from the beginning of March to the beginning of April, when top-rated teams compete to become national champions. During March Madness, 65 men's teams and 64 women's teams are narrowed down to the Final Four. The two winning teams from each Final Four compete in the NCAA (National College Athletic Association) championship game. Last year, Syracuse University brought home the winning trophy for the men, and the University of Connecticut won the women's trophy. Which teams will make their schools proud this year?	4
A squirrel named Twiggy has a talent that might make its rodent friends jealous. Here, Twiggy, the world's only water-skiing squirrel, makes a splash at a boat show in Tulsa, Oklahoma. Twiggy skims across a pool, pulled behind a remote-controlled boat operated by the squirrel's trainer. Squirrels are related to beavers, mice, and rats.	4
"One polar bear spent part of the summer feeling a bit off-color. The 14-year-old bearâ€™s snowy white fur briefly turned purple after she was given medicine to treat a skin problem. The bear, named Pelusa, lives at a zoo in Argentina--a country in South America. When Pelusa changed shades, visitors flocked to the zoo to see her purple coat. That must have been a ""berry"" strange site!"	4
Neither will one Pennsylvania family. They were stranded on a roller coaster in Ohio when the ride came to a grinding halt. Amusement-park employees helped them safely walk down the track. August 14 marked the date of the worst blackout in U.S. history. From Michigan to New York to parts of Canada, 50 million people found themselves without electricity. A shutdown in the nation's power grid was to blame. The power grid is the system that controls the country's flow of electricity. The electricity was out for 48 hours in many places. Officials are investigating what caused the power failure. As Weekly Reader went to press, officials said a power failure near Cleveland, Ohio, was the start of the problem. From there, the blackout raced through the northeast parts of the country, much like falling dominoes. A backup alarm system failed. The United States and Canada formed a task force to make sure another widespread blackout doesn't happen. Preventing a repeat blackout involves fixing the way electricity flows through the power grid. Some people want the government to spend more money on additional, stronger power lines and newer equipment.	4
"Isabel packed winds of up to 100 miles per hour by the time it hit land. The storm walloped the coasts of North Carolina and Virginia and then moved inland. The hurricane caused massive flooding and damage. More than 4.5 million people lost electricity. At least 40 deaths were blamed on the storm. Despite the devastation, Isabel could have been worse. Thanks to the work of Hurricane Hunters, weather forecasters accurately predicted the stormâ€™s path. Many people received warning and fled, or evacuated, their homes. Hurricane Hunters are a special part of the Air Force. They found out how dangerous Isabel was before it battered the coast. The experienced fliers and scientists gathered information about the size, strength, and path of Isabel. They sent that information to forecasters at the National Hurricane Center in Florida. The information led officials to evacuate shoreline areas in North Carolina and Virginia. The federal government in Washington, D.C., also shut down. Hurricane Hunters fly directly into the eye of a hurricane--not above it. The reason is that a hurricane can extend more than 50,000 feet high, and these planes can fly only as high as 30,000 feet. As the plane ""punched through"" the eye wall of Isabel, crew members experienced a rocky ride. The eye wall is a solid ring of thunderstorms around the eye. The strongest winds and heaviest rains are located here. The plane contains equipment that records weather. In the eye of the storm, Hurricane Hunters released small tubes attached to parachutes. Each tube was about the size of a can of tennis balls. The tubes sent information about wind speed, power, and moisture back to the crew. As part of their job, Hurricane Hunters help forecasters rate storms. Hurricanes are rated on a scale of 1 to 5. A stormâ€™s rating is based on wind speed and potential for damage. Before hitting land, Isabel was a Category-5 storm. That is the most powerful type. Satellites in space and other weather instruments are used to measure hurricanes. However, forecasters say that Hurricane Hunters provide the most accurate prediction of the path and strength of a hurricane. Hurricanes are rated on a scale of 1 to 5. The ratings are based on the stormâ€™s wind and potential for destruction."	4
"In June, a small car pulled up outside the Iraqi National Museum in Baghdad. Three men unloaded a wrapped object from the trunk, handed it to museum officials, and sped off in the mid afternoon heat. No questions asked. Museum officials were stunned. The men had left a very important vase. Although the vase was in pieces, the good news was that it could be fixed. ""This is one of the most important pieces from the Baghdad museum, and I am delighted it has been returned,"" said a museum official. ""It is reason for people all around the world to celebrate."" Why, exactly, would the return of a vase be cause for celebration? It was the famous Vase of Warka. The 5,000-year-old artifact, or man-made object, is one of the world's first sculptures. The images on the vase are important because they link the past to modern times. At that time, mobs of thieves and rioters, or looters, tore through the museum. They smashed ancient objects. Thieves ran off with prized treasures. Among the lost objects were carvings, jewelry, paintings, and statues. One museum official referred to the looting as the ""crime of the century."" He said that it wasn't just a loss for Iraq, but that it was ""a loss for all mankind."" The shattered and stolen objects were priceless. That means they could never be replaced. Some of the lost objects dated back 10,000 years, to the beginning of civilization. Many people blamed U.S. troops for failing to protect the museum as Saddam's government fell. They pointed out that U.S. forces had managed to guard the oil reserves. U.S. government officials defended themselves, saying that American troops were focused on taking control of Baghdad. Officials estimate that about 3,000 pieces from the museum's entire collection of 170,000 items are still missing. The losses were not as large as experts originally thought. Some valuable pieces were hidden in underground vaults. Other pieces were taken by people for safekeeping and then were returned. Some of the stolen objects are slowly making their way back to the museum. Museum workers are trying to ensure the safe return of other objects. They began a ""don't ask; don't tell"" policy. The policy allows thieves-like the ones who brought back the vase-to return stolen goods without punishment. Countries around the world are involved in recovery efforts. They are helping to compile a list of the stolen items. However, as one expert pointed out, ""It's going to be a long time before we know for sure what's missing."" Modern-day Iraq is the site of ancient Mesopotamia. In Greek, Mesopotamia means ""the land between rivers."" There, about 5,000 years ago, the first cities sprang up between the Tigris and Euphrates rivers. The area between the two rivers is often referred to as a cradle of civilization. That's because mathematics, science, and one of the first written languages developed there. This life-size marble head of a woman is one of the earliest pieces of sculpture. About 5,000 years old, it was stolen during the looting."	4
It's not just vending machines that are getting a makeover. In a move to make cafeteria food more healthful, New York City schools will also cut the amount of sugar, fat, and salt in school lunches. That means beef ravioli, potato salad, ice cream, and macaroni and cheese might disappear from lunch trays. Its lunch menus will eventually contain more healthful, low-fat versions of foods such as chicken nuggets and cheese pizza. Starting this fall, vegetables will be offered five days a week. New York City is removing the junk food from its 2,400 school vending machines. Take a peek at what can now be found inside. Moving In School officials in New York City hope the changes will help students make more healthful choices. Other school districts around the country are also making similar changes. Some schools are even removing their vending machines. Many schools use the money from vending machines to pay for sports and other programs. However, health officials say that schools don't need to remove vending machines if they offer more nutritious items in them. Poor diets and lack of exercise have led to an increase in extremely overweight, or obese, kids across the country. Experts say that 15 out of every 100 kids aged 6 to 11 are overweight in the United States. Another study shows that about 20 out of every 100 third graders and 21 out of every 100 sixth graders in New York City are obese. Being overweight can lead to health problems such as diabetes and heart disease.	4
"If you like reading Weekly Reader, you can now catch your favorite periodical on TV. Weekly Reader is part of a new television program called Kids News. Every weekend, kid anchors and reporters deliver news of interest to kids. Weekly Reader works closely with the show's producers, offering ideas and reviewing scripts. The show also includes the results of online polls from Weekly Reader's Web site. Thirteen-year-old Natalie Distler is a reporter on the program. ""Being on TV is very cool, and I'm so excited to have this chance,"" said Natalie. ""Kids News is great because it focuses on issues kids want to see."" The half-hour show, which airs on stations across the country, features current news. It also deals with problems facing kids today, such as childhood obesity. Other segments include interviews with kids on the street, as well as music and movie reviews. Was Natalie nervous the first time she was on the air?

"T. rex roamed the Earth about 85 million to 65 million years ago. Although T. rex is known for its bone-crushing bite, its image as a ferocious killer is up for debate. A new exhibit at a museum in London poses this question: Was T. rex really a killer? New evidence suggests that T. rex might have actually been a scavenger. A scavenger, such as a vulture, feeds on the carcasses, or dead bodies, of other animals. Like a vulture, this dinosaur had a strong sense of smell, which might have led it to scrounge for leftovers. The man behind this theory, or idea, is paleontologist Jack Horner. A paleontologist is a scientist who studies dinosaurs. ""Everything says [T. rex] lived on dead meat,"" said Horner. Why exactly does Horner think this carnivore, or meat eater, fed on carcasses? He says that T. rex, which weighed 7 tons, was too heavy to run fast enough to catch other animals. At 40 feet long, this dinosaur was about the size of a truck. In addition, T. rex had tiny arms, which would have made it difficult for this creature to catch a moving target. According to Horner, there is no evidence that suggests that T. rex was a predator. A predator, such as a lion or a shark, is an animal that hunts other animals for food. Another paleontologist agrees that T. rex was not built for speed. However, she argues that T. rex could have caught slow-moving prey. ""I think it was partly a scavenger and partly a hunter. It could have killed old or weak animals."" The exhibit leaves it up to visitors to judge for themselves. Recently, a show of hands from a group of kids suggested it was likely a combination of killer and scavenger. ""The answer is that we will probably never be certain,"" said Horner. ""But as long as we keep asking the questions, we are serving science."""	4
How about cruising around town in a Hello Kitty cab? If you live in Japan, that's possible. Ten Hello Kitty cabs recently hit the streets outside Tokyo, the capital of this Asian country. The cabs are popular with Hello Kitty fans, who don't have to pay more for their fun ride. The fares are about the same as those for a regular cab ride. The cabs also come equipped with free umbrellas, ponchos, and tissues featuring the cartoon cat. Hello Kitty celebrates her 30th birthday next year. Japan-based Hello Kitty has made her mark around the world, appearing on everything from cabs to cellphone accessories to jewelry.	4
"Visitors can walk past the Liberty Bell in Philadelphia. They can tour the White House in Washington, D.C. But the Statue of Liberty, which stands tall on Liberty Island in New York Harbor, is off-limits. The Statue of Liberty is the only major national landmark that has not reopened since the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. Although the grounds are open, officials say the 305-foot-tall monument is closed because of security and safety concerns. The group that cares for the statue is raising $7 million to make safety improvements so it can reopen. However, there is a possibility that only the pedestal, or base, of the statue will open again. People may never be able to climb the narrow spiral staircase to the crown again. Safety experts say that evacuating people from the crown of the statue in an emergency might be too difficult. The Statue of Liberty is one of the world's most powerful symbols of freedom. Millions of immigrants have passed by it on their way to the United States. Immigrants are people who move to a new country from another country. France gave the Statue of Liberty to the United States. It was a gift to celebrate the friendship between the two countries during the American Revolution (1775-1783). During the Revolutionary War, France helped the United States gain independence from Great Britain. Since 8-year-old Nina Wade moved to New York City from California almost two years ago, the statue has been closed. She hopes to be able to someday walk its steps. ""I would be disappointed if it didn't reopen,"" she told Weekly Reader, ""but it makes me feel good to know that [officials] are taking safety measures."""	4
"This May marks the 50th anniversary of a court case that changed history. That case was Brown v. Board of Education. On May 17, 1954, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that having separate schools for black students and white students violated the U.S. Constitution. In 1951, Linda Brown, a third-grade student in Topeka, Kansas, was one of many African American children forced to attend black-only schools. Even though the school for white students was just blocks from her house, Linda had to travel all the way across town to an all-black school. Segregated, or separate, public schools were legal at the time--as long as the black and white students had an ""equal"" education. That idea was known as ""separate but equal."" However, the reality was that segregation was unequal. Schools for black students were generally run-down and overcrowded and lacked supplies. In comparison, schools for white students were newer and had smaller class sizes and better supplies. When Linda was denied entrance to the all-white school, her father and 12 other parents sued the Topeka school system. The case was eventually heard by the Supreme Court. The Court ruled that ""separate educational facilities are... unequal."" As a child, Linda Brown was part of the integration of America's public schools. Integration is the act of including people of all races. Today, Linda Brown is grown up. She travels around the country to speak about the case. She recently told the Omaha World-Herald, ""Little did [my father] know when he stepped off the witness stand, he stepped into the pages of history."""	4
"What looks like a flat blob of purple Jell-O, has a pointy snout, and had ancient relatives that hopped around the feet of dinosaurs? It's a new species, or type, of frog that scientists recently discovered. Scientists found the 3-inch-long purple leaper buried nearly 7 feet in the mud in southern India. This amphibian traces it roots back more than 175 million years to a time when dinosaurs roamed Earth. An amphibian is an animal that spends part of its life in water and the rest of its life on land. Scientists have placed the little purple hopper into a new family of frogs. There are currently 4,800 kinds of frogs, which are divided into 29 known families. Scientists say it's not every day that they discover an unknown species of frog. ""I'm absolutely amazed [about the find],"" one frog expert told the San Francisco Chronicle. ""This is really fantastic; it's weird stuff."""	4
"Scientists in southern England made a huge discovery in early January. They found the complete skull of a woolly mammoth that they estimate is 50,000 years old. Mammoth fossils have been found in different parts of the world. However, this discovery marks only the second time that mammoth remains have been unearthed in England. A woolly mammoth was a huge elephant-like creature that lived during the Ice Age. That was a period of time when blankets of ice covered the Earth. It began about 2 million years ago and ended about 11,500 years ago. A mammoth's thick, shaggy coat kept it warm during the Ice Age. Scientists believe that hunting and a rise in Earth's temperature caused woolly mammoths to die out, or become extinct. How did scientists find this particular mammoth's skull? They began digging after one scientist spotted a bone sticking out of the ground. After seven hours, they finally unearthed the 220-pound skull. Scientists believe that the mammoth was a female between 30 and 40 years old. They even found pieces of grass, believed to be the mammoth's last meal, between its teeth. The scientists hope to learn more about woolly mammoths and the time during which they lived by studying the fossil. ""We didn't expect to find anything like this,"" said one of the scientists. ""It is quite amazing."""	4
"Scientists are hoping to answer that question. In late June and early July, NASA launched two robot vehicles called rovers to Mars. Named Spirit and Opportunity, the rovers weigh about 400 pounds each and are about the size of golf carts. The rovers are scheduled to land on the Red Planet in January 2004. Mars is called the Red Planet because its soil is a dark red color. Don't expect the rovers to find little green aliens on the fourth planet from the sun. Instead, they will be on the lookout for signs that water once flowed on Mars. They will also search for evidence that some ice exists under the planet's surface. Scientists say that evidence of water on Mars can mean that life once existed on this planet. Unlike Earth, Mars is dusty, very cold, and dry. ""We're going to look for signs that tell us that Mars may have been warmer and wet in the past,"" said a Still, Mars is more like Earth than any other planet in the solar system. It has mountains, valleys, ice caps, and dry riverbeds. The seven-month journey for the rovers won't be an easy one. So far, only three of nine spacecraft that Americans and Russians have sent to Mars have completed the journey without breaking apart or failing. The rovers were launched from a rocket and will travel through space in a protective shell. They will use parachutes and air bags to bounce to their landing sites. They will land on opposite sides of the planet. The rovers are equipped with robotic arms, special tools, and cameras. As part of their mission, they will drill through rocks on Mars' surface and take pictures of them. Then, they will then send the pictures back to Earth for scientists to study. Each rover can travel about the length of a football field each day. Missions to Mars typically occur when the two planets are close to each other. Mars recently made its closest pass to Earth in 60,000 years. On August 27, Mars was only about 34 million miles from Earth."	4
Many animals use camouflage to blend into their surroundings. Some butterflies, for example, have patterns that let them hide among leaves and twigs. Most animals, however, can remain unseen only while they stay very still. Thatâ€™s why this new dragonfly finding has many scientists puzzled. The dragonfly uses motion camouflage to fool its prey into thinking that itâ€™s not moving and not a threat. The dragonflyâ€™s prey include other insects it feeds on, such as mosquitoes and moths. Researchers say that the dragonfly carefully changes position again and again as it closes in on its target. The dragonfly appears, to the eye of its prey, to remain in the same place--but in fact itâ€™s moving. What a clever eye trick!	4
"The National Book Festival, which was held on the National Mall in Washington, D.C., celebrates books and reading. Approximately 75,000 people attended the festival this year. Laura Bush told Fabien that she was happy to see such a large turnout at the festival. Fabien was nervous before the interview, but the first lady quickly put him at ease. They discussed the Harry Potter book series and shared their love of reading. In fact, the fifth grader learned that Laura Bush especially enjoyed reading Weekly Reader when she was in elementary school. ""Reading is one of the most important things you can do,"" the first lady told Fabien. ""If you love to read, you'll never be lonely-you'll always have a friend."""	4
"Few plants or animals live on the icy mountaintops in southern Argentina and Chile. The region is cold, desolate, and snowy. The ice fields there stretch along the Andes Mountains in South America and are home to 63 glaciers. Glaciers are large sheets of snow and ice that move slowly over land. Glaciers are found in the polar regions around the world and in mountain valleys. The glaciers in South America are some of the largest outside the polar regions. Because of the region's rough terrain and harsh weather, scientists have trouble reaching the area by foot. To study the melting of the South American glaciers, scientists recently relied on satellite technology. Scientists discovered that glaciers in this area are rapidly melting.In fact, they are melting twice as fast as they were just a few years ago. Erik Rignot, an expert who studied the glaciers, referred to the South American ice fields as the ""fastest area of glacial retreat on Earth."" As the glaciers melt, their water flows into lakes or oceans. As a result, the meltdown is causing sea levels to rise. If ocean levels rise by even a foot, the water could flood the world's coastal cities. What is causing the glaciers to pull a disappearing act? Warmer temperatures and less snowfall from global warming are to blame for the meltdown, say scientists. Global warming is the worldwide rise in temperature. The warmer temperatures cause the glaciers to break off into the ocean as icebergs. That process, called calving, has increased in recent years. It's not just that the South American glaciers are on thin ice. Scientists warn that about 90 percent of the world's glaciers are melting from global warming. To help solve the problem, some scientists say people must work to reduce the effects of global warming. ""Once the glaciers have melted, that's it [for them],"" said one scientist. Glaciers are large sheets of moving ice and snow. As snow accumulates, or builds up, on a glacier, the weight causes the snow underneath to turn into ice. The ice becomes so heavy that it forces the glacier to move. As glaciers slowly move, they carve out the land beneath them, carrying away rocks and soil. Glaciers erode, or gradually wear away, the land."	4
"Harry wasn't alone. Stanley Yelnats was digging up dirt in the book Holes long before he was starring on a movie set. Author Louis Sachar wrote both the book and the screenplay, or movie script. Now Dr. Seuss fans can look forward to the movie version of The Cat in the Hat, which pounces into theaters this month. This classic children's book was penned in 1957 by Theodor Seuss Geisel-better known as Dr. Seuss. Adapting, or changing, classic children's books for movies is nothing new. From The Wizard of Oz to Stuart Little and Shrek, many children's tales have been transformed into box-office successes. Bringing a beloved children's book to life is not always easy, say filmmakers. Readers often have a vision of the book in their minds. They can be easily disappointed if the movie does not live up to their vision of the original story. Another challenge that filmmakers face is having to cut long stories to fit a two-hour movie time frame. Taking a short piece of fiction like the 61-page The Cat in the Hat or the 28-page Shrek and turning it into a feature-length film is no easy task either. E.B. White's Stuart Little, a gentle tale about a mouse's adventure, became a fast-paced movie. To prepare The Cat in the Hat for the big screen, filmmakers added new characters and made plot changes, such as taking the kids outside the house. Despite the changes, filmmakers held true to Dr. Seuss' message from the book: Use your imagination to have fun. ""More than anything, I wanted to make sure we honor the book,"" said Mike Myers, the actor who plays the Cat. The movie achieves that goal through its bright scenery and costumes. It also draws on some of the book's well-known scenes. Those include images of the Cat balancing on a ball, the children looking out the window on a rainy day, and the clean-up machine. Filmmakers are always in need of strong story lines, and children's books are often a good place to find them. Ella Enchanted, The Polar Express, and Lemony Snicket's"	4
"The National Museum of African American History and Culture will be part of the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C. It will include exhibits on slavery and other important periods in black history. Getting approval for the museum was no easy task.In fact, politicians and leaders worked for almost 100 years to get the bill signed. ""This has been a long, hard effort, but we're here today,"" one government official told The New York Times. Planners estimate that building the museum will take about ten years."	4
Students at Kirkpatrick Elementary School in Nashville, Tennessee, had a day they won't forget anytime soon. They got to chat with President George W. Bush. The president visited the Nashville school in early September. Many students who participate in free tutoring sessions at the school have improved their grades and reading skills. The free tutoring sessions fall under the president's No Child Left Behind law. Bush was at the school to congratulate the principal and teachers for helping students perform better.	4
"To remember the victims, some people are building memorials. Others are volunteering in their communities. Hundreds of people in the Philadelphia area have become volunteer firefighters. Many of the new firefighters say the courage shown by New York City firefighters during and after the World Trade Center attacks inspired them to volunteer. Many New York City firefighters lost their lives trying to help others. Four Pennsylvania counties reported that 300 more volunteers graduated from firefighting school in 2002 than in the previous year. Before the 9/11 attacks, most fire departments had one to four new volunteers each year. ""I think 9/11 deeply affected me and a lot of others,"" one volunteer firefighter told the Philadelphia Inquirer. ""I felt like I wanted to do something. I wanted to do my part."" Another volunteer firefighter expressed similar feelings. ""It definitely had some impact on me and my decision to join,"" he told the Philadelphia Inquirer. ""Looking back on what many of the firefighters had to do, I feel like I'm a part of them."""	4
"Calling all couch potatoes: How much television do you watch each week? If you're like most American kids, you probably watch about three hours of television each day, says the TV-Turnoff Network. From April 19 to 25, millions of Americans will break free from their TVs. That week marks the tenth anniversary of TV-Turnoff Week. What is the goal of the week? ""It's not about giving up TV altogether,"" Frank Vespe, the head of TV-Turnoff Network told Weekly Reader. ""The week is about learning to be more conscious of how we spend our time. When kids turn off the TV, they open doors to a whole world of activities and experiences."" Health experts caution that too much television time can contribute to poor school performance, cut into family time, and make people less active. Not getting enough exercise can lead to obesity, or becoming overweight. So think about it. If you traded in your TV time, what would you like to do instead? Weekly Reader kid reporter Alex landed a slam-dunk interview with Shaquille O'Neal at the NBA All-Star Game in Los Angeles on February 15. The fourth grader edged out hundreds of reporters from around the world for a one-on-one with the basketball superstar, better known as Shaq. An unexpected guest greeted a crew aboard a barge on the Thames River in London. A passing sea gull dropped a dangerous piranha (pih-RAHN-ah) onto the boat's deck. The fish had died just before it made its crash landing. With razor-sharp teeth, piranhas are the most ferocious fish in the world. Officials were quick to assure Londoners that the Thames is safe. They believe that the 4-inch-long red-bellied piranha's owner probably released it into the river, where a sea gull picked it up. Experts say that the temperature of the Thames is too cold for piranhas to survive. These warm-water fish are found mainly in South America. Piranhas have a reputation that is worse than their bite, say some experts. ""Piranhas are generally nervous and are not the ferocious killers people think they are,"" said Paul Hale, the head of the London Aquarium. ""They prey on weak and injured animals, including fish, birds, and mammals."""	4
"Believe it or not, this is no April Fools' joke. Snakes and frogs don't have to look both ways when they cross LaRue Road in southern Illinois. Each year, this government road closes to traffic so that these creatures--and just about anything else that crawls--can safely cross without getting squashed. The U.S. Forest Service closes the road twice a year--from March 15 to May 15 and then again in the fall. Why have officials been shutting down the road for the past 30 years? An unusually high number of reptiles and amphibians cross the road during these times of the year. Many of the animals are migrating, or moving from one location to another. In spring, snakes and frogs are making their way from their winter dens to swamps where they will live for the summer. State reptile expert Scott Ballard says that the area is home to 102 species, or types, of reptiles and amphibians. That's more than any other spot in Illinois! One unlucky star--about the size of our sun--found itself on a giant black hole's dinner menu. Space-based telescopes caught images of a black hole ripping apart a star and partly devouring it. A black hole is an area of space around a collapsed star in which gravity pulls in everything around it--even light! Astronomers can't see black holes. They look for signs, such as bursts from stars, to identify black holes. It's not every day that people get carried away with kites. But the annual Smithsonian Kite Festival in Washington, D.C., gives people a reason. The event, now in its 38th year, takes place on March 27 on the National Mall, the park next to the Smithsonian museums. The theme for this year's festival is ""Kites Around the World."" At the event, people will find kite displays, demonstrations, and even a handmade kite competition. Mike Van Meers chose to make a Japanese fighter kite for the festival. ""Kites come in all shapes and sizes,"" he told Weekly Reader. Experts trace the kite's history to China more than 2,000 years ago. Kite flying took off after Chinese traders spread it to other parts of the world."	4
"Rosa's paws are big, her nose is wet, and her coat is fluffy. But she doesn't live a dog's life. The 9-year-old shepherd is a land mine-detection dog.Rosa's nose has sniffed out some of the world's 50 million land mines. Land mines are explosive devices left in the ground from wars.A land mine can explode if someone touches it, killing or injuring the person. Children often mistake the land mines for toys. Now Rosa's job is to teach U.S. children about the dangers of land mines so they can help fight the problem. I recently caught up with the clever canine at Paradise Valley Elementary School, located in Casper, Wyoming.I watched as Rosa did her job sniffing out some fake land mines. ""She's cool,"" gushed fifth grader Josh Yelton. Rosa's visit kicked off the Children Against Land Mines Program, also known as CHAMPS. The goal of the program is to raise money to buy, train, and transport mine-sniffing dogs.Wyoming students raised $5,000 in quarters in just a few short weeks, and adults chipped in an additional $8,000. The money will help sponsor a new dog. A dog's sense of smell and smarts make it the best land-mine locator. In fact, a team of six humans can search about 120 square feet of land in a day. A team of six dogs can search up to 3,000 square feet in a day's time. The pooch paid for by the Wyoming students will be named Wyoming. That dog will help find buried land mines in Sri Lanka, a country off the southern coast of India. Land mines not only injure and kill many people, but they also prevent, or stop, people from moving around freely. For example, the lush fields of Sri Lanka should be filled with crops. Instead, many fields lie unplanted. Farmers are afraid that mines litter their fields. Wyoming's job will be to help get rid of those land mines."	4
The planet is about 13 billion years old. That is about three times the age of Earth and almost as old as the universe. The ancient planet is farther from Earth than any on record. More than twice the size of Jupiter, the planet is about 5,600 light-years away. A light-year is the distance light travels in one year. The light from the distant planet left there more than 5,600 years ago. This planet isn't the first that astronomers have discovered outside our solar system. They have identified more than 100 other planets, but they have all been about the same age. What's so amazing about this new discovery? It means that planets started forming earlier than scientists originally thought.	4
"Now the pledge has found itself in a firestorm of controversy. Next year, the Supreme Court will decide whether to ban the phrase ""under God"" from the Pledge of Allegiance in public schools. According to this lower court, the words ""under God"" suggest the government endorses, or supports, religion. That violates the First Amendment. The First Amendment of the Constitution guarantees freedom of speech, religion, and press. People often refer to this freedom as the separation of church and state. The court's decision affects nearly 10 million schoolchildren in nine western states. The states that are part of the lower court's ruling include Alaska, Arizona, California, Hawaii, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, Oregon, and Washington. The ruling does not apply to public schools elsewhere in the United States. Michael Newdow of California brought the case to court. He argued that his daughter, now in the fourth grade, should not have to listen to the pledge recited daily, because of its reference to God. ""I'll keep fighting to uphold the Constitution,"" he told CNN. The Elk Grove School District in Sacramento, California, didn't agree. In response, the school district asked the U.S. Supreme Court to hear the case. The Supreme Court has the power to overturn the lower court's ruling. June 1923The words ""my Flag"" are changed to ""the flag of the United States."" A year later, ""of America"" is added to the end of that sentence. President Bush supports keeping the phrase ""under God"" in the pledge. A spokesperson for the president argues that the phrase is more about history than about religion. The official points out that there are religious references in the Declaration of Independence and the national anthem. The nation's money carries the motto ""In God We Trust,"" as well. Once the case begins next year, the steps of the Supreme Court building in Washington, D.C., will likely be the scene of protests. People on both sides of the debate will want their voices heard. Until the Supreme Court issues a final ruling, the ban on the pledge has been put on hold. But as critics of the lower court's decision argue, reciting the pledge remains voluntary. That means that schoolchildren are not required to say the pledge if they don't want to participate."	4
"No person was behind the camera's lens. The camera was triggered by motion and heat from the passing cat. Scientists from the Wildlife Conservation Society in New York have placed about 30 such cameras in trees throughout the tropical forest of Belize (beh-LEEZ). That is a country in Central America. The forest is also the site of the world's first jaguar reserve. A reserve is an area set apart for a special purpose. At the reserve in Belize, jaguars are protected and can safely roam. Belize has a healthy number of jaguars. The wildlife group estimates that about 14 jaguars live within a 55-square-mile area there. The cameras are helping researchers count the number of jaguars within certain areas of Belize and other places where jaguars roam. Today, jaguars can be found from northern Argentina in South America up through Mexico. At one time, they lived as far north as New Mexico, Arizona, and Texas. However, these powerful cats are now considered extinct in the United States. Alan Rabinowitz, a jaguar scientist, told Weekly Reader (WR) that these cats have snuck up on him in the wild. ""It happens when you least expect it. You're terrified but in complete awe."" Lucky for him, the meat-eating cats prefer wild animals, such as deer and pigs, to humans. The researchers will use that information to help protect the endangered animals. They want to conserve, or save, the jaguars' habitat. A habitat is the area where the animal naturally lives. The actions of people have caused a decline in the animal's range. The cutting down of trees has destroyed some of the jaguar's habitat. Many ranchers shoot the cats because they fear that jaguars will kill their livestock, such as sheep and cattle. Researchers say, however, that livestock are often killed by puma cats or die from disease or poor nutrition. Using cameras, scientists are keeping a watchful eye on these threatened cats and learning more about their range. As Rabinowitz points out, ""In some areas, jaguars are decreasing.

Like the golf star, this eighth grader is one of the world's youngest and most accomplished athletes.H3:Record Breaker With a Spider-Man-like ability to cling to rocks, Scott holds several records. He is the youngest person to climb to the summit, or peak, of Half Dome and El Capitan in one day each. Those famous granite peaks are located in Yosemite National Park in California.Now Scott has set his sights higher. This spring, he plans to climb both mountains within 24 hours. Scaling nearly 4,900 feet of rock is equal to climbing four Empire State Buildings in a day. Only a few experienced adult climbers have accomplished this feat in 24 hours. Climbers may take up to eight days to reach both summits. Leading Scott on his quest, or journey, will be a skilled adult climber. At 7:30 pm, Scott will begin climbing the Northwest Face. He will reach Half Dome's summit at 2:30am. Why does Scott like the challenge of the sport so much? He sums it up this way: ""Climbing is fun for me."" He also points out that climbing has taught him valuable lessons. ""You learn about trying over and over and not giving up."""	4
"Along a jagged trail of snow and ice, the teams battle Alaska's below-zero temperatures. They are competing in the Iditarod (igh-DIT-ah-rod) Trail Sled Dog Race, which kicked off on March 6. The Iditarod is the longest sled dog race in the world. This year, about 90 sled dog teams are running the roughly 1,110-mile route. The race, now in its 32nd year, starts in the city of Anchorage and ends in the city of Nome. The stretch of land the teams must cross is almost equal to the distance from New York City to Miami. A team of 12 to 16 dogs tow each sled. It can take more than two weeks for teams to complete the race. In 2002, a record holder completed the race in 8 days, 22 hours, 46 minutes, and 2 seconds. People called mushers guide and care for the dogs. Mushers must stop at all 26 checkpoints along the trail. There, animal doctors, called veterinarians, check the health of each dog. During their journey, mushers set up camp to make sure the dogs get enough food, water, and rest. The mushers and dogs are required to stop for at least one 24-hour period and two 8-hour periods. Not surprisingly, dog mushing is Alaska's state sport. Before mushing became a popular sport, dog teams served as an important form of transportation. In the late 1800s and early 1900s, miners discovered gold in Alaska. Thousands of people traveled there for the gold rush. During that time, sled dogs helped people get from place to place and transported gold, mail, and supplies. ""Dog teams were important to settling Alaska during this time,"" race director Joanne Potts told Weekly Reader. In 1925, sled dogs in Anchorage delivered lifesaving medicine to sick children in Nome. The Iditarod teams follow the same route. The race commemorates, or honors, that event and the role dog teams have played in the state's history. Experiencing this year's race up close is fourth-grade teacher Jeff Peterson, from Minnesota. Peterson, who was selected as the 2004 Teacher on the Trail, is reporting on the race. Peterson told Weekly Reader that the race is as much about the people, culture, and landscape of Alaska as it is about the dogs. ""I've been interested in the Iditarod since I was a kid,"" he said. ""To experience this race firsthand is like a dream come true."""	4
"Scientists are going ape over orangutans (o-RANG-oo-tanz). They are working to help save these endangered tree dwellers before they disappear from the wild. In recent years, the red-haired apes have found themselves out on a limb. Wildlife experts warn that they may die out, or become extinct, within the next 20 years. Scientists estimate that only 30,000 orangutans are left in the wild. Today, orangutans can be found only in tropical rain forests on the islands of Borneo and Sumatra, in Southeast Asia. They are arboreal creatures, which means they eat, sleep, and travel mainly in trees. To search for food, orangutans swing from branch to branch. They like to dine on leaves, flowers, bark, and sometimes insects. ""Orangutans spend most of their time in the trees and won't cross open grounds, so the only way they can [move]... is through the trees,"" said one wildlife expert. ""We need to maintain these forest [areas] so that orangutan populations of the future have the opportunity to continue to survive."" What is causing the numbers of orangutans to decrease at an alarming rate? The main reason is the destruction of their rain forest habitat, or home. Humans pose the greatest threat to orangutans for a number of reasons, say experts. People cut down trees for lumber. This illegal logging is destroying much of the animals' homes. Many countries, including the United States, buy the lumber. It is often used in shelves, picture frames, and floors. Forest fires and farming are also to blame. As forests are cleared to make way for plantations, orangu-tans lose parts of their habitat. In addition, orangutans have fallen victim to the recent boom in the illegal pet trade. People steal baby orangutans from the forest to sell them as pets. To help bring these animals back from the brink of extinction, wildlife groups are working to protect orangutans and stop illegal logging. The government in the area is also involved in the effort to help orangutans. Police go into national parks to prevent illegal loggers from cutting down trees. ""Help is needed to save these amazing creatures,"" orangutan expert Cheryl Knott told Weekly Reader. ""If we can save the rain forest for orangutans, we can save it for other animals as well."" The average life span for orangutans is about 50 years. Experts hope that orangutans born today will still be swinging through the trees at that age. The orangutan got its name--which means ""person of the forest""--for a reason. Orangutans are remarkably intelligent. In the wild, scientists have spotted these clever creatures using sticks as tools to open fruit. Orangutans have been observed using large leaves as umbrellas to shelter themselves from heavy rains. Sometimes, the apes even use leaves as cups, from which they drink water. Are there any endangered animals in the area where you live? What can people do to help them?"	4

Lewis and Clark's journey is an important part of our nation's history. In 1803, President Thomas Jefferson bought the Louisiana Territory from France. Called the Louisiana Purchase, it doubled the size of the United States. Jefferson chose Lewis and Clark to follow the Missouri River west and find a route to the Pacific Ocean. With more than 40 teammates and their dog, Lewis and Clark began their expedition, or journey, near St. Louis, Missouri, on May 14, 1804. The group explored and mapped the Louisiana Territory for more than two years. During that time, they discovered and recorded new plants and animals such as grizzly bears, porcupines, and prairie dogs. They returned on September 23, 1806. In two years, they had traveled more than 8,000 miles! Today, communities along the route are planning festivities and building monuments. The activities are all part of the 200th anniversary, or bicentennial, celebration, which began in 2003 and will continue through 2006.	4
"However, record companies said that by sharing music files online, Brianna was stealing. As a result, she was one of 261 people sued by the Recording Industry Association of America in early September. Brianna was targeted because she had swapped more than 1,000 songs online. Approximately 60 million people download music files from the Internet. In most cases, that is against the law. The music industry has compared it with shoplifting, saying most people wouldn't steal CDs from a store. There are laws that exist to protect the rights of musicians. The laws say it is illegal to copy songs without permission from musicians and record companies. During the past three years, CD sales have fallen. The recording industry says it loses billions of dollars each year when people pirate, or steal, songs. The music industry is hoping the lawsuits will scare people away from swapping songs online. The lawsuits have left many people stunned. Some are concerned that innocent people might be wrongly accused when their children or grandchildren download music. One 71-year-old grandfather from Texas is being sued. He didn't know that his grandchildren had copied music onto his computer. Some people have said they didn't know they were breaking the law. Others think the record companies are bullies picking on ordinary people. Brianna's mother didn't take any chances. Agreeing to pay $2,000, she became the first of the 261 people to settle the lawsuit and to avoid having to go to court. ""I am sorry for what I have done,"" said Brianna. ""I love music and don't want to hurt the artists I love."" During the past three years, music sales have suffered a huge loss. Record industry officials blame the drop on the increasing number of people who get their songs free on the Internet. To draw music fans back into stores, the world's largest record company announced a few weeks ago that it would lower its CD prices. Universal Music Group said its CDs would sell in stores for about $12.98 instead of the current prices ranging from $16.98 to $18.98. For people who still want to get their music online, they can do it without breaking the law. Some music-sharing services on the Web work in a similar way to record stores. The services charge a small fee for each song that is copied. Do you think fear of being punished will stop people from swapping music online? Why or why not?"	4
"Wagner collected more than a million pennies in all. Over the years, he stored the pennies in 41 / 2-gallon buckets in his garage. After several bank visits to cash in 37 buckets of coins, Wagner came home with about $10,060 in paper money! How did he become so penny-wise? ""I thought that it'd be interesting to have a million [pennies],"" he said. According to Wagner, if all his pennies were stacked end to end, they would be 4,600 feet high. That is about four times as tall as the Empire State Building, in New York City. Wagner admits that spending pennies is now hard for him to do. That could be because he knows how to make every penny count. As his wife points out, ""Some people think that pennies don't add up to anything, but this is proof that they do."""	4
"As the clock ticks down toward Thanksgiving, the Macy's Parade Studio buzzes with activity. The sounds of saws, drills, and hammers echo through the former Tootsie Roll factory in New Jersey. The workers have no time to spare. I'm getting a sneak preview as they prepare for the 77th Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade in New York City. More than 2 million people will line the parade route. Another 60 million people will watch on TV. I meet with John Piper and his talented team, who produce every detail of the huge parade. Piper is in charge of the studio. His crew designs and builds the floats and giant balloons that appear in the parade. The 2003 Macy's parade lineup features 15 giant helium balloons and 27 smaller balloons. Also included will be 29 floats, some of which contain cold-air balloons called ""falloons."" Ten marching bands and 30 groups of clowns will spice up the festivities. In a large room next door, I watch as Piper checks the 49-foot-long Garfield balloon for leaks. On Thanksgiving morning, more than 50 Macy's ""handlers"" will steer the balloon 2.5 miles along the skyscraper-lined streets of New York City. Downstairs, head painter Beth Lucas puts the final touches on an 8-foot-tall eagle. The giant bronze bird will be at the center of the ""Spirit of America"" float. Nearby, other workers hammer away from atop a wooden frame that will become the ""Bridge to the Future"" float. The float will feature the newest Hess toy truck and race cars. All the Macy's floats are weatherproof. When folded, they must be no more than 12.5 feet tall and 8 feet wide. That size allows them to fit through the Lincoln Tunnel on their way from the New Jersey studio to New York City. Piper tells me that working on the parade is a dream come true. ""When I was a kid, my two favorite things in the world were cartoons and things that fly,"" he adds. ""The Macy's parade puts both of them together."""	4
"The popular movie snack food joins the cardinal, which is the state bird, and the white oak, which is the state tree, on the list of state symbols. Illinois is among the top states in the country where popcorn is grown. The idea to raise popcorn to a new level came from a group of second- and third-grade students. They called themselves the Kernel Kids. The governor of the state signed the bill into law in a library near Cunningham Elementary School, where the Kernel Kids attended class last school year. He said the project gave students a firsthand look at how a bill becomes a law. To celebrate, government officials, teachers, students, and parents munched on the honored snack. The Kernel Kids wore popcorn hats that they made for the special day. ""We feel good,"" a 9-year-old student said. ""We did something that not many other kids usually get to do. It makes us really proud--and our parents."" Their teacher was also proud of her students' efforts. ""I'm so happy for these kids,"" she said. ""They worked so hard. They'll probably remember this for the rest of their lives."""	4
"Greetings from Mars! NASA officials are thrilled that they're getting messages from the Red Planet. The messages aren't handwritten notes. Instead, they include pictures and data that scientists are studying. Scientists have the twin rovers Spirit and Opportunity to thank. The rovers--each the size of a golf cart--successfully touched down on opposite sides of the Red Planet in January. Now NASA scientists have even more reason to celebrate. They recently announced that Opportunity found hard evidence that Mars' dry surface was once ""soaking wet."" ""We have concluded the rocks here were once soaked in liquid water,"" said NASA scientist Steve Squyres. The finding is important to scientists because clues of water could mean that life once existed on Mars. Both rovers are equipped with instruments to help scientists study the rocks. Each rover has a robotic arm that drills into the rocks and cameras that snap photographs. Opportunity detected minerals called sulfates in the rocks. Sulfates form in the presence of water. The rover also found ""blueberries"" scattered throughout the rock. Blueberries are what NASA calls small balls of mineral that can form in water or be created by a volcano. Because Mars' blueberries are mixed in the rock instead of sprinkled on top, scientists believe that the blueberries were formed by water, not volcanoes. Now that scientists have received postcards from the Red Planet, when will the care package arrive? NASA has tentatively planned an unmanned mission to Mars about ten years from now that will bring back rocks for scientists to study."	4
"Imagine that you could convert all the fake bills in a Monopoly game into real money. For Matt McNally, that dream came true. The California man won $15,140-the amount of money found in the bank of the Monopoly game. The tournament was held aboard a train hired especially for the event. Called the ""Reading Railroad,"" the train was named after a railroad property on the game board. Although the tournament has taken place every four years since 1973, this year's event was the first to be held on a moving train. Players boarded in Chicago and began rolling the dice. In 1934, Charles B. Darrow of Pennsylvania invented Monopoly. The Parker Brothers company bought the game in 1935 and has since sold more than 200 million copies worldwide. In addition to his prize money, McNally looks forward to representing the United States in the 2004 World Monopoly Championship in China. ""I can't wait,"" McNally told CNN."	4
"Every four years, Americans vote for the president of the United States. This year, Election Day takes place on November 2. During the past months, candidates have been busy gearing up for the election. They have been giving speeches, participating in debates, meeting voters, and advertising on television and radio. January is especially important in the election process because it marks the first primaries and caucuses. Those are special elections in which people vote for the person they want as their party's candidate for president. There are two main political parties, or groups, in the United States. They are the Democratic party and the Republican party. Members of the Democratic party are called Democrats. Members of the Republican party are called Republicans. At press time, nine Democrats want to be chosen as their party's presidential candidate. The Democrat who wins will run against President George W. Bush. Bush is a member of the Republican party and is campaigning for re-election. Winning primaries and caucuses is important to candidates. A win means a candidate has a state's support at the party's national convention later in the year. At this year's convention, the Democrats will nominate, or choose, a candidate to run against President Bush. Some political polls, which survey people's opinions, show that Howard Dean is considered the leader among the Democrats who hope to run against Bush on Election Day. Dean is a former governor of Vermont. Massachusetts Senator John Kerry is also running. He pointed out to USA Today, ""The race is not over until all the votes have been cast and counted."" In the end, the American people will choose the next president on Election Day. Who do you think will be the next president to call the White House home? What red, white, and blue vehicles are cruising around the United States? The new ABC election buses! The election buses, which hit the road this month, are TV studios on wheels. They are traveling around the country so that reporters can cover the presidential campaign. ABC News and Weekly Reader have teamed up to teach kids about elections. While on the campaign trail, the buses will make stops at schools. The nearly nine-month manhunt for Saddam Hussein ended on December 13. That is when U.S. troops captured the former Iraqi leader hiding in a 6-foot by 8-foot hole near his hometown, just north of Baghdad. The situation in Iraq will be one of the main issues, or concerns, that candidates will address in this year's election. Many people wonder what effect Saddam's capture will have on the election. Some people think that his capture might give President Bush an advantage. Others aren't so sure. They think that Bush's popularity will drop if violence continues in Iraq. ""The capture of Saddam is good news for the people of Iraq and the world,"" said Democratic presidential candidate and former U.S. Senator Carol Moseley Braun. ""But it does not change the fact that our troops remain in harm's way, and we are no closer to bringing them home."""	4
"Australia is often called ""the land down under."" That's because it lies in the Southern Hemisphere. Stretching 1,250 miles along Australia's northeastern coast, the Great Barrier Reef is the longest coral reef in the world. A coral reef is a living underwater structure. But these days, the Great Barrier Reef has found itself in trouble. Over fishing, pollution, and high temperatures are harming its health. That's why the government in Australia is trying to help rescue the reef. While coral may look like a plant, it is actually made up of tiny sea animals. Those sea animals are called coral polyps. As polyps die, they leave hard shells behind. Other polyps grow on top of the shells. Over thousands of years, they form a coral reef in warm water that is not very deep. In many ways, the Great Barrier Reef resembles an underwater garden. Coral can be hard or soft. It forms in different colors and in strange shapes. Some coral looks like hardened brains. Other coral looks like fans and lettuces. The reef bursts with schools of tropical fish, darting among gaps in the coral. The reef supplies food and shelter to creatures living in and around the coral. Turtles, sharks, sea horses, and crabs are among its many inhabitants. The reef also acts as a barrier to keep waves from slamming against the shore. While the reef is important to ocean life, it helps humans, too. People rely on the reef for both food and jobs. It also provides medicine used to treat disease. Each year, the Great Barrier Reef contributes about $975 million to the economy through tourism and fishing. Is it surprising, then, that the Great Barrier Reef is under too much stress? Fishing nets and ships break off sections and damage the reef. Air and water pollution are also doing harm. At the same time, warmer sea temperatures have caused coral bleaching on half of the reef. The high temperatures cause the coral to turn white, often killing it. In an effort to help save the reef, the government has limited fishing to two-thirds of it. That plan increases the number of ""green zones."" Those are areas that are off-limits to fishermen and boats. However, tourists and researchers can still visit them. Many fishermen are upset about the plan because they rely on the reef for jobs. The Australian government says that its plan will help keep the reef safe from some threats. ""It is very important that we give the reef proper protection for the future,"" said one government official. ""The reef is Australia's greatest natural [treasure]."" Ships and fishing nets are destroying the Great Barrier Reef. They sometimes break off large sections of the reef. The crown of thorns eats living coral. It has destroyed large areas of the Great Barrier Reef. These soft, yellow coral polyps are shaped like tubes. They use their tentacles to catch food. Coral polyps are related to jellyfish. This coral has been damaged. Do you see the white areas where the coral has been bleached?"	4
Textbooks in China are getting a makeover. For years, schoolchildren in that Asian country have learned that the Great Wall of China could be seen from space. Education officials recently ordered school textbook publishers to stop printing the myth, or falsehood. In October 2003, Yang Liwei, China's first person in space, reported that he could not see the wall when he orbited Earth. Liwei's comments contradict the last man on the moon. In 1972, a U.S. astronaut reported that the famous monument was visible from space. More than 2,000 years old, the Great Wall is the longest structure ever built. Experts estimate that the Great Wall of China is about 4,000 miles long.	4
"There really is an old lady who lives in a shoe. Ruth Miller, a 77-year-old great-grandmother, has put her shoe-shaped house in Pennsylvania up for sale. Miller is selling the house because she and her husband want to travel. Standing 25 feet tall, the pink shoe house includes three bedrooms, two bathrooms, a living room, and a kitchen. A copy of the famous nursery rhyme hangs on a wall in the house. The home, a popular tourist attraction, is located on Shoe House Road. The street was named in honor of the house. ""People look [surprised] when I tell them I live in a shoe,"" she said. ""It's [small] but comfortable because it is very well designed."" In 1948, a footwear salesman had the house made. When he died in 1962, a dentist bought the house and turned it into an ice-cream parlor. Miller bought the house in 1995, and she and her husband opened it up to tourists."	4
"Scientists have given new meaning to the words ""jet speed."" In early March, a NASA jet set a new record for speed. The unpiloted X-43A jet flew nearly 5,000 miles per hour. That is equal to seven times the speed of sound. The aircraft made a 10-second powered flight and then glided for six minutes before plunging into the Pacific Ocean off the coast of California. ""Everything worked according to plan. It's been wonderful,"" said NASA's Leslie Williams. ""We've been waiting a few years."" NASA attempted to fly a similar unmanned jet three years earlier. However, a failure in the launch system caused the flight to explode. In 1947, American pilot Chuck Yeager became the first person to fly at supersonic speed, or faster than the speed of sound. NASA hopes its record-breaking feat will lead to a new era of supersonic flight for military, business, and space ventures."	4
"One former teacher doesn't miss a beat with schoolkids today. As a child, David Wish took violin lessons but dreamed of playing the guitar. He would stand in front of a mirror with a broom and pretend it was his guitar. Wish eventually quit the violin and learned how to play the guitar. Today, he shares his love of rock-and-roll with schoolkids across the country. In 1996, Wish started a program called Little Kids Rock. The program reaches about 2,000 children in public schools in New York City and San Francisco along with Memphis, Tennessee and Newark, New Jersey. Little Kids Rock puts free instruments in the hands of students where music programs have been cut. Though some of the classes are part of the school day, many are held before or after school. Wish enlisted the help of many famous performers. Among the celebrities are singers Bonnie Raitt and Carlos Santana, blues artist B.B. King, and longtime Billy Joel drummer Liberty DeVitto. They participate in the program because they believe that music is just as important as math or social studies in school. The program made an impact on one third-grade student in New York City. In addition to becoming a baseball player, his career plans now include becoming a singer. He said, ""I could sit in the [dugout] and sing Lil' Bow Wow."""	4
"About ten years ago, 29,000 yellow rubber ducks that were headed for bathtubs around the country became lost at sea. Boxes of the toys fell off a ship during a storm in the Pacific Ocean. Plastic beavers, turtles, and frogs were included in the shipment too. Since 1992, an oceanographer has been tracking the toys' journey. An oceanographer is a scientist who studies the ocean. The plastic toys floated along Alaska's coast and through the Bering Strait. Bobbing past polar bears and seals, the toys were caught in ice around the North Pole for several years. They eventually made their way into the North Atlantic Ocean. Some washed up in Iceland. According to oceanographers, the ducks are now due to waddle ashore in New England and Canada. The ducks' voyage is teaching oceanographers some lessons about currents, including how trash and ocean pollution travel. ""When trash goes into the ocean, it doesn't disappear,"" said the oceanographer tracking the ducks. ""It just goes somewhere else."" To help with the research, The First Years, the company that owns the plastic toys, is offering a $100 savings bond for any duck that is returned by the end of the year. The ducks' color has faded, but there is a way to identify the plastic creatures. They are stamped with the words the first years. Not just any duck will do. It has to be from the First Years flock! Believe it or not, many toy ducks are floating around the ocean. They are often left over from duck-race fundraisers. To learn more about the ducks, visitwww.weeklyreader.com/kids/ grade4/links."	4
"She makes sure she has it on correctly. ""It's important to wear a helmet because if you fall you could get really hurt or injured,"" she says. Like Kristina, more kids than ever before are wearing bike helmets. A new study showed that 73 out of every 100 kids riding bikes had a helmet strapped to their head. But there is flip side. The study also reported that most kids are not wearing their helmets correctly. In fact, only 4 out of 100 kids in the study wore their helmet properly. Wearing a helmet incorrectly can lead to injury. The helmet should rest on your head in a straight position and should cover your forehead. The chin strap should fit around your ears in a V shape. Make sure the strap is snug and fastened. If your helmet is rocking forward and backward or from side to side, it's not protecting your head properly. Health experts say that wearing a helmet correctly when you ride a bike or do any wheel sport--for that matter-- is important. That's because helmets can protect your head and brain from injuries if you should happen to fall. The outside of the helmet is made of plastic, and the inside is lined with a stiff foam to help keep your head safe. In addition to wearing a helmet, you should remember to protect other parts of your body. Other gear, such as kneepads and elbow pads, help protect you if you should fall or crash. Kristina makes sure she wears kneepads and elbow pads each time she rides her bike. She knows how important it is to put safety first!"	4
"Today, it is the site of a different kind of struggle. Heavy traffic and noisy jets from a nearby airport threaten the peace at this historic landmark. This year, the National Trust for Historic Preservation added the park to its list of the 11 Most Endangered Historic Places in the United States. An endangered place is a site in danger of being destroyed. To protect the park, officials will try to stop the airport's growth. Neglect and the development of roads and buildings are dangers for many historic sites. The trust works to preserve, or save, threatened historic treasures. It also helps raise money to support endangered historic sites. More than 145 sites have appeared on the trust's list since 1988. All have been saved except one. Bridges, schools, hospitals, and even an airport terminal made this year's list. A terminal is a transportation station. The TWA Terminal at John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York was designed by a famous architect and completed in 1962. Many people have traveled through it over the years. Now there are plans to knock it down to make way for a new building. Officials at the trust want to save the terminal. ""These places tell us who we are as a nation,"" said the president of the National Trust. He says that unless people become aware of the importance of these historic sites and take action to protect them, ""America's past won't have a future.""

"He obviously wasn't aware of what was flying around in the minds of Orville and Wilbur Wright. The brothers-bicycle makers from Dayton, Ohio-dreamed of building the world's first flying machine. Just four years later, on a bitterly cold December day, the Wright brothers succeeded-and changed the world forever. On December 17, 1903, Orville Wright made the first successful airplane flight on a windy beach at Kitty Hawk, North Carolina. Called the Wright Flyer, the brothers' plane flew 120 feet. That is less than half the length of a football field. Although the flight lasted only 12 seconds, it steered the course of history in a new direction. The brothers launched the age of flight, or aviation. Orville and Wilbur Wright took to the sky three more times that historic day. Wilbur completed the longest flight, which lasted 59 seconds. He flew a distance of 852 feet-nearly the length of three football fields. Today, visitors can get a close-up look at the Wright Flyer. It is on exhibit at the Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum in Washington, D.C. The exhibit celebrates the centennial, or 100th anniversary, of the Wright brothers' famous flight. Other historic planes from the past century, such as the Spirit of St. Louis and Glamorous Glennis, are also displayed. Across the country, people are commemorating, or honoring, the 100th anniversary. Festivals, flight shows, museum exhibits, and reenactments of the Wrights' original flight are being held. Schoolchildren in the Wright brothers' hometown of Dayton, Ohio, recently celebrated the anniversary. They helped build a replica, or copy, of the first plane. It was tested at Kitty Hawk. Other flight fans have built replicas that will be flown at Kitty Hawk on December 17. The Wright brothers' courage and innovation inspired a hundred years of amazing achievements in the sky. Today, jumbo jets crisscross oceans daily. Powered flight has connected all parts of the world, changing the way people travel and conduct business. The U.S. military uses planes to fight wars. The government employs aircraft to track weather patterns. The Wright brothers' invention has even led humans to soar beyond the clouds and into space. 1932: Amelia Earhart becomes the first woman to fly alone across the Atlantic Ocean. In 1937, she vanishes without a trace over the Pacific Ocean in an attempt to fly around the world. 1969: Buzz Aldrin is the second man on the moon. With ""one small step for man and one giant leap for mankind,"" Neil Armstrong becomes the first human to walk on the moon. 1976: The Concorde, the world's only supersonic passenger jet, begins service. The fleet, which flies faster than the speed of sound, is grounded this October because it is too expensive to run. 2000-2003: Humans get a place in space. This year marks the third anniversary of continuous human presence aboard the International Space Station. Where do you think the next century of flight will take us? Why?"	4
"At the end of July, Felix broke a world record. He became the first person to fly across the English Channel without an aircraft. The English Channel is a body of water that separates England from France. Felix began his adventure by jumping from a plane 30,000 feet above the coast of England. That is about as high as Mount Everest. Felix parachuted down until he landed in a town on the coast of France. It took him about 14 minutes to cross the Channel, flying at speeds of up to 200 miles per hour. Felix wore a special suit and had a gliding wing strapped to his back. He carried oxygen with him to help him breathe. Thatâ€™s because the air that high up is very thin. Felix, who began parachuting as a teenager, referred to another piece of flying history. ""Itâ€™s [100 years ago] that the Wright brothers were doing the first flight with a plane,"" he said, ""and now Iâ€™m here, with my little wing."""	4
"In mid-October, fifth graders watched as rolls of paper were released from the ceiling at the new Walt Disney Concert Hall in Los Angeles. Waving the paper, tapping on it, or blowing on it were some of the many ways musicians made sounds. The paper instruments were part of a special performance called Inventions for Paper Instruments and Orchestra. Chinese composer Tan Dun wrote the piece. He also invented and made the paper instruments used in the performance. Dun's piece honors the art of papermaking and pays tribute to his Chinese heritage. Paper as we know it today was invented about 2,000 years ago in China. The paper instruments allowed schoolchildren to hear how the shape of the concert hall affects sound. One 10-year-old girl from Los Angeles said that the concert hall sounded ""like a giant stereo."" Dun says that the performance shows children that music can come from everyday objects. ""Using your imagination, you can find music around you, even in paper,"" Dun told Weekly Reader. ""Music is everywhere if you just look for it."""	4
Known for their loud, piercing sound, the four-winged insects are cicadas (sih-KAY-duhz). One type of these insects (Brood X) will emerge from the ground after a 17-year hiatus, or break. In certain parts of the country, there's no escaping the sound. The noise-makers can be found from Georgia and Tennessee northward into parts of Missouri, the Ohio Valley, and Michigan and into New Jersey and New York in the east. Entomologists (scientists who study insects) say that as quickly as the cicadas arrive, they will disappear. Young cicadas hatch from eggs and feed on tree roots in the soil. As adults, they emerge from the ground, crawl out of their shells, and open their wings. Although cicadas make a lot of noise and can be annoying, entomologists say they are relatively harmless. They don't bite, sting, or even harm trees.	4
The war with Iraq changed the course of history, and Iraqis prepared for a future without Saddam Hussein. The ocean tale Finding Nemo hooked movie audiences, making it the top-grossing animated film. And the Florida Marlins brought home the trophy as the World Series champs. Some of the year's most memorable events were captured in photographs. Photos help us understand news stories. Which news story do you consider the most important of the year? Why? Take a look back at some of the year's top events. August 14: Stranded commuters file across a bridge in New York City after trains and subways lost power. A shutdown in the nation's power grid caused the worst blackout in U.S. history.

"This guinea pig wouldn't make a very good class pet. That's because it was about the size of a buffalo! Scientists recently discovered the fossils of a giant rodent that weighed 1,545 pounds and lived 6 million to 8 million years ago. This cousin of the rat is believed to be the largest rodent that ever roamed Earth. Scientists unearthed its skeleton in a dry region of Venezuela. That is a country in South America. Nicknamed ""Goya,"" the rodent lived in an area that once was made up of grassy marshes. Along with the giant crocodiles and giant turtles of the time, Goya lived along the banks of a swamp. There, it used its long teeth to dine on large amounts of grasses. At about 9 feet long and 4 feet tall, the rodent couldn't move very fast. Its hefty size made it very difficult to outrun an attacking animal. A changing climate and threats from other animals might have caused the animal's extinction, say scientists."	4
"For the 13-year-old bargain shopper, clipping coupons is the secret to saving. She's gotten hundreds of dollars worth of products free! ""If you just take a little time, it can save you a lot of money,"" Lisa said. The Texas teen collects coupons from newspapers, magazines, and the Internet. Even her neighbors pass along coupons to her. Lisa likes to use them on days when stores double and triple coupon values. This coupon girl doesn't keep all her bargains to herself, though. Instead, she donates the groceries that she buys with her coupons to a local food bank. How did Lisa come up with her bargain-hunting idea? Earlier this year, Lisa's mother challenged her to buy $50 worth of products with $25. Lisa did much better than that. At last count, Lisa bought more than $1,120 worth of products without spending anything. What's her best bargain? Lisa got a bottle of sunscreen that costs $8.99 free with a special offer called a rebate. Now, that's an eye for a bargain!"	4
"Have you ever stayed up late to finish watching a movie? If so, you know that not getting enough sleep can leave you tired, grouchy, and unable to think clearly the next day. Scientists have long known that getting a good night's sleep helps kids perform their best during the day. Now, a new study from German scientists shows that getting a good night's sleep helps improve problem-solving skills and creative thinking. For the study, scientists divided volunteers into two groups to complete a math problem. The group that received eight hours of sleep solved the problem more often than the group that didn't get enough sleep. While you sleep, your brain is busy doing its ""homework,"" sorting out information from your day. Getting enough sleep each night can boost your brainpower and help you perform your best in school. Experts say that, in turn, can lead to better grades. Sleep expert Carl Hunt told Weekly Reader that elementary-school children need at least nine hours of sleep a night. ""You'll be able to do your best if you are well rested,"" he said."	4
An American classic turns 50 this year--the Wiffle ball! In air, the round, hollow ball dips and curves, making it hard to hit. The Wiffle ball's design, which has not changed since 1953, includes eight holes on one side. The idea was the brainchild of a Connecticut man who watched his 12-year-old son and a friend struggle to throw curve balls to each other. Early versions of the Wiffle ball included square holes and diamond-shaped holes. Neither of them worked. How did the ball get its name? When you swing that plastic yellow bat and strike out, you whiff, said the creator's son.	4
"A group of boys stare excitedly at some resting lions. The lions are among the few animals that can be seen at a zoo in Baghdad, the capital of Iraq. The zoo reopened its doors over the summer. It welcomed its first visitors since the war with Iraq began in March. Today, the Baghdad zoo is home to about 80 animals. In addition to the lions, the zoo's animals include brown bears, monkeys, cheetahs, and rare birds. Before the war began, this zoo in Baghdad was one of the largest in the Middle East. More than 600 animals were housed there. When fighting began, the zoo was turned into a battleground. At one point, the zoo's population dropped to as few as six animals. Many animals died and others were stolen, especially many of the birds. The cages of other animals were left open. Animals, such as lions and camels, roamed the streets. Other animals, locked in their cages, were left without food and water. U.S. soldiers were the first people to come to the animals' rescue. They secured the zoo, found some of the wild creatures, and helped feed them. Since then, wildlife groups have helped nurse many of the sick animals back to health. To people in Iraq, the reopened zoo is a sign of hope for their country. ""The Iraqi people see it as a small but important step in returning the country to [normal],"" said one wildlife rescue worker."	4
"Arnold Schwarzenegger celebrates his newest role-governor of California. Best known for his part in the Terminator movies, Schwarzenegger ""terminated"" Democratic Governor Gray Davis from his second term in office. The Republican Schwarzenegger was elected governor of California in the state's special recall election in October. The actor-turned-politician begins his new role as governor this month."	4
"What do you get when you cross blueberries with meat? Sometimes you get a blueberry hamburger! Some scientists hope that blueberry burgers will soon be on your school cafeteria's menu. Food scientist Al Bushway told Weekly Reader (WR) that his lab has experimented with adding blueberry powder and blueberry puree (PYOO-ray) to beef, chicken, and turkey. Puree is a thick paste. It's made when fruit is mashed in a blender. Why the odd food combination? Bushway says it's a way to increase the nutrition in meat. Blueberries are rich in special chemicals that help fight diseases, such as cancer. Bushway hopes to make school lunches more healthful. Do blueberries turn the meat blue? ""In beef, you can't see the difference,"" Bushway told WR. ""However, ground turkey turns a grayish blue color."" With an adult's help, kids can try this fruit-and-meat combo at home, says Bushway. He recommends thawing 1/2 to 1 ounce of frozen blueberries, pureeing them, and adding them to meat."	4
"Meet a robot that has been busy tooting its own horn. A trumpet-playing robot made its debut at a hotel in Japan in March. The robot played the song ""When You Wish Upon a Star."" After its performance, the 4-foot-tall droid bowed its head and waved its arms in response to the audience's applause. Although the musical droid doesn't have a name yet, it is the latest in a string of humanoid robots that scientists have built in the past few years. Humanoid robots are high-tech machines that act lifelike and are programmed to do jobs that people typically do. Japanese companies lead the way in creating humanoid robots. Japan is thought to be the leader in robotics, or robot technology. Japanese scientists introduced ASIMO (ah-SEE-moh), the world's first stair-climbing robot, in 2000. The 4-foot, 115-pound ASIMO's many talents include walking, holding objects, speaking Japanese, and recognizing faces. ASIMO recently finished a world tour. The tour included several stops in U.S. cities so kids and adults could learn more about it. Like ASIMO, QRIO (KYOOR-ee-oh), can talk and recognize faces. QRIO, which was unveiled in Japan in December 2003, can also run, jump, throw a ball, dance, and even belt out a tune. In March, QRIO conducted Beethoven's Fifth Symphony in Japan. Before the rehearsal in front of a live audience, the robot grumbled, ""I'm feeling nervous."" Today, robots come in all shapes and sizes. Many robots are used in factories. They help build cars, inspect computer parts, and package food. Robots speed up production on assembly lines and help save companies both time and money. Robots also perform tasks that are difficult or dangerous for humans. Robots have explored the far reaches of space and traveled into active volcanoes. One scientist told U.S. News and World Report that when robots were first introduced in the 1960s, they performed only jobs that were ""dirty, difficult, and dangerous."" That, however, is starting to change. Today's engineers hope that the new breed of humanoid robots will improve people's lives. Many people are excited that humanoid robots may one day be able to lift people confined to beds or wheelchairs. The robots may also be able to help elderly people with chores such as vacuuming and taking out the garbage. Some people, however, worry that robots may take away jobs that are now performed by humans. Although the humanoid robots have been busy making public appearances, they aren't for sale yet. If you really want a robot that will clean your room and help out with chores, you still have to wait a bit longer. 1. QRIO shows off some dancing skills. QRIO stands for ""quest for curiosity."" Why do you think the robot was given that name? 2. ASIMO (which is short for Advanced Step in Innovative MObility) walks down a flight of stairs. 3. In March, this latest humanoid robot-still unnamed-plays the trumpet at its first public appearance in Japan. 1. Robotic arms build cars. 2. Sico the robot helps children paint pictures at an Arkansas hospital. 3. There is a two wheeled robot that can guide blind people."	4
The actor recently announced that he is running for governor of California in the state's recall election on October 7. The recall is a special election allowed by California law. People will vote whether to remove the current governor, Gray Davis, from office. Some people in California are unhappy with the job that Davis is doing. They blame him for the state's money problems. Schwarzenegger, the star of movies such as Terminator 3 and Kindergarten Cop, is one of many people running to replace Davis. The actor is getting a lot of attention because of his movie-star status. Schwarzenegger is no stranger to politics. From 1990 to 1993, he headed the Council on Physical Fitness under President George H. W. Bush. In 2002, he helped raise millions of dollars for school programs in California. Schwarzenegger isn't the first actor to try to make the move from Hollywood star to governor. Movie star Ronald Reagan was elected governor of California in 1966. He then served as U.S. president from 1981 to 1989. Even if he is elected, Schwarzenegger won't be following Reagan's path to the White House. He was not born in the United States, which is a requirement for being president.	4
"Nine-year-old Dakota Fanning stepped into a world most kids only dream about. She got to hang out with a hat wearing, talking cat! Dakota, who has been acting since she was 6 years old, plays Sally in the movie Dr. Seuss' The Cat in the Hat. Weekly Reader (WR) caught up with Dakota after filming. Here's what she told us: Dakota: We all had a fabulous time on the movie! Mike Myers [who plays the Cat] was fabulous to work with! He just made you laugh every second of the day. I think all the actors in the movie had a responsibility to keep Dr. Seuss' legacy alive. Dakota: She was so crazy! She always had a green Palm Pilot with her. She was very scheduled and had her to-do list. Her list included things that kids our age would never think of, such as ""Be spontaneous!"" Dakota: I love The Cat in the Hat. It is my number-one favorite. Then I love Green Eggs and Ham. Dakota: I've had a teacher for the past three years, since I've been doing movies. She does school on the set with me every day. In between breaks and the setup for scenes, I go to the school trailer. When I'm not working, I go to her house for school. Dakota: I love to knit a lot! I knit and go to class between scenes when I'm filming a movie."	4
"It has never been smooth sailing for the Titanic. On April 14, 1912, the luxury liner struck an iceberg on its first voyage and sank to the bottom of the North Atlantic Ocean. Now the world's most famous shipwreck is rapidly falling apart, say divers. ""I was really quite shocked [by its condition],"" said one ocean scientist who recently visited the wreck. He was surprised to see how much the Titanic wreck had changed since his dive four years earlier. ""It is just deteriorating so much more rapidly than I would have expected."" Salt water, ocean currents, and rusticles are partly to blame for the damage. Rusticles are clusters of brown ""icicles"" made from rust. They form from tiny iron-eating organisms called microbes. Each day, microbes chew off about 600 pounds of iron from the ship's hull, or body. Natural causes aren't the only culprits. Tourists, filmmakers, and divers also threaten the wreck. In 1985, ocean explorer Robert Ballard and his team discovered the wreck. They found it in two pieces about 350 miles off the coast of Newfoundland. The team was amazed at how well the ship had withstood the test of time. In fact, they believed it would remain in good condition for years to come. But that's no longer the case. Since its discovery, the Titanic wreck has drawn filmmakers, scientists, and even tourists. During the past 18 years, divers have recovered objects-from shoes to dinnerware to life preservers-from the wreck. Thieves have also stolen items. Some tourists pay thousands of dollars to visit the Titanic in mini submarines called submersibles. They have left plastic flowers and memorial plaques behind. In 2001, a couple was married in a small submarine next to the wreck. Each time a mini sub visits the site, further damage occurs. The propellers swirl around the rusticles and stir up the sandy bottom. ""Visitors do more damage than anybody else,"" said the president of the Titanic Historical Society. In recent years, the mast, boat deck, and officer cabins have all collapsed. So has the crow's-nest where a lookout once warned, ""Iceberg right ahead!"" Ocean experts fear that the rest of the ship could fall apart within the next 50 years. Government officials in the United States, Great Britain, Canada, and France are exploring ways to save the wreck. Historians continue to debate whether people should be allowed to visit the shipwreck. Some think it should be left as a memorial to those who sank with the ship. Marine explorer Robert Ballard found the Titanic wreck 18 years ago. He told Weekly Reader that he had mixed feelings about the discovery. Although he felt both pride and joy, he also remembered that the site is a graveyard. ""I couldn't help but think about the [more than 1,500] lost souls who died,"" he said. Do you think it's important to preserve the Titanic? Why or why not?"	4

"This map might not lead to a pot of gold, but officials at the Library of Congress consider it very valuable. The Library of Congress recently paid $10 million for the first map to name America. Printed in 1507, the map is the only copy of its kind left in the world. Officials said the map is the most expensive item that the library has ever purchased. The library raised most of the money from Congress and other groups. America was named after Amerigo Vespucci, an Italian explorer. The map showing America was kept in a castle in Germany for 350 years and was rediscovered in 1901. For the last century, U.S. officials have been trying to buy the map. It has been called the ""crown jewel"" of the library's map collection."	4
"The Liberty Bell no longer rings today. During the move, wireless technology will be attached to the bell. Why the change of address? It is part of improvements being made to the area where the bell now hangs. Moving the bell, which weighs 2,080 pounds, could be tricky. Movers want to make sure that no additional harm is done to the bell's famous crack. During the move, scientists will attach wireless technology to the bell. That technology will sound an alarm if strain from the move causes the crack to enlarge. Earlier this year, scientists conducted a test using wireless technology, and the crack did not appear to change. ""The bell is fragile because of the way it was [made],"" said one historian. The bell was built mostly of copper. In 1752, the bell was brought to Philadelphia from England. The bell was rung to mark special events. It became a symbol of freedom in the United States. It was rung to call people to the first public reading of the Declaration of Independence on July 8, 1776. That document was signed on July 4, 1776. This is not the first time the Liberty Bell has moved. From 1885 to 1915, the Liberty Bell traveled across the country, taking part in several World's Fair exhibits. During those years, it visited more than 400 cities and towns, including New Orleans, St. Louis, and San Francisco. At that time, it was taken from Independence Hall to its current nearby home. Many people consider Independence Hall the birthplace of the United States. Both the Declaration of Independence and the U.S. Constitution were signed there. The Liberty Bell cracked the first time it was rung in 1752. However, the bell was rebuilt twice in its early years. The Liberty Bell cracked again sometime between 1817 and 1846. How it cracked remains a mystery. According to one report, its famous split occurred in February 1846 while it was ringing to celebrate George Washington's birthday."	4

Did you know that October is National Childrenâ€™s Magazine Month? In honor of this month, weâ€™ve devoted this article as a guide to understanding the different elements of a news story. 1. The headline is the title of a magazine or newspaper article. It appears in large type to attract attention. Look at the bat story on pages 4 and 5 of this issue. Can you think of a different headline for the story? 2. A deck is often a sentence or phrase that describes the story. It usually appears close to the headline. 3. The first sentence or paragraph of a news story is called the lead. Many writers and editors consider the lead to be the most important part of a story. It is meant to grab peopleâ€™s attention and encourage them to read the article. 4. The body refers to the actual text that makes up a news story. 5. Subheads are like mini headlines that separate a story into sections. 6. Captions describe photographs and artwork. 7. Photographs and artwork help illustrate information from a story. 8. The credit line gives the name of the person or company that supplied the photograph or artwork to a newspaper or magazine. It is usually set in small type at the bottom of a page or next to photos and artwork.	4
"In July, we visited Mystic Aquarium in Connecticut. At the aquarium, we waded in a tank and played with three beluga whales--Inuk, Naku, and Kela. Before we got in the tank, we put on special brown overalls called waders. The waders kept us not only dry but also warm. The water in the beluga tank was about 57 degrees Fahrenheit. The temperature is kept low because, in the wild, beluga whales live in icy waters around the North Pole. In the ocean, these playful white and gray whales often swim in pods, or small groups. Boris, the whalesâ€™ trainer, told us that belugas are social, or friendly, animals that enjoy being touched. The belugas hugged us, splashed us, and even gave us high-fives with their flippers! Boris showed us how the beluga whales respond to different hand signals and touches. He said it takes a few days to teach a beluga a skill like waving its flipper and up to a year to teach a more complicated skill, such as jumping out of the water. When the belugas followed directions, Boris rewarded them with squid and herring. Those are part of a belugaâ€™s diet in the wild. We playfully clapped the belugasâ€™ tongues. Belugas donâ€™t use their teeth to chew food. They swallow their food whole. Although they donâ€™t look like birds, belugas are often called ""sea canaries."" That is because a beluga makes various noises and ""talks"" to other belugas. It does that by producing different sounds, including squeals and whistles, from the blowhole on the top of its head. A beluga also breathes through its blowhole. Naku made different noises from her blowhole, based on how her skin was tapped. To see more pictures from our trip, visit www.weeklyreader.com/kids/grade4/mystic_01.asp."	4
"A group of college students has given new meaning to the words road trip. Beginning in mid-May, the students traveled from the East Coast to the West Coast aboard a bus that left the smell of fries and onion rings in its wake. They weren't riding in an ordinary bus. They were traveling aboard a pollution-free vehicle that used recycled vegetable oil as fuel. Recycling is the process of turning an old item into something new. Vegetable oil from cafeterias and restaurants powered the bus. The students' college in Vermont provided about 200 gallons of vegetable oil to get the bus started. The vegetable oil had been used to fry chicken, potatoes, and other foods served in the cafeteria. As the students traveled across the country, they stopped at fast-food chains instead of gas stations to refuel the bus. About a month later, the students completed their trek in Washington state. They hope to spread a message about protecting the environment. Vegetable oil creates less pollution than diesel fuel, said one of the students. ""It's using some resource that was going to be thrown away and reusing it."""	4
February is time to leap. An extra day of play has been added to the calendar this month.It's leap year! Leap year occurs every four years. That means there is an extra day for VERB. VERB has nothing to do with grammar, so forget about parts of speech. It's a government program that inspires kids to get moving. So... stay active, have fun, spend time with friends and family-do what excites you and what you like to do best. That can mean bike riding with friends, jumping rope, volunteering with your family, or dancing to your favorite tunes. You name it!	4
"If someone tells you that good posture is important, that person is referring to the position of your body when you stand, sit, or walk. Carrying around too much weight in your backpack can force you to bend forward. Slouching over can round your shoulders and cause your upper back to curve. Over time, the extra stress on your back can create posture problems. Some doctors think those problems may lead to neck and back pain. Thirteen children, ages 8 and 9, participated in the backpack study. They walked about 1,130 feet. That is about the average length of a child's walk to school. The kids walked with backpacks that weighed 9 to 13 pounds. The children also walked without backpacks. The study's researchers found that the heavier the backpack load, the more children bent down to support its weight. Afterward, some kids complained that their lower backs and shoulders hurt. Heidi Orloff, one of the researchers, said that she could tell when the backpacks were too heavy or the kids were tired. ""The kids' chins drop to their chests,"" she told Weekly Reader. An estimated 40 million school-age children in the United States use backpacks. Some health groups say that more than half of those students may be carrying backpacks heavy enough to affect their posture. When worn correctly, backpacks have many benefits. They have lots of compartments that help you stay organized. Compared with shoulder bags, backpacks are a better way to carry around the items you need for school. Your body's strongest muscles-in the back and stomach-support the weight of a backpack. A shoulder bag often puts strain unevenly on your body. However, most health experts recommend that kids carry backpacks that are no more than 15 percent of their body weight. That means a 70-pound student should wear a backpack that weighs less than 10 1/2 pounds. Orloff also said that spot checks around the country show that many children are carrying backpacks that weigh between 20 and 25 pounds. Now, that's quite a burden! Below, you'll find some tips to help ease your load. Your back will thank you!"	4
Rescue workers had nursed the whales back to health after the creatures had become stranded in shallow water in April. Their return to the water marked the first time in history that five whales stranded at the same time were returned to the ocean together. Using a crane, volunteers lowered the whales headfirst into the water. The whales had been fitted with special devices for scientists to track their progress. As the whales swam away, many volunteers cheered. Some were moved to tears. Later in the day, people in a helicopter spotted the whales swimming together. Rescuers hoped that the five would join a larger group of nearby whales.	4

"The government in Iraq has started the process of choosing leaders and drafting a constitution, now that the election is over. On January 30, millions of Iraqis voted, braving violence and threats of attack in the country's first national election in 50 years. On that historic day, voters elected 275 leaders to the National Assembly, Iraq's lawmaking body. The assembly recently chose a president and two vice presidents. At press time, those leaders were selecting a prime minister, the most powerful position in Iraq. Bringing peace and lasting democracy to Iraq will be a challenge for the country's temporary government. Different ethnic and religious groups in Iraq want a voice in the government. The assembly is made up of three groups: Shiites (SHEE-ights), Sunnis (SOON-eez), and Kurds. The majority of Iraqis are Muslims, who practice the religion Islam. The Muslims are divided into two groups—Shiites and Sunnis. The two groups have a long history of tension. Most Muslims in Iraq are Shiites, but the Sunnis were in control when the former dictator Saddam Hussein was in power. Many Sunnis did not vote in the recent election as a way to boycott, or protest, Iraq's government. Shiites hold the most seats in the National Assembly, and a Shiite leader is expected to be named prime minister. A Kurdish leader was elected as the nation's president. Both a Shiite and a Sunni were elected as vice presidents. Despite the challenges, United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan called the first meeting of the assembly ""an important step"" for Iraq. The assembly's main task is to write a new constitution by August 15. Once that is approved by the Iraqis, a permanent government will be elected."	4
"Rescue workers, military, and government agencies from around the world have been delivering food, clean water, and other much-needed supplies to South Asia. They are helping the victims of the devastating tsunami (soo-NAH-mee) that destroyed the area more than a month ago. This map shows the countries in South Asia and East Africa where the tsunami hit. They are shown in yellow. Getting aid to the region has been difficult. In places where roads and runways have been washed away, supplies are being dropped from helicopters. In India and Thailand, even elephants are helping clear the rubble. 1. A tsunami usually occurs when an earthquake or volcanic eruption takes place underwater. 2. Large waves move outward from the epicenter, or the earthquake's center. 3. As a tsunami nears land, the waves decrease in speed but increase in size. 4. Huge waves crash against the coast. The recent tsunami created waves up to 20 feet high--about the height of a two-story building. A tsunami is a series of huge waves usually caused by an underwater earthquake or volcanic eruption. The word tsunami means ""harbor wave"" in Japanese. The world's most powerful earthquake in 40 years set off the recent tsunami. The quake occurred beneath the Indian Ocean, off the island of Sumatra in Indonesia. Waves smashed against the coastlines of 12 countries in South Asia and East Africa. The waves raced across the ocean at speeds of up to 500 miles per hour. That is about as fast as an airplane travels. The tsunami destroyed almost everything and everyone in its path when it crashed against land. Massive waves swept people on beaches out to sea and destroyed entire fishing villages. At the time Weekly Reader went to press, more than 150,000 people had died as a result of the tsunami. The death tolls were highest in Indonesia, Sri Lanka, India, and Thailand. Millions of people were left homeless. President George W. Bush described the tragedy as ""one of the worst natural disasters in history."" Many of the victims were children, who could not survive the fury of the waves. Health workers fear that the spread of diseases could cause the death toll to increase. Diseases spread when the water supply gets contaminated, or polluted. World leaders are focusing on providing long-term aid to the affected areas. That includes helping people rebuild their homes, their lives, and their businesses. Officials predict that it could take up to a decade to recover from the tsunami. Governments have promised more than $3 billion in aid. ""The world is coming together in a manner we have never ever seen before,"" said United Nations official Jan Egeland. It's not just governments helping out. People are making a difference in ways large and small, with companies donating millions of dollars and kids organizing bake sales to raise money. Officials say an early warning system could have saved thousands of lives. A warning system was established in 1965 for countries that border the Pacific Ocean. The United States is part of that system. Because tsunamis are rare in the Indian Ocean, countries in that area did not have a warning system. World leaders are working to create a system that will warn and help protect people in all countries."	4
Are you ready to take a ride on The Polar Express? This new movie is about a boy who boards a magical train to the North Pole. The Polar Express is based on the classic children's book by Chris Van Allsburg. To make the book into a movie, filmmakers used a new type of technology called performance capture. Weekly Reader (WR) spoke to Douglas Chiang about his work on The Polar Express. Chiang created the artwork for the movie to capture the feeling of the book. WR: What does a production designer do? Douglas Chiang: I get to play with the visual design of the movie. I read the script, come up with ideas, [draw] them on paper, and show the director. WR: Do you have advice for kids who want a job like yours? DC: Study the basics. You need to learn how to draw properly, then worry about techniques. WR: What is The Polar Express about to you? DC: It's really about believing in yourself and believing that anything is possible. This latest technology helped filmmakers to get the movie to resemble the beautiful paintings in the children's book. How does performance capture work? Tiny sensors, which look like mini jewels, captured the actors' movements. Actor Tom Hanks performed with 150 sensors attached to his face. He also wore special body gear with more sensors. Hanks acted on a stage that resembled the inside of a black box. While Hanks acted inside the black box, special cameras picked up light reflected from the sensors. The cameras then sent the information to computers. Finally, Hanks's performance was placed into a computerized setting of the book. What the audience will see on the screen is part real and part computer animation. The Polar Express is the first movie shot this way. It enabled Hanks to play five characters, including the boy and the conductor!	4
"U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service The bald eagle is flying high! This majestic bird has clawed its way back from the edge of extinction, or dying out. About 40 years ago, the number of bald eagles in the United States was declining rapidly. Today, however, the bald eagle is returning to the skies. Wildlife officials hope to remove the bird from the list of threatened species by the end of the year. In the early 1700s, bald eagles were a common sight. There were about half a million of those birds living in the United States. Over time, their population fell dramatically. In the early 1960s, very few bald eagles remained. What caused the number to drop? Hunting and the use of harmful chemicals sprayed on crops were largely to blame. Those chemicals poisoned the birds and their eggs. Pollution also contributed to the problem. Bald eagles often became sick after eating fish from polluted waters. In addition, the bald eagles' habitat was being destroyed as people cut down trees to build roads and homes. A habitat is a place in nature where an animal makes its home. Although some threats still exist, the future looks hopeful for bald eagles. Today, there are about 20,000 bald eagles living in the United States. Thanks to laws that helped protect bald eagles and banned harmful chemicals, the birds are making a comeback. Conservation, or protection, efforts have helped their survival. ""There is no doubt that it is the single best conservation story the United States has had,"" bald eagle expert Bryan Watts told Weekly Reader. In 1782, the bald eagle was made the national bird of the United States. The nation's founders chose the bird because it symbolized freedom, strength, and courage. At the time, some people disagreed about the choice for the national bird. Benjamin Franklin, for example, thought the turkey would make a better choice because it was ""a much more respectable bird."""	4
"It is turning out to be a colorful election year--even crayons are getting in on the action. In honor of the election, Crayola crayons are being named after states! Kids from across the country were asked to ""nominate"" a crayon color and give it a new name related to their state. Many of the new crayon names were based on famous landmarks, people, historical events, and state symbols. The winning names will be unveiled in a new crayon box before Election Day. Weekly Reader was given a sneak preview. The winning crayon name for Texas--the state where George W. Bush served as governor before becoming president--is Alamo a la mode. Kyle Schmitt, 6, named the crayon after the Texas landmark the Alamo and the state's famous Blue Bell creameries. The new name will appear on the blue bell crayon. President Bush will be pleased because blue bell is his favorite Crayola color. It reminds him of the bluebonnet, the state flower of Texas. Jessica Zeliger, 5, was the lucky winner from Massachusetts. That is the state where John Kerry is a U.S. senator. She honored her state with the name Boston Tea Party. The new name will appear on the burnt sienna crayon."	4
"Hours before giant waves pounded coastlines in South Asia, many animals started behaving strangely. In Sri Lanka, elephants trumpeted frantically and fled to higher ground. Bats and flamingos deserted low-lying areas. Many other animals escaped unharmed. Wildlife experts are amazed that many animals survived the tsunami. The series of huge waves killed thousands of people in South Asia and East Africa about two months ago. Experts say animals might have sensed the approaching waves and moved to higher ground. ""I think animals can sense disaster. They know when things are happening in nature,"" said an official at the national wildlife department in Sri Lanka. Other stories of odd animal behavior before the tsunami have also surfaced. Giant waves flooded low-lying parts of Yala National Park in Sri Lanka, uprooting trees and killing hundreds of people. Wildlife officials reported, however, that few animals died. The park is home to hundreds of animals, including elephants, monkeys, leopards, tigers, deer, and water buffalo. In Thailand, elephants carrying tourists from Japan bolted for the hills, and other elephants broke free of their chains. In one fishing village, nearly 1,000 locals escaped safely after birds squawked madly. Although some animals in South Asia successfully fled to higher ground before the tsunami, other animals were not as lucky. Many dogs and other pets lost their owners in the tsunami and are homeless, sick, and without food or water. Cows, goats, and other farm animals are also roaming aimlessly. Many of those animals are drinking polluted water. Rescue groups have been sending animal food and veterinarians to the area. Veterinarians are doctors who care for animals. Why might animals have known trouble was on the way? Forget special powers. Instead, experts say that animals have better senses of hearing, smell, and sight than humans do. Those sharp senses help warn animals when natural disasters, such as volcanic eruptions or earthquakes, are about to happen. ""It doesn't surprise me that animals had an early warning of the tsunami,"" animal expert Michael Dee of the Los Angeles Zoo told Weekly Reader. ""The senses of certain species are far stronger than what any human has."" Dee points out that dogs, for example, have a stronger sense of smell than humans and that cats can see better in the dark than people. Scientists say that animals might have felt the vibrations from the earthquake that set off the tsunami. In addition, many animals, including elephants, pigeons, and dogs, can also pick up infrasound. That is a sound that is too low in pitch for humans to hear. ""Elephants can hear or feel other elephants grumble up to 2 miles away, so they probably felt the earthquake,"" said Dee. ""Their first instinct would be to move away from the direction of the sound."" An instinct is a natural, untaught behavior or reaction. Before the tsunami struck, animals may have started to flee because they saw other creatures running. ""Animals take their cues from other animals,"" said Dee. How animals sense danger has fascinated people for centuries. Most scientists are quick to point out, however, that nothing has ever been proven. Will animal instincts be used to create a warning system about natural disasters anytime soon? ""I wouldn't count on [it],"" said Dee. In the meantime, animals are helping out in other ways. For example, elephants are assisting in the cleanup of areas hit by the tsunami. Elephants' soles have sensitive foot pads that detect vibrations, such as those from an earthquake. That signals elephants to move to more stable ground."	4
"To be elected president, a person must meet three requirements. According to the U.S. Constitution, a person must be a citizen born in the United States, be at least 35 years old, and have lived in the United States for at least 14 years. Some people think that immigrants should be able to run for president. Immigrants are people who move to a country from another country. Supporters want a 28th Amendment added to the Constitution that would allow immigrants to become president if they have been U.S. citizens for at least 20 years. Amending, or legally changing, the Constitution is no easy task. Since the Bill of Rights was added in 1791, the Constitution has changed only 17 times. The Bill of Rights is the first 10 Amendments to the Constitution. Those amendments outline the basic freedoms of Americans. At the center of the debate is Arnold Schwarzenegger. The former actor was elected governor of California in 2003. Schwarzenegger was born in Austria, a country in Europe. He became a U.S. citizen in 1983. The Constitution blocks him and the nearly 13 million foreign-born citizens in the United States from the Oval Office. People who support a change to the amendment say the Constitution denies foreign-born American citizens equal rights. They argue that 60,000 immigrants currently serve in the U.S. military. Supporters also say that the Constitution has been amended in the past. Amendments to outlaw slavery, give women the right to vote, and limit a president to two terms in office were added. Others say that the requirement is unfair, especially because the United States is supposed to be the land of opportunity. ""You cannot choose the land of your birth,"" said an advocate in a television ad. ""You can choose the land you love."" Others argue that people born in foreign countries should not be allowed to run for president because it can cause conflict. They think that those people may have allegiance, or loyalty, to a country other than the United States. Many historians say that the nation's founders included the requirement for a reason. The founders feared that foreign countries could influence a leader's loyalty. ""I don't think it's unfair to say the president of the United States should be a native-born citizen,"" said Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein of California. ""Your [loyalty to your country] is driven by your birth."""	4
"Is Atlantis a myth? For centuries, people have wondered whether this legendary land really existed. A myth is a made-up tale that is often accepted as truth. Now an American scientist claims he has discovered the remains of Atlantis on the bottom of the Mediterranean Sea. According to the age-old myth, Atlantis was a place of great wealth. The ancient kingdom gleamed with gold and silver and was a center for art and learning. Over time, the people there became corrupt and greedy. As punishment, the gods unleashed powerful earthquakes and floods that swallowed up Atlantis and sank it to the ocean floor. The only account of this legendary lost land comes from the long-ago writings of Plato. He was an ancient Greek writer who lived about 2,500 years ago. People don't know how much of Plato's text is factual, because he wrote about an event that had happened 9,000 years before his time. Robert Sarmast, the American scientist behind the recent claim, performed sonar tests of the Mediterranean seafloor. Sonar tests use sound waves to find underwater objects. Sarmast says his tests revealed human-made walls and structures that matched Plato's description. ""If you compare [my findings to Plato's description], you will be astonished,"" Sarmast told reporters. ""We hope that future expeditions will bring back physical proof."" A scientist from Germany says the newly found ruins are underwater volcanoes that spewed mud, not the remains of Atlantis. Other scientists say the only location for Atlantis was Plato's imagination. Government officials in Cyprus are also skeptical, or unsure, that the remains are those of Atlantis. Sarmast and his team are not the first researchers to believe that they have discovered the submerged, or sunken, land. Some of those explorers have placed it off Spain's coast, near Cuba, southwest of England, and in the South China Sea. Plato wrote about Atlantis as an island in the western sea. Many people believe that location meant the Atlantic Ocean. Another theory, or idea, is that the story of Atlantis refers to the ancient Minoan (mih-NOH-ehn) people. They lived on the islands of Crete and Thira, between Greece and Turkey. That civilization disappeared following volcanic eruptions and earthquakes. Plato might have based his writings on that event. Even today, the mystery of Atlantis grows stronger and continues to captivate, or fascinate, people."	4
"Twelve-year-old Sydney Davis is riding the wristband wave. Inspired by the popular yellow wristbands introduced by champion cyclist Lance Armstrong to raise money for cancer research, Sydney had her own idea. ""I thought, 'Why can't we have one for diabetes?' "" she told Weekly Reader. Sydney has had diabetes since she was in kindergarten. She is one of 18 million people in the United States with this disease. In a person with diabetes, the body makes little or no insulin. That is a substance that the body needs to help convert glucose, a sugar in food, into energy. The two friends started selling the wristbands in their New Jersey community to raise money for research aimed at curing diabetes. After only a month, they had sold 10,000 bracelets and donated the contributions to the Naomi Berrie Diabetes Center in New York City. The bracelets were in such high demand that the diabetes center began selling them on its Web site. ""We made over $100,000 already!"" said Sydney."	4
"Do you skip breakfast most mornings? If you're like most kids, you probably do! A new school year can be a good time to get into the habit of eating a healthful breakfast, say experts. Recent studies show that eating breakfast boosts both your health and your brainpower. Nutrients are substances found in food that help your body stay strong and healthy. Eating a healthful breakfast and a balanced diet during the day will help your body get the nutrients it needs. The old saying is true-you are what you eat! That's because your health depends on what you put into your body. Here are some nutrients you might find in breakfast foods: Did you know that the word breakfast means ""break the fast""? While you're asleep at night, you're fasting, or not eating. You ""break the fast"" when you eat a morning meal. Breakfast replenishes, or restores, the energy that is lost after a night's sleep. That is why it is often called the most important meal of the day. Studies show that kids who eat a healthful breakfast learn better, pay more attention in class, and are less likely to miss school. Experts also say that kids who eat breakfast are less likely to overeat later in the day. That is good news. Along with regular exercise, eating breakfast can lower the risk of becoming obese, or severely overweight. About 9 million kids in the United States are obese. Being overweight can lead to health problems, such as heart disease, later in life. No time for waffles or pancakes in the morning? Don't worry! We have some quick and easy tips for a healthful breakfast: Breakfast eaters also have another reason to smile. Eating breakfast in the morning helps keep tooth decay at bay. A new study found that kids who do not eat breakfast are more likely to have tooth decay than kids who do. Why? Kids who skip breakfast tend to reach for sugary snacks during the day. Experts say that if you find yourself crunched for time in the morning, don't rule out breakfast. Being creative with your morning routine can help you make time. You might try planning your outfit the night before or getting up 10 minutes early. Some families even set the breakfast table before going to bed. Leaving time for breakfast will give you the brainpower you need in school and will keep you going until the lunch bell rings. ""Breakfast really helps to start your engine!"" says Campbell."	4
"Mark your calendar! The final countdown to Election Day has begun. On November 2, millions of Americans will head to the polls to vote for the next president of the United States. The race to the White House is long and hard, but the finish line is in sight for President George W. Bush and Senator John Kerry. As Election Day draws close, the candidates are busy campaigning, or trying to win votes. Each of the candidates for president belongs to a political party. That isn't a party with cake and balloons--although each candidate hopes to be celebrating with a victory on Election Day. A political party is a group of people who have the same ideas about how to run the country. There are two main political parties in the United States: the Republican Party and the Democratic Party. Sometimes, candidates run for president without the support of the two main parties. They are called independents. Bush, the 43rd president, is the Republican candidate who wants to be reelected. His running mate is Vice President Richard Cheney. John Kerry, a U.S. senator from Massachusetts, is the Democratic candidate running against Bush. His running mate for vice president is John Edwards, a U.S. senator from North Carolina. With Election Day just weeks away, the presidential candidates are crisscrossing the country on the campaign trail to get their messages out. They are meeting voters, giving speeches, and telling people why they think they are best qualified to lead the country. The candidates are also speaking out about important issues, or problems, that our country faces. Some of those issues include rebuilding Iraq, protecting the environment, and improving schools. Political polls predict that the 2004 presidential election will be a close race. The candidates know that every vote will count. ""I want to be your president for four more years,"" Bush said in a speech on the campaign trail. ""From creating jobs to improving our schools, from fighting terror to spreading the peace, we made much progress, and there is more to do."" Those issues are important to Kerry too. ""You meet incredible people, and you want to make their lives better,"" said Kerry. ""They tell you about their lives--their schools, the cost of health care, or their sons and daughters serving in Iraq. It's a huge sense of responsibility and a daily reminder of why elections are so important."" Who will be the best person for the job? The American people will decide on Election Day. Winning the presidential election tops the list of George W. Bush and John Kerry these days, but that wasn't always the case. Both candidates dreamed of being sports stars as kids. President Bush was born in New Haven, Connecticut, on July 6, 1946. His family moved to Texas not long after he was born. As a child, Bush dreamed of becoming a baseball player. One of his hobbies was collecting baseball cards. When he was 10 years old, Bush used to mail cards to famous baseball players to have them autographed and returned to him. Before being elected president in 2000, Bush was a part owner of the Texas Rangers baseball team. He also served as governor of Texas for six years. Senator Kerry was born in Denver, Colorado, on December 11, 1943. His family moved to Massachusetts a few months after he was born. As a child, Kerry wanted to become a hockey player and even thought about becoming a football player. His interest in sports continued through the years. He played hockey, soccer, and lacrosse in college. As he grew up, Kerry began to think about public service. Before serving as a Massachusetts senator for the past 20 years, Kerry was the lieutenant governor of that state for two years. Did you know that animals represent the two main political groups in the United States? Thomas Nast, a political cartoonist, first used the animals as symbols in the late 1800s. The elephant is the symbol for the Republican Party. The donkey is the symbol for the Democratic Party."	4
A strong earthquake recently shook the ground in California. The level 6 quake rattled people's nerves even though it didn't cause a lot of damage or injuries. It only broke some water pipes and knocked down a few objects. Earthquakes above 4 on the Richter scale are major. The Richter scale measures the strength of an earthquake on a scale of 0 to 8 and above. The recent earthquake was centered outside the town of Parkfield in northern California. That small town is known as the earthquake capital of the state. Earthquakes happen when plates, or large sections of Earth's crust, move. Most quakes happen near faults, or the edges of the plates. The town of Parkfield is located on one of the world's most active faults. It is called the San Andreas Fault. Parkfield has so many quakes that earthquake scientists called seismologists have set up special equipment to study the area. Seismologists are unsure whether Earth sends signals that indicate if an earthquake is on its way. They hope their project will help them find clues, if they exist, to predict future quakes and prevent injuries and damage.	4
"Does thinking about spiders and their hairy bodies, long legs, and sticky webs make your skin crawl? Many people shiver at the thought of spiders. That is not the case for Rich Bradley, a real-life Spider-Man. He can't get enough of the creepy crawlers. Bradley is an arachnologist (ah-rak-NAH-luh-jist). That is a scientist who studies spiders. Bradley has spent the last 10 years identifying and studying spiders in his home state of Ohio. So far, Bradley has uncovered 583 species, or types, of spiders living in the Buckeye State. He and his team of volunteers have a sharp eye when it comes to collecting the creatures indoors and outdoors. ""They move really fast,"" he told Weekly Reader. Scientists say about 3,500 species of spiders live in North America, and nearly 35,000 live worldwide. Spiders live in different places, including gardens, water, deserts, and caves. Many people think spiders are insects, but they are actually arachnids (ah-RAK-nidz). Ticks and scorpions are also arachnids. Along with fangs and eight hairy legs, a spider has two body parts--a head and an abdomen. The abdomen contains spinnerets, organs that produce silk. A spider uses its silk for many purposes, including weaving webs, protecting its eggs, and catching food. Spiders are predators, or hunters that eat other animals. They dine mostly on insects. Some larger spiders also eat lizards, frogs, and even snakes. To capture their food, some spiders spin webs. Other types of spiders chase down their prey. The venom, or poison, from their fangs helps paralyze their food. Although the hairy creatures spook many people, there isn't much reason to be afraid of spiders. ""Most spiders are not very dangerous,"" said Bradley. In fact, most are timid creatures that are unable to give humans more than a harmless bite. Although spider venom is deadly to insects, it often has little effect on humans because of our larger size. Spiders may have a bad reputation for being scary, but they are important to us. Bradley hopes his work shatters some myths about spiders. (A myth is a false idea that many people believe is true.) Spiders eat mosquitoes and other insects that harm farmers' crops and carry diseases. Bradley's research is teaching scientists more about how spiders help control ecosystems, or communities of plants and animals. If spiders didn't exist, there would be a lot more insects! ""Spiders are your friends,"" Bradley said. ""They make our life more pleasant."" Get caught up on some different types of spiders. Spiders come in all shapes and sizes. Crab spiders, jumping spiders, and orb weavers have made Rich Bradley's Ohio count. Find out more about them and other spiders. What other animals frighten people but are good for the environment? In what ways are they good for the environment?"	4
"Nine-year-old Ben Duskin is reaching out to kids who have a serious disease called cancer. Ben invented a video game for kids about fighting cancer. Ben, who is from California, is no stranger to the disease. He learned that he had a type of cancer called leukemia when he was five years old. Why did Ben invent the video game? When he was in the hospital, he relied on video games to take his mind off being sick. That inspired him to help other kids who have cancer. The result is ""Ben's Game""--named after its creator. The game takes place inside the body and stars a boy hero who moves around the screen on a skateboard. The boy is modeled after Ben. The object of the game is to blast cancer cells. Thanks to the Make-A-Wish Foundation, Ben's idea became a reality. The foundation helped Ben work with a software designer to create his video game. Ben's game is now available free online.

Wind can help fly a kite, power a sailboat, or spread seeds. Around the world, wind has also become an increasingly popular and inexpensive source of energy that is converted into electricity. At the National Wind Technology Center in Colorado, scientists are working to advance wind-power technology. Wind is often considered an environmentally friendly source of power. Wind doesn't pollute the environment and is a renewable source of energy that can't be used up like fossil fuels, such as coal, oil, and natural gas. Harnessing power from wind is nothing new. Some of the first windmills were used in Europe more than 5,000 years ago. Today, modern windmills, called turbines, resemble airplane propellers and are grouped together in wind farms. Despite the benefits, wind power is far from perfect. Opponents of wind farms say the biggest problem is unreliability—when the wind doesn't blow, there is no power. They also argue that wind turbines can be an eyesore and threaten birds and other wildlife that fly into the blades. Currently, 27 states have wind farms. Those turbines provide enough power for more than a million homes.	4
"A woman who kicked off the environmental conference knows a thing or two about chimps. Jane Goodall is a scientist who is famous for her research in Africa on how chimpanzees behave in the wild. Goodall gave a speech to kids about making the world a better place. She even introduced herself with chimpanzee noises! What advice did she have for kids about protecting the environment? ""Get involved and do something!"" Today, Jane Goodall works for the United Nations. She travels around the world and speaks about the environment and peace. Goodall credits her mom for being her greatest inspiration to study chimpanzees. ""When I dreamed of going to Africa at 8, everybody laughed at me,"" she told Weekly Reader. ""[My mom] was the one who said that if you really want something, work hard, take advantage of the opportunity, and never give up!"""	4
"Christian Atayde Stoinev was just 3 years old when he began performing in his family's circus in Mexico. Today, at 13, Christian performs in about 350 shows a year for the Big Apple Circus. The Big Apple Circus is based in New York City but visits 10 other cities each year. ""I was born into the circus,"" Christian told Weekly Reader. He's not kidding. His father is an acrobat from Bulgaria, a country in Europe. His mother is a trapeze artist from Mexico, where her family owns that country's largest circus. Both parents now work behind the scenes at the Big Apple Circus. A talented gymnast and an acrobat, Christian can do flips on and off a trampoline. He can balance on one hand, ride a unicycle, and dance. He is also working on a routine with his 18-month-old dog--a Chihuahua named Scooby. The eighth grader attends school three hours each morning at the One-Ring School House run by the circus. Christian lives on the circus grounds and shares a large trailer with his parents, his younger brother, and Scooby."	4

"The United States has a ""big"" problem. People are gaining weight—and they are getting larger at an alarming rate. According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, approximately 59 million adults in the United States are obese, or severely overweight. It's not just adults who have expanding waistlines. Over the past 20 years, the percentage of overweight kids in the United States has doubled. About 15 percent, or 9 million kids, are overweight today. That is one out of every six kids. Being overweight can lead to serious health problems, such as heart disease and diabetes, later in life. ""Obesity ... is now the most serious dietary problem affecting the health of American children,"" said nutrition expert Marion Nestle. So why are so many people packing on the pounds? People gain weight when they take in more calories than they use up through activity. A calorie is a measure of the amount of energy from food. Exercise burns calories, but kids today aren't moving as much as kids did in the past. Studies show that kids spend more time than ever before watching television, playing video games, and sitting at computers. Some schools have also dropped recess in favor of more classroom time. Other schools have cut back on their physical education programs. At the same time, portions at many fast-food restaurants have become supersized. In 1957, the average hamburger weighed 1 ounce and had 210 calories. Today, it has grown to 6 ounces and contains 618 calories. Many people can't resist the larger portion sizes and have included more fries, burgers, and other fast foods in their diets. On average, it is estimated that an American kid eats a fast-food meal once every three days. Megameals can't take all the blame. Each year, kids are exposed to more than 10,000 television ads for candy, soft drinks, and other sugary snacks. Very few television ads promote healthful foods, such as fruits and vegetables. To help fight the problem, the U.S. government recently issued new guidelines for healthful eating. The guidelines recommend that kids exercise for at least 60 minutes a day and eat more fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. Parents, schools, and health officials are also helping kids battle the bulge. Even some fast-food restaurants are working to make their meals more healthful. Schools in California, Texas, and New York toughened their junk food policies. They have banned soft drinks and other junk food. Candy and other sugary snacks in school vending machines are being replaced with more healthful choices, such as nuts, bottled water, and granola bars. Schools are also reworking their lunch programs to include more fruits and vegetables. In addition, some schools are motivating couch potatoes to get up and move. Those schools are finding new ways of encouraging physical activity in students. In Hortonville, Wisconsin, gym classes are teaching kids that exercise can be fun. Kids go in-line skating and dance to videos. One Hortonville school has even raised money for a rock-climbing wall. Are these fun programs working? Eleven-year-old Logan Beck from Wisconsin thinks so. He says that the mix of fun things makes him ""more active."" Ten-year-old Thailee Tran of Fort Worth, Texas, recently enjoyed a ""peanut butter"" and jelly sandwich made with a sunflower seed spread instead of peanut butter. Fourth grader Paige Murset gave a sweet potato pancake a thumbs up. ""I like it,"" she said. ""It's really sweet."" Thailee and Paige are among 40 fourth and fifth graders at Meadowbrook Elementary School who taste-tested foods such as blueberry burgers, dried plum barbecue sauce, and asparagus salsa. The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) conducted the taste test. It was part of a national school lunch event. USDA officials are encouraging schools to find creative ways to add more fruits and vegetables to lunches. The kids' opinions from the taste test carry weight. If kids like the new healthful lunch options, the foods might be added to school cafeteria menus across the country. ""It [will] be up to the students and the schools whether they'll see [these food items] on their menus,"" said John Lund, an official with the USDA. What are some messages of junk food advertisements? How do they try to persuade kids to eat those foods?"	4
"An ancient mystery lurks beneath the coffin of King Tutankhamen (too-tahng-KAH-men). Researchers are trying to determine whether a horrible crime thousands of years ago led to the young Egyptian king's death. Did someone murder a boy called King Tut? In an attempt to solve the mystery, scientists are X-raying the mummy of the pharaoh. A pharaoh refers to an ancient Egyptian king. King Tut lived in Egypt more than 3,300 years ago. Despite suffering from a spine disease that made it difficult for him to turn his head, Tut probably spent his childhood swimming in the Nile River, hunting ducks, and learning how to read and write. After his father died, the young boy was thrown into the royal spotlight. Tut was crowned king at about the age of 10! His reign, however, did not last very long. By 18 years old, he was dead. The mystery of how King Tut died has fascinated people since Howard Carter, a British archaeologist, found his secret tomb in 1922. A tomb is a burial place. Ancient Egyptians buried King Tut in an area of hidden caves called the Valley of the Kings. It is located near the Nile River. Tut's mummy was discovered with an elaborate gold mask covering its head and shoulders. The tomb was filled with royal treasures, including jewelry, statues, furniture, and even some of Tut's childhood toys. Ancient Egyptians believed in life after death. They buried their dead with favorite items they believed could be used in the afterlife. If Tut was murdered, crime experts believe the culprit was likely someone close to him. Scientists have narrowed the list to four suspects: his wife, his treasurer, his prime minister, and his military chief. They suspect those four people because they would have known about Tut's spine disease. His weak condition would have made him an easy target. They also might have had motives, or reasons, to murder Tut. (See ""Prime Suspects."") Why do scientists think Tut was killed? They say the tomb's small size and its rushed state hint that he might have died unexpectedly. At the time of the tomb's discovery in 1922, experts had ruled out foul play. Yet X-rays taken in 1968 revealed a different story. They showed a hole in Tut's skull, suggesting he might have suffered a severe blow to the head. Tut's mummy was flown to the Egyptian Museum in Cairo for new X-rays. X-ray technology today is more sophisticated than it was in 1968. Thanks to modern forensics, or crime-solving techniques, scientists hope the question of whether Tut was murdered will soon be answered. Was a crime committed? Clues point to four main suspects. The Wife (Ankhesenamen)Although paintings in Tut's tomb depict a loving wife, experts say she could still have had a motive. Shortly after Tut died, his wife wrote a letter to the leader of another nation. She requested help in finding a new husband. In ancient Egypt, it was possible for women to become pharaohs. Did she murder her husband to become pharaoh herself? The Treasurer (Maya)Tut's treasurer, Maya, had easy access to him during his reign. Evidence, however, shows that Maya liked the boy king. He rebuilt Tut's burial chamber after it was robbed. A gift in Tut's tomb also bears Maya's name. Although Maya was the least likely to ascend to the throne after Tut's death, could the treasurer have been so jealous of the boy king that he murdered him? The Prime Minister (Ay)Ay was Tut's adviser and grandfather. He became pharaoh upon Tut's death. After Tut died, Ay pressured Tut's wife to marry him. Marrying her made him king of Egypt. Shortly after their wedding, the new bride mysteriously disappeared. Some people think a painting of a hunting scene in Ay's tomb proves his crime. The painting was an odd choice for a royal tomb. Was Ay confessing his crime through the killing in the painting? The Military Chief (Horemheb)War threatened Egypt during Tut's rule. His military chief might have thought the boy king was too young to protect Egypt from its enemies. Because the chief drove Tut's chariot, some experts suspect that he pushed the young pharaoh to his death. After the prime minister's death, the military chief became king of Egypt. At that time, he attempted to erase records of Tut's life. Could that have been to cover up a crime? Be the crime expert. Whom would you arrest for murder?

"This spring, David Jourdan and a team of explorers will search the floor of the Pacific Ocean for an old airplane. Their expedition, or voyage, will concentrate on an area west of Howland Island. The tiny island is located roughly halfway between Australia and Hawaii. The explorers are trying to solve one of history's greatest mysteries—what ever happened to Amelia Earhart? Amelia Earhart was an aviator, or airplane pilot, who broke many flying records during the 1930s. In 1932, she became the first woman to fly alone across the Atlantic Ocean. In 1937, Earhart attempted to become the first woman to fly an airplane around the world. During that historic trip, she and her navigator, or guide, Fred Noonan, vanished forever. They were scheduled to land on Howland Island in the Pacific. After their disappearance, the U.S. government launched a search, but no trace of the plane was found. Some people think Earhart's plane ran out of gas and crashed into the Pacific Ocean. Others believe she may have crash-landed on a deserted island and was never rescued. Jourdan is confident that his team will find Earhart's plane. ""Our expectation is the plane will be largely, if not completely, intact,"" he said. The explorers will use sonar to search the ocean floor. Sonar sends out sound waves, which bounce off underwater objects. Over the years, many unsuccessful attempts have been made to solve Earhart's mystery. Despite the uncertainty, Earhart will be remembered as a pioneer of aviation and a fearless flier."	4
"Election fever hit more than the United States this year. People in Afghanistan elected a president for the first time in their country's history in early October. Afghanistan is a landlocked country located in southwestern Asia. Many people braved long lines and snow and rain to cast their votes. Not even the threat of violence deterred, or prevented, them from voting. More than 8 million of 10.5 million registered voters cast ballots. About 850,000 Afghan refugees living in Pakistan and Iran also voted. Refugees are people who are forced to leave their homelands because of war. Afghans consider the election an important step in working toward democracy. A democracy is a type of government in which people vote for their leaders in elections. The United States is an example of a democracy. Now that the counting is over, Hamid Karzai was declared the official winner, out of eighteen candidates. Karzai will serve a five-year term. He has been the acting president of Afghanistan since the fall of the Taliban three years ago. The Taliban are an extreme religious group that had strict control over Afghanistan from 1996 to 2001. U.S.-led forces removed the Taliban from power for protecting terrorists after September 11. People and religion: Most of the people in Afghanistan are Muslims. They follow the religion of Islam. There are many different groups of people in Afghanistan with their own languages and traditions. The two largest groups are the Pashtuns and the Tajiks. The Pashtuns live in southeast Afghanistan. The Tajiks live in northeast and central Afghanistan. Language: Pashto and Dari are the country's two official languages. The Pashtuns speak Pashto. The Tajiks speak Dari. Despite threats of violence, the Taliban were unable to disrupt the historic election. Afghans hope the election will help bring peace to their war-torn country. ""I came here to elect my president on my own,"" said a voter. Counting, or tallying, the votes did not get under way until several days after the election. It took weeks to tally the votes because the ballots had to be sorted and counted by hand. Boxes of ballots were even carried by donkeys from remote areas to counting centers. There are few roads in Afghanistan's mountainous landscape. The election was not without some turmoil, or confusion, though. Voters' thumbs were marked with a permanent ink to show that they had voted. However, election workers in some polling places used an ink that could be rubbed off. That allowed some people to vote more than once. An independent committee investigated the problem. They determined that the ink problems were too minor to affect the election results. Officials pointed out that a larger victory had been achieved. People had overcome their fear of violence to vote. World leaders praised the election but also voiced caution. A leader from Germany said that it is the beginning of ""a surely long path into democracy."" Do you think democratic elections are important? Why or why not?"	4
"Heather Lindaman from upstate New York won't be playing dodgeball anytime soon. In 2001, Heather, then 7 years old, was playing dodgeball in gym class when she fell, slamming into a hardwood floor and breaking her elbow. After Heather's injury, her parents brought a case to court against the school. They argued that dodgeball is too dangerous for young kids to play in school. A New York court is currently hearing the case. Based on the court's decision, the school may decide whether the game should be banned, or not allowed. To play dodgeball, one team's members must hit opposing players with a large rubber ball to eliminate them from the game. The team with players left in the game wins. Some schools in Massachusetts, Maine, Maryland, New York, Virginia, Texas, and Utah have already banned dodgeball or versions of the game. Some of those versions include war ball, monster ball, and kill game. The National Association for Sport and Physical Education agrees that dodgeball does not belong in schools. That organization is made up of 20,000 gym teachers, coaches, and trainers. ""Dodgeball is not an appropriate activity for K-12 school physical education programs,"" the group told reporters. Members of the association argue that dodgeball promotes violence and is unfair. They say that the game encourages bullying because stronger kids target weaker ones. Don't toss dodgeball to the sidelines, say others. Nick Troy is a director with the National Amateur Dodgeball Association. Although his group is not connected with schools, he points out that the game has benefits. ""Dodgeball develops hand-eye coordination, strengthens muscles, and builds concentration skills,"" Troy told Weekly Reader. ""It is also a good form of exercise."" Troy and others argue that dodgeball is no more dangerous than other school sports that kids play. Troy also disagrees that smaller kids are at a disadvantage. ""The goal isn't necessarily to get the weakest player out,"" he said. ""It's to get the best player out."""	4
"The musicians are traveling from coast to coast in a shuttle bus to spread their message. Their vehicle is attracting a lot of attention because they aren't cruising in an ordinary bus. The group is traveling aboard a ""veggie mobile,"" which is leaving the scent of fried food in the air. The pollution-free bus uses recycled vegetable oil as fuel. (When something is recycled, an old item is turned into something new.) The veggie mobile is meant to inspire people to make their voices heard on Election Day. Ezra Gale, one of the cofounders of the bus's mission, told USA Today, ""Our message is really simple. If everyone just voted, [it would] be a better country."" Who can vote on Election Day? To cast a ballot, a person must be at least 18 years old, a U.S. citizen, and registered (signed up) to vote."	4
"When you read a newspaper, do you usually open it to the comics section? Many people do! That's because those cartoons are funny. The cartoons in the comics section may make you laugh, but another type of cartoon will also make you think. It's called an editorial cartoon. An editorial cartoon expresses an opinion about specific people or events in the news. Lately, many editorial cartoonists have been focusing on the presidential candidates and the election. Artist Gary Markstein created two political illustrations to express his opinions about this year's election. The economy is one of the main issues in this year's presidential election. (The economy refers to the way a country runs its jobs and industries.) The economy is like the weather--sometimes it's good, and other times it's bad. Political polls show that many people ""vote with their pocketbook."" That is, they vote based on how the economy is doing. Markstein uses symbols to make his point about the economy. Symbols are objects that represent other things. One cartoon shows two weather maps labeled ""Economy."" George W. Bush stands in front of a weather map covered with smiling faces. John Kerry holds an umbrella as he stands in front of a map with bad-weather symbols. What dirt are the presidential candidates digging up about each other? Some people think election campaigning is a messy business. In one cartoon, Markstein draws attention to negative campaigning and mudslinging between candidates. In politics, mudslinging refers to speaking negatively about another person or opposing party. To make his point, the artist shows two men talking about dirt for sale. One man says to the other, ""The Bush and Kerry campaigns each ordered 2 tons..."" When Gary Markstein was in the fourth grade, he dreamed of being a cartoonist and having his own comic strip. He even put out a humor magazine with a friend that lasted for one issue. Today, Markstein's audience is much larger. He draws cartoons for the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel in Wisconsin. Markstein draws five cartoons a week that focus on politics and sports. To get ideas, he reads several newspapers each morning. ""Coming up with a good idea is the hardest and most challenging part, but it's also the most rewarding,"" he told Weekly Reader. What's the best part of his job? ""I get paid to play!"" said Markstein. ""I draw on a different topic every day. I think it's the best job in the world!"""	4
Each week until Election Day, Grade 4 will look at where the two candidates for president stand on important issues, or problems facing the country. This weekâ€™s issue is jobs and the economy. The economy refers to the making and buying of products. The economy goes through good and bad times. Both candidates want to work on improving the economy because many workers in the United States have lost their jobs over the past few years. The candidates have been discussing another important part of the economy--taxes. American companies and people pay tax money to the government to support public programs. Those programs include building roads and supporting schools and the military. President Bush thinks that lowering taxes will create more jobs. He says that if the government lowers taxes, businesses will have extra money to hire more workers. In addition, he says, lowering taxes will give people more money to spend on products and services. Senator Kerry thinks that creating more jobs is the best way to help businesses grow. He thinks that the government currently gives too many tax breaks to wealthy people and large companies. He wants people who make a lot of money to pay more in taxes than families who donâ€™t make as much.	4
This week Grade 4 looks at where the two major candidates for president stand on homeland security. Both candidates recognize that the world has changed since the devastating terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. Each candidate has his own plan to make the United States more secure and keep its citizens safe. President Bush's antiterrorism program has included removing Saddam Hussein from power in Iraq and restoring freedom to the country. He has also worked to stop terrorist groups in Afghanistan. In October 2001, shortly after the terrorist attacks of September 11, Bush signed the Patriot Act. The law gives the government more power to investigate suspected terrorists. President Bush believes that the law should be renewed when it comes up for review in 2005. Bush also created the Department of Homeland Security in 2002 to keep our airports, borders, and ports safe from attacks. He says that he has worked to improve national security at airports through increased screening and advanced equipment. Senator Kerry promises to continue to track and stop potential terrorists. He voted for both the Patriot Act and the Department of Homeland Security. Kerry supports the Patriot Act's renewal in 2005 if some changes are made to it. He argues that certain sections of the Patriot Act violate citizens' rights. Some of those parts include allowing the government to wiretap phone conversations and search business and library records. If elected, Kerry has a plan to protect the country's borders, ports, and airports. He also says that he will work to give police officers, firefighters, and emergency personnel the information and equipment they need to perform their jobs safely and effectively.	4
"Each week until Election Day, Grade 4 will take a look at where the two candidates for president stand on important issues, or problems facing the country. This week's issue is the war in Iraq. President Bush went to war in Iraq because, he said, the country's dictator, Saddam Hussein, had harmful, illegal weapons. Bush claimed that Iraq and its weapons threatened the United States and other nations. Bush says that the world is safer now that Saddam has been removed from power. His goal is to rebuild Iraq with its own government and establish peace there. Senator Kerry supported a law that allowed the United States to go to war in Iraq. Since then, he has criticized Bush's handling of the war. Kerry said that Bush misled the nation by claiming that Iraq had harmful, illegal weapons. To date, none have been found. Kerry wants to persuade other countries to help rebuild Iraq and ""win the peace."""	4
Each week until Election Day, Grade 4 will look at where the two major candidates for president stand on important issues. This week's issue is education. In 2002, President Bush signed the No Child Left Behind Act. This education law provides states with government money so they can help improve their school systems. The law is meant to ensure that schools are doing enough to help students who are struggling learners. Bush says that the law helps students perform better in reading and math. Under the law, schools are required to measure students' progress through testing. Schools in which many students don't perform well on the tests have two years to improve. Otherwise, students have the option to transfer to different schools. Senator Kerry voted for the No Child Left Behind Act. If elected, he will continue to support this law. However, Kerry wants the government to give states more money to enforce the education law and make sure schools receive the money they need. In addition, Kerry proposes to increase the number of high school graduates. To do that, he plans to reduce class sizes and break up large, failing high schools. He also wants to begin a program in which college students mentor (help) middle school students plan for their futures.	4
Each week until Election Day, Grade 4 will look at where the two major candidates for president stand on important issues. This week's issue is the environment. President Bush says that he has worked to reduce pollution. Earlier this year, he announced a plan to improve the country's water quality. To help Americans breathe cleaner air, Bush started the Clear Skies program. It is designed to reduce the amount of air pollution from power plants. President Bush has allowed companies to cut down trees in some national parks. He says that will help prevent the number of wildfires. The president favors oil drilling in Alaska's Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. He says the new oil source will reduce our dependence on oil from the Middle East and will lower the cost of gasoline. He also wants car companies to use hydrogen fuel cells, a clean energy source, to power vehicles. Senator Kerry does not think President Bush is doing a good job taking care of the environment. He says that Bush has not enforced many important pollution laws. Kerry thinks more needs to be done to keep our waterways clean and free from pollution. He plans to make the air cleaner and launch new ways to protect the country's water supply. If elected, Kerry proposes to give more money to national parks. He says that Bush has let companies cut down too many trees. Kerry also opposes Bush's plan to drill for oil in Alaska. Kerry wants to reduce U.S. dependence on foreign oil by using new forms of energy. He also supports the making of more fuel-efficient vehicles.	4
What is the most famous address in the country? 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue! That is where the White House is located in Washington, D.C., the capital of the United States. The president of the United States lives and works in the White House. President George W. Bush hopes that it remains his home for the next four years. He is the Republican candidate who wants to be reelected president in November. Senator John Kerry, the Democratic candidate, wants to send Bush packing. George Washington never lived in the White House, but he selected the architect, James Hoban, to design it. The house took eight years to build, from 1792 to 1800. John Adams, the second president, was the first to live in the White House. When he and his wife moved into the house on November 1, 1800, many of the rooms were not finished. In 1814, when James Madison was president, British soldiers set fire to the White House. Workers took nearly three years to rebuild the famous house. Since then, many new features and rooms have been added, including the Oval Office. That is where the president works. President Theodore Roosevelt officially named the White House in 1901. His six children were among the many kids who have lived in the White House over the years. What do you think it would be like to live there?	4
How hard will the flu hit this season? U.S. health officials aren't sure, but they fear the number of cases may be higher than usual. There has been a shortage of flu vaccine this year. A flu vaccine is a substance that helps fight the flu. Most people get the vaccine in the form of flu shots. Others get it in the form of nose sprays. This year, only two companies made flu vaccine for the United States. One of the two companies found that its supply, which was being made in England, was damaged. That company was supposed to provide the United States with half of the 100 million doses of flu vaccine expected. The flu is short for influenza (in-floo-EN-zah) and is caused by a virus. A virus is a tiny organism that makes people sick when it invades cells in the body and multiplies. Flu season typically runs from November through March. Fever, a cough, a headache, and muscle aches are among the flu's many signs, or symptoms. There isn't a cure for the flu. Yet health officials say that the flu vaccine can help keep people from catching the bug. Scientists have to create a new flu vaccine each year. That is because the strain, or type, of flu virus changes from year to year. Because of the shortage, the people at highest risk will get the vaccine first. That group includes adults 65 and over, kids 6 to 23 months, and people with serious medical conditions. The vaccine was sent to doctors' offices that care for high-risk patients. Despite the shortage of flu vaccine, doctors say that there are ways to stay healthy. The flu spreads through the air when infected people sneeze or cough. The virus also can spread on the hands of an infected person. Here's how to stop germs from spreading:	4
"Kaleb works on a plantation in the southern United States during the mid-1800s. The young slave faces the toughest decision of his life. For a chance at freedom, he must risk everything and run away from home. That means leaving behind his family and all that is familiar. What would you do if you were in Kaleb's shoes? Using an interactive exhibit, kids who visit the recently opened National Underground Railroad Freedom Center in Cincinnati, Ohio, can help Kaleb make a decision. They can also learn about the consequences of that decision. The new museum opened in August 2004 on the northern bank of the Ohio River. That river once marked the line between slavery and freedom. Historians believe that thousands of slaves who escaped through the Underground Railroad from the South, where slavery was allowed, crossed the Ohio River. The Underground Railroad was not a real railroad. During the late 1700s to mid-1800s, the Underground Railroad was actually a secret system of safe routes that runaway slaves could use as they fled from the South to free Northern states, Canada, and Mexico. The Underground Railroad covered hundreds of hidden routes. Most slaves escaped through Ohio, Indiana, and western Pennsylvania. Slaves made their way to freedom any way they could. Most hid during the day and traveled at night. Along the way, a vast network of black people and white people called abolitionists risked their lives to provide escaped slaves with food, clothing, and shelter. An abolitionist was someone who worked to end slavery. The Underground Railroad got its name because it operated in secrecy. Hiding places for slaves were known as stations. People called station masters provided slaves with food and shelter. Other people, called conductors, guided slaves to freedom. In 1865, the 13th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution abolished, or outlawed, slavery. Interior view of a slave pen. Slaves were locked up in pens before they were sold at auction. Artifacts, paintings, and murals are at the heart of the Freedom Center. Along with films, the exhibits recount the story of slavery in the United States, the dangerous road to freedom, and the continued struggle for liberty around the world today. A slave pen found on a farm in Maysville, Kentucky, serves as the museum's centerpiece. Built in 1830, the wooden pen is about the size of a small house. Slaves were locked up in the pen for months before they were sold at auction to the highest bidder. Another exhibit includes a replica, or reproduction, of a wagon with a fake bottom that was used to hide and transport fleeing slaves on the Underground Railroad. Visitors can also crawl inside a replica of the wooden box that the slave Henry Brown used to ship himself from Virginia to Pennsylvania. ""The Underground Railroad wouldn't have existed if it wasn't for brave people who took a risk to stand up for freedom,"" said DeVillez. ""The museum is a learning center that teaches lessons of courage and the fight for freedom that exists even today."""	4
What qualities do you look for in a friend? Do you look for someone you share common interests with, someone you enjoy spending time with, and someone you trust? If so, it turns out you aren't very different from fish. A new study shows that fish carefully choose their friends and stick together with their pals. Creators of the hit animated movie Finding Nemo must have been onto something. In that film, a clown fish named Marlin recruits his ocean buddies to help rescue his lost son, Nemo. Scientists conducted the study to find out how fish mate and how they protect their habitats. A habitat is a place in nature where a plant or an animal lives. For their research, scientists studied fish called three-spined sticklebacks that live in rivers and streams in England. Scientists also found that to make friends, the sticklebacks rely on senses other than vision. Scientists believe that fish use their sense of smell to find familiar fish.	4
"It's no surprise to Kristielle Pedraza that she finds the same group of people absent from school every day--the boys. Kristielle, 13, attends the first all-girls public school in Dallas. All-girls and all-boys public schools are popping up across the United States. In the past eight years, the number of U.S. public schools offering all-girls and all-boys classes has jumped from eight to 140. Some school officials say kids at all-girls and all-boys schools get better grades because there are fewer discipline problems and there is less peer pressure. Supporters, or advocates, believe girls and boys do better in school when they are taught separately because they learn differently. Leonard Sax founded a group in favor of all-girls and all-boys schools. He says girls perform better in quieter classroom settings and boys do better when asked rapid-fire questions. ""John Kerry, George W. Bush, his father, and Al Gore all went to all-boys schools,"" Sax told The Associated Press. ""We don't think that is a coincidence."" Not everyone agrees that all-girls and all-boys schools are a good idea. Some critics, including many women's groups, believe they violate, or go against, the U.S. Constitution. The 14th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution guarantees all people equal treatment under the law. Critics argue that separating boys and girls in public schools can result in an unfair and unequal environment. Others say it does not prepare students for the working world when they grow up. ""We live in a real world, and that world has got men and women in it,"" women's rights leader Eleanor Smeal told CNN. ""They must compete."""	4
"After the November election, President Bush nominated Condoleezza Rice to become secretary of state. That is the highest job in the president's Cabinet, or group of close advisers. Rice will make history as the first-ever African American woman secretary of state. ""The secretary of state is America's face to the world, and in [Condoleezza Rice] the world will see the strength, grace, and decency of our country,"" Bush told reporters. Being a leader is nothing new to Rice. In 2001, Rice was the first African American woman to become national security adviser. In that position, she worked closely with President Bush and advised him on defense matters. As secretary of state, Rice will advise President Bush on U.S. foreign affairs. She will serve as a top diplomat. A diplomat is a person who represents his or her country abroad. Rice will also work with leaders of other countries on important issues, such as the war in Iraq and the rebuilding of South Asia after the tsunami. Rice has overcome odds to make it to one of the country's top jobs. She was born in Birmingham, Alabama, in 1954, during a time when black people were segregated, or separated, from white people in the South. Rice says her parents taught her that education was the best way to overcome segregation. At 15, she attended college at the University of Denver in Colorado. Bush believes that Rice, a classical pianist and former competitive ice skater, is up to the challenge. ""It is an honor to be asked to serve ... my country once again,"" said Rice. The president's Cabinet is made up of a group of leaders who are in charge of the 15 departments in the executive branch of the government. The president heads up that branch. The Senate must approve President Bush's Cabinet choices. Not everyone agrees with the president's choices for those positions. Cabinet Departments 1. State 2. Treasury 3. Defense 4. Justice 5. Interior 6. Agriculture 7. Commerce 8. Labor 9. Housing and Urban Development 10. Transportation 11. Energy 12. Education 13. Health and Human Services 14. Veterans Affairs 15. Homeland Security"	4
Each week until Election Day, Grade 4 will look at where the two major candidates for president stand on important issues. This week's issue is health care. The costs of health care and prescription drugs in the United States keep rising. Many Americans can't afford health insurance, which covers some medical costs when people are sick. Both candidates want to make sure that all Americans, including children, get affordable, high-quality health care. President Bush says that Americans should be able to choose health care plans that meet their needs at prices they can afford. He also wants health insurance to pay for tests for cancer, diabetes, and other diseases. In December 2003, Bush signed a law to help senior citizens get the expensive medicines they need and choose the doctors they want. Senator Kerry also wants to make sure that all Americans get good health care at prices they can afford. He plans to work to lower the costs of health insurance and prescription drugs, which he says are too high under President Bush. He wants to make sure that the government helps senior citizens and veterans (people who have served in the military) with their health care costs.	4
"Polar bears reign as the kings of the Arctic. Yet there is trouble underfoot for those snow-colored creatures and other wildlife as their icy habitat slips away. The Arctic is the icy, cold region located around the North Pole. In November, scientists from eight countries released a report saying that the Arctic is warming twice as fast as the rest of Earth. In the report, scientists predict that at least half of the summer sea ice in the Arctic will melt by the end of this century. The scientists blame global warming for the Arctic thaw. That is the gradual rise in Earth's temperature. Arctic ice is melting at an alarming rate. Winter temperatures in the Arctic have risen between 4 and 7 degrees Fahrenheit. During the past 30 years, polar bears have lost more than 386,000 square miles of ice--an area larger than the states of Texas and Arizona combined. More than 20,000 polar bears live in the Arctic regions. Disappearing sea ice threatens polar bears and other cold-weather animals. Polar bears use the ice as a bridge to hunt seals, their primary source of food. As the sea ice disappears, the mighty predators, or hunters, catch fewer seals and risk starvation. Seals also depend on the ice to rest and give birth. Scientists fear that polar bears, seals, and other animals that rely on the ice could be wiped out by the end of the century if the warm-up continues. U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service Some of the 4 million people who live in the Arctic have also found themselves on shaky ground. As the frozen land thaws, buildings and roads have weakened. Inuits (IH-nyoo-wets), a group of native people in the region, fish and hunt Arctic animals, including polar bears. They depend on those animals as their main source of food. Inuit hunters are also falling through thinning ice. Rising sea levels have forced some people in the Arctic to move their coastal villages inland. The report warns that melting ice could cause sea levels to continue to rise--up to 3 feet by the end of this century. Towns and cities along coastlines around the world could flood as a result. The warm-up also affects other parts of the planet. Arctic ice and snow reflect heat from the sun into space. Without the ice and snow, the planet would be much warmer. ""The polar regions are essentially the Earth's air conditioner,"" said scientist Michael McCracken. Who cranked up the thermostat on the Arctic? Scientists say human activity is to blame for global warming. People use fossil fuels, such as coal, oil, and natural gas, to power cars, heat homes, and create electricity. Fossil fuels come from the remains of plants and animals that lived millions of years ago. Burning those fuels gives off gases that trap heat from the sun and add to the overheating of the Earth. To protect life in the Arctic, scientists say people need to limit their use of fossil fuels. ""Climate change is not just about the future,"" said scientist Pal Prestud, who worked on the report. ""It is happening now."" The burning of fossil fuels releases carbon dioxide and other gases into the air. Those gases collect in a layer and trap heat from the sun. The layer of gases is like the windows in a greenhouse. The process is called the greenhouse effect. Too much of those gases in the air causes temperatures to rise. That is known as global warming."	4
"1. Stand behind the choking person and wrap your arm around his or her waist. 2. Make a fist and hold it against the person's stomach, about halfway between the belly button and the rib cage. 3. Grab your fist with your other hand. Press it in with an upward thrust. Repeat until the person stops choking. At first, the morning was just like any other. Ten-year-old Emily Hartman from Michigan and her family had gathered to eat breakfast. Her mother was eating cereal in between morning chores. Suddenly, Emily's mom began choking and could not breathe. Some of the cereal had lodged in her throat. That is when Emily quickly jumped into action and performed a lifesaving move called the Heimlich (HIGHM-lik) maneuver. The Heimlich maneuver is a simple emergency technique that can save the life of a person who is choking. Each year, Weekly Reader hears from kids across the country who have successfully performed the Heimlich maneuver. Emily Hartman's mom sent us a letter describing how her then fourth-grade daughter saved her life. When she asked Emily how she had learned the lifesaving move, Emily replied, ""I read it in my Weekly Reader."" Choking had been among the leading causes of death in the United States until the Heimlich maneuver was invented. Henry Heimlich, a doctor from New York, devised the emergency maneuver, which was named after him. Before Dr. Heimlich's discovery, slapping a choking person on the back was the recommended technique. Studies later showed that backslaps could actually cause an object to get stuck even tighter in a person's throat, causing death. Today, the Heimlich maneuver is the recommended emergency method for a choking victim. Since the move was first introduced, it has saved more than 60,000 lives."	4
Hispanic Americans are people whose families have come to the United States from Spanish-speaking countries. Nearly 40 million Hispanic Americans, or Latinos, live in the United States. They are the fastest-growing minority group in the country. Bush and Kerry have run TV ads in Spanish. They are targeting those ads at Hispanic Americans. The candidates are also focused on getting the Hispanic American vote in four states: Florida, Arizona, New Mexico, and Nevada. Why? Political experts say those states have many undecided voters. Those states also hold a large number of the electoral votes that a candidate needs to be elected president. Each state has a different number of electoral votes, based on the stateâ€™s population. The higher a stateâ€™s population, the more electoral votes it has. Electoral votes are cast by the Electoral College. The president is elected by the Electoral College. The Electoral College isnâ€™t a school. It is a group of officials, called electors, who are chosen to represent each state. Each elector pledges to vote for the candidate who gets the most votes in his or her state on Election Day. Experts predict that this will be a close election. They say that the electoral votes of Florida, Arizona, New Mexico, and Nevada could swing the results of the election.	4
"Once upon a time, in a faraway land, a group of tiny people inhabited caves on a remote tropical island in Indonesia. That is a country that lies between Asia and Australia. The little people made stone tools to spear giant rats and hunted large lizards and tiny elephants in packs. Believe it or not, this is no fairy tale. Inside a cave on the Indonesian island of Flores, scientists discovered the bones of seven people who belonged to a new species, or type, of human. The most intact skeleton was that of a child-sized adult female. The miniature humans had bulging eyes and brains that were no bigger than those of newborn babies. Standing barely 3 feet tall, an adult was about the size of a 3-year-old child today. Their tiny size earned them the nickname ""hobbits."" That name comes from the dwarflike creatures that appear in books by The Lord of the Rings author J.R.R. Tolkien. What is even more amazing about the scientists' discovery is that the small humans lived as recently as 13,000 years ago. That may seem very long ago to you, but modern humans existed at the same time. Did the newly discovered hobbits and modern humans live on Flores together? Scientists estimate that modern humans reached the island more than 35,000 years ago. Whether the two groups interacted remains a mystery, but scientists hope the discovery will teach them more about the history of humans."	4
"Francis Campane and his wife took a train trip from Connecticut to Washington, D.C., in the spring. They were headed to the nation's capital to visit the newly opened National World War II Memorial. A memorial is a special monument that honors a person, a group of people, or an event. The World War II memorial opened in April. It was built to honor the 16 million men and women who had served in the armed forces during World War II (1939-1945). The trip was especially meaningful to Campane, 80, because he is a World War II veteran. Veterans are people who have served in the armed forces. Campane served in the U.S. Navy during the war. He was stationed aboard a ship called the U.S.S. Montpelier in the Pacific Ocean. ""I was amazed at the memorial and the gratitude the American people have shown World War II veterans,"" Campane told Weekly Reader. ""It's great to know our generation will be remembered."" A plaza, a reflecting pool, fountains, and stone arches are among the memorial's main features. A wall of gold stars at the memorial honors the more than 400,000 Americans killed in the war. The World War II memorial is one of many places across the country where people will remember the U.S. military on November 11. That is Veterans Day--a holiday set aside to honor our nation's armed forces. People will pay tribute to the 140,000 U.S. troops still serving in Iraq and to the more than 1,000 members of the U.S. military who have died there. For his part, Campane plans to volunteer at a hospital that cares for veterans."	4
"Hiram Bingham lived for adventure. In 1911, the American explorer trekked through the jungles of Peru. He was searching for clues to explain how the once-mighty Inca Empire had disappeared. His journey through the Andes Mountains in South America was not easy. Bingham hacked his way through thick forests and climbed slippery slopes. One wrong stop could have sent him plummeting off a cliff. After crawling up a snake-infested mountain, Bingham stumbled upon one of the greatest finds of the last century. He uncovered ruins from the ""lost city"" of Machu Picchu (MAH-choo PEE-choo). Until Bingham's discovery, the ruins remained hidden for more than 400 years. Machu Picchu, which lies high atop a peak, is an ancient city that belonged to the Incas. Its name means ""old peak."" Thanks to a traveling museum exhibit, people in the United States can go back in time to experience Incan life in Machu Picchu. The exhibit, called ""Machu Picchu: Unveiling the Mysteries of the Incas,"" is currently on display at the Chicago Field Museum. ""It is the first exhibit of its kind,"" museum project manager Hillary Hansen told Weekly Reader. ""It is the largest traveling exhibit of Inca objects."" Many artifacts that Bingham collected are on display--from ceramic jars to copper and bronze jewelry. Artifacts are objects that people made long ago. The Incas were people who ruled one of the largest empires in South America. Their empire extended from present-day Colombia into western Argentina. Their vast civilization began to spread in about 1200. It lasted through the mid-1500s. When Bingham discovered Machu Picchu, he thought he had found the birthplace of the Inca Empire. Since that time, archaeologists have learned that the city served as a summer residence for Incan kings. (Archaeologists study artifacts to learn about the past.) The Incas built Machu Picchu between 1450 and 1470 for the ruler Pachacuti. The royal family would relax, hunt, and entertain foreign visitors there. Machu Picchu wasn't just a home for nobles. About 500 common people lived in the stone city and worked for the royal family as farmers, artisans, and servants. The city was abandoned in the mid-1500s, not long after the Spanish conquistadors (conquerors) arrived. The Inca Empire collapsed under Spanish rule. Today, Machu Picchu is a popular tourist attraction. Nearly 400,000 people visit the ancient grounds each year. Scientists still research the area to unlock more mysteries about the Incas. ""In the scheme of things, we still know very little about Machu Picchu,"" said Hansen. The Incas had no writing, no money system, and no knowledge of the wheel. How do you think they created such a large empire?"	4
"Lily Thorpe is showing kids that they really can make a difference in politics even though they may not be old enough to vote yet. The 11-year-old from Grand Junction, Colorado, recently started an organization called Kids Campaign. ""Kids weren't getting enough of a say in politics,"" Lily told Weekly Reader. ""Grown-ups who vote are making the decision for us. Kids can have a voice."" Kids Campaign is a political action committee. Political action committees bring awareness of various causes to elected officials. In Lily's case, Kids Campaign focuses on bringing children's issues to the attention of politicians. Kids Campaign grew out of a concern that Lily had about her school library. She noticed that many of her school library's books and encyclopedias were outdated. To help schools in Colorado get the education funds and supplies they need, Lily founded Kids Campaign. In the name of kids everywhere, Lily is making her voice heard and is hoping that politicians are listening. She is busy meeting politicians and speaking with them about kids' causes. Lily has some advice for grown-ups. She encourages them to talk to kids about their voting choices. That way, she says, it helps make voting ""a family decision."""	4
On January 17, thousands of people around the country will honor King's work by participating in community service projects and taking part in parades. Martin Luther King Jr. Day became a holiday in 1986. King (1929-1968) was a civil rights leader who worked against discrimination. That is the act of treating others unfairly. King dedicated his life to making sure that African Americans received the same treatment under the law as white people.	4
A group of librarians in Springfield, Illinois, has been booked up. The librarians are busy making sure the world's largest collection of information on President Abraham Lincoln gets to its new home safely. The documents are on their way to the new Abraham Lincoln Presidential Library. The library is located in Springfield--the capital of Illinois. It is scheduled to open this fall. The library will be the new home of the Illinois State Historical Library. Although the new library is only blocks away from the old one, the move hasn't been easy. The six-week move involved several trucks and an army of people to help pack and transport nearly 12 million items. Of those items, about 47,000 books, maps, prints, documents, and other items are related to Lincoln. Abraham Lincoln was president during the Civil War (1861-1865). The U.S. Civil War was fought between the Northern states and Southern states. One of the main issues of the war was that the South wanted the right to own slaves. The North wanted to abolish, or end, slavery. More than 600,000 Americans died in the Civil War--more than any other war in history. The Civil War ended when the South surrendered. Abraham Lincoln (1809-1865) left his mark on Illinois. Although Lincoln was born in a log cabin in Kentucky, he worked as a lawyer in Springfield before he became the 16th president of the United States, in 1861. The library's large collection of research on Lincoln includes many important artifacts. An artifact is a human-made object from the past. Among the artifacts is a handwritten copy of Lincoln's Gettysburg Address. It is one of only five surviving copies. In 1863, Lincoln delivered the famous speech at the battlefield of Gettysburg in Pennsylvania. A museum dedicated to the life of Lincoln is also being built to accompany the library. The museum is scheduled to open in early 2005.	4
How long would it take you to build the world's tallest Lego tower? In just five days, park guests at Legoland in Carlsbad, California, set the Guinness World Record for the tallest Lego tower. The tower stands 92 feet 6 inches tall and is constructed out of a half million bricks. The previous record was set in Estonia, a country in northeastern Europe, in 1998. That tower reached a height of 82 feet.	4
"Harry Potter, you have company. Meet the Baudelaire children--three unlucky orphans who are pursued for their fortune by the villain Count Olaf. The mastermind behind the orphansâ€™ misery is the mysterious author Lemony Snicket (also known as Daniel Handler). His newest dark book, The Grim Grotto, creeps onto bookshelves September 21. The Grim Grotto marks the 11th title in the gloomy and funny A Series of Unfortunate Events books. The latest adventure takes the orphans underwater. They find themselves in dangerous surroundings, aboard a submarine and in a cave filled with poisonous mushrooms. Readers donâ€™t seem to be listening to the authorâ€™s warnings about his dreadful tales. The first 10 books in the series have sold more than 18 million copies. The popularity of the book series has also caught the attention of Hollywood. A movie starring Jim Carrey as the evil Count Olaf will hit theaters this upcoming holiday season. Will the orphansâ€™ luck ever change? ""The fate of the orphans gets better all the time, and then it turns around and gets worse again,"" the author told us. ""The trick is to enjoy the brief moments of good faith that weâ€™re all given before unfortunate events engulf us once more."""	4
"When 13-year-old Katie recently went online, she couldn't believe that some classmates were making fun of her. The seventh grader from New Jersey discovered mean and hurtful comments written about her in an online Web journal. ""It was really offensive and upsetting to me because I knew everyone could see it online,"" Katie told Weekly Reader. ""There was nothing I could do to take it down."" Katie's story is not unusual. She is one of the many victims of cyberbullying. ""Cyberbullying is when a child torments, humiliates, or tries to frighten another child using interactive technology,"" online safety expert Parry Aftab told Weekly Reader. Instead of teasing or picking on kids in the school yard, bullies have new territory—cyberspace. The explosion in technology, such as computers, cell phones, and interactive games, gives bullies more places to do their dirty work. Cyberbullies use e-mail, instant messages, text messages, and online journals to spread nasty rumors, post embarrassing photos, and tease other kids. Breaking into others' e-mail accounts and sending out mean messages to their buddy lists is a common practice for cyberbullies. Cyberbullies also run up other kids' cell phone bills with text messages. Some kids have even conducted online votes for the ugliest person in class. For many kids like Katie, online bullying has become part of everyday life. Most cyberbullies are between the ages of 9 and 14. Studies show that about 55 percent of kids in grades 4 through 8 have had mean or hurtful remarks made to them online. ""Cyberbullying is a huge problem in fourth, fifth, and sixth grades,"" said Aftab. Why is cyberbullying such a growing problem? For starters, kids spend a lot of time online at both home and at school. Nearly two-thirds of American kids have computers in their homes, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. Online experts say being mean online is easier because computers give kids a sense of being anonymous, or not being known. Kids say things on the Internet that they would never say face-to-face. Some kids also don't realize that they're cyberbullies because they don't see the consequences of their actions. ""In face-to-face communication, we see when we've gone too far,"" she says. ""We lose all those visual cues online."" To address the problem, more schools and communities are educating kids about online etiquette and are holding anti-bullying seminars. Aftab trains groups, called TweenAngels and TeenAngels, to become safe and responsible cybercitizens who share their knowledge with others. TeenAngel Kendall, 12, experienced cyberbullying when kids at school blocked him out of gaming sites. His advice for dealing with a cyberbully: ""Don't be afraid to tell your parents, teachers, or whomever you trust the most."" Another recommended way to combat, or fight, cyberbullying, is to take a stand against it. ""The only way cyberbullying will stop is if kids protect each other,"" says Aftab. ""If you stand by and let someone else hurt someone, you're part of the problem. You need to be part of the solution."""	4
"Entire communities used to shut down each summer between 1930 and the early 1950s as families kept their kids indoors. Parents feared their children would be exposed to a disease called polio. The disease crippled many people and sometimes caused death. Thanks to Jonas Salk, polio has been almost wiped out worldwide. Salk was a doctor who invented a vaccine to prevent the disease. Vaccines are shots or medications that protect people from getting certain diseases. Salk's vaccine was officially declared safe on April 12, 1955. In honor of the 50th anniversary of that event, a new exhibit will open on April 12 at the Smithsonian's National Museum of American History in Washington, D.C. The exhibit is called ""Whatever Happened to Polio?"" Polio is a highly contagious disease. That means it can be passed easily from person to person. Polio can strike at any age but mainly affects kids. The disease spreads when a virus attacks the nerve cells in the spinal cord and brain that control muscles in the arms, legs, and stomach. It can paralyze people, causing them to lose movement in different parts of their body. The museum's exhibit will look at the history of polio and the development of the vaccine. Included among the objects to be displayed are the leg braces worn by President Franklin D. Roosevelt, who suffered from the disease. Although polio has disappeared from much of the world, it still threatens children in Africa and Southeast Asia. The new exhibit will focus on current efforts to immunize, or give vaccines to, children in those places. One of the most famous victims of polio was Franklin D. Roosevelt, the 32nd president of the United States. In 1921, Roosevelt contracted polio and was confined to a wheelchair, although he was able to stand and take a few steps while wearing leg braces. The president declared a war on the disease. Exactly 10 years after his death, Salk's vaccine was announced officially safe."	4
"*Fiber optics are thin glass or plastic tubes through which light passes. They are used in medical operations and in cable, telephone, and other communication systems. If you are like many kids, you surf the Internet, write e-mails, and use instant messaging to contact your friends. You probably listen to your favorite songs on a portable CD player. You might even take pictures and send them to others—with a cell phone! Would you believe that 25 years ago computers, CDs, and cell phones as you know them didn't exist? In fact, much of the technology you use today was very different then. A group of technology leaders was organized by the Lemelson-MIT Program. Those leaders recently made a list of the top 25 innovations from the last 25 years. An innovation is a new invention or a new way of improving something. The items on the list have improved since 1980, according to the group. Each of the chosen items has had ""a direct impact on our everyday lives and could dramatically affect our lives in the future."" Can you guess which innovation was crowned ""tech king""? The Internet, of course! The Internet took the top spot because it has provided people with access to a world of information. Coming in second was the cell phone. In 1980, a cell phone was so large that it barely fit in a purse. Before 1980, some computers, which took third place, filled an entire room! How much has technology changed in the past 25 years? Take a look at a few of the improvements that have been made. Cell phones weighed about 2 pounds and were almost a foot long. Very few people had one. TVs had screens with minimal details; some were still black and white! Most kids tuned TVs to The Dukes of Hazzard—the number-two show in 1980. High-definition televisions (HDTVs) produce high-quality, lifelike images. Many Americans have their TVs tuned to reality shows, such as American Idol. 35mm cameras used film to take pictures. The film had to be developed to see the images—a process that usually took hours."	4
"George Custer Armstrong, a famous general, had his last stand at the Battle of the Little Bighorn in Montana in 1876. Custer and his troops tried to force Native Americans off their land. The Sioux Indian chief Crazy Horse led Native Americans in a fierce fight against Custer to defend their land. During the battle, Crazy Horse and his people conquered, or defeated, Custer and his troops. Crazy Horse was considered a hero to his tribe. Today, he is honored with a giant monument that is being carved out of a mountain in the Black Hills of South Dakota, where he was born. This year marks the 65th anniversary of the decision to construct the famous granite monument. It will depict the Sioux chief Crazy Horse atop a horse. The white sculpture (front) is how the monument will look when it is finished. The brown sculpture (back) is how the monument looks today. In 1939, a Sioux Indian leader invited a sculptor to carve the famous memorial in South Dakota. What started out as a one-man project has turned into a family affair. The sculptor blasted into the mountain for the first time in 1948. The sculptor died in 1982. His wife, children, and family continue his work today. Once completed, the Crazy Horse Memorial will be the world's largest sculpture. The memorial is expected to be 641 feet long and 563 feet high. That is nine times as high as the four presidents' faces at nearby Mount Rushmore. When will the project be complete? ""There's no way to tell when it will be finished,"" said the sculptor's wife. ""The dream is there. We just keep working."""	4
Scientists are piecing together clues to solve a puzzle about Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. They're trying to determine whether a skull kept at a private location in Salzburg, Austria, belongs to the famous music composer. Austria is a country in Europe. Mozart was born in Salzburg in 1756 and was buried in Vienna, Austria, in 1791. According to legend, sometime later a gravedigger took the skull, which eventually ended up in Salzburg. Now scientists have opened a grave in Salzburg that they believe holds the remains of Mozart's father and other relatives. Researchers plan to conduct DNA tests on those remains. DNA from humans contains information that scientists can use to determine whether people are related to each other. The skull could belong to Mozart if it matches the DNA of his father or other relatives. Austria has officially declared 2006 the year of celebrations for Mozart. That country will commemorate, or honor, the 250th anniversary of the composer's birth.	4
"Mystery has surrounded King Tutankhamen's death for more than 80 years. Since his tomb was excavated, or dug up, in 1922, scientists have been left wondering: Was the ancient Egyptian king murdered? Scientists recently performed a computerized X-ray called a CAT scan on King Tut's 3,300-year-old mummy. The results of the tests indicated that Tut wasn't violently murdered but might have suffered a badly broken leg shortly before his death. The injury could have led to a dangerous infection. After ascending, or rising to, the throne when he was nearly 8 years old, Tut died mysteriously at age 19. The recent tests confirmed his exact age at the time of his death. In 1968, X-rays performed on Tut's mummy showed that he might have suffered a blow to the head—a sign that he could have been violently murdered. Now scientists say that is not the case. ""In answer to theories that [Tut] was murdered, the team found no evidence for a blow to the back of the head, and no other indication of foul play,"" an Egyptian spokesperson reported. Despite the finding, some experts say the tests haven't solved the mystery—and haven't ruled out murder. One idea is that Tut was poisoned. Nearly 10,000 Weekly Reader students put on their detective caps to solve King Tut's murder. Check out the results to see who you thought might have committed the crime."	4
"The bald eagle is one of many important symbols that represent freedom in the United States. Can you guess some other famous ones? Read the clues to help you identify our mystery photos. Say hello to America's leading lady! This statue was a gift to the United States from France. It is located in New York Harbor and has become a symbol of hope and freedom to people who have moved to the United States from other countries. What do George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, Abraham Lincoln, and Theodore Roosevelt have in common? Their faces are chiseled into this mountainside. Located in South Dakota, the monument is one of the largest stone carvings in the world. Let freedom ring is this symbol's motto! In 1752, it was built in England and moved to Philadelphia. This famous symbol cracked soon after it arrived. It is made mostly of copper and weighs more than 2,000 pounds. Washington, D.C., is home to many historic buildings, but you can spot this famous one because of its domed roof. Built on a hill, it is home to the U.S. Congress--the branch of government that makes laws. This famous symbol has quite a few stars, but they're not the Hollywood kind. Some people call it ""Old Glory"". It has gone through a lot of changes since 1777, although it still has its original 13 stripes, which stand for the 13 original Colonies. The United States can thank this symbol for its independence. It declared that the 13 Colonies were free from England's rule. Thomas Jefferson drafted most of it. Today, it is protected in a special glass case in Washington, D.C."	4
"Plans for an African-American history museum in Washington, D.C., have been in the works for more than a year. Recently, several African-American leaders were appointed to help manage the project. They include talk-show host Oprah Winfrey and Robert Johnson, the founder of Black Entertainment Television (BET). The museum will be part of the Smithsonian Institution. Although its exact location has not yet been determined, officials hope that it may find a home on the National Mall. The U.S. government is paying for about half the museum's $400 million cost. The museum's leaders will help raise the rest of the money. The museum will celebrate the contributions of African Americans in the United States. It will highlight African-American history and culture from the Civil War (1860-1865) to the present. ""I look forward to the day the National Museum [of African-American history] opens and I can take my children and grandchildren to not only see history but be part of it,"" said one of the committee members. The museum is expected to open in 2013."	4
"Nine-year-old Hannah Niles loves poetry! The fourth grader especially enjoys reading poetry by Edgar Allan Poe. ""He uses a lot of expression and detail in his poems,"" she told Weekly Reader. Hannah belongs to the Basketball Poets. That is a group of 40 fourth and fifth graders at Supply Elementary School in Supply, North Carolina. The students meet once a week in the gym, where they read, write, memorize, and perform poetry. Then they play basketball. Poetry lets kids express themselves. ""If you're nervous, you write a poem about being nervous. If you're happy, you write a poem about being happy,"" said 10-year-old Douglas Mitchell. The Basketball Poets also had the opportunity to meet two published poets—Kenn Nesbitt and Sharon Creech. Both children's authors visited the school and gave the students advice on writing poetry. ""They were professional, and we're kids, so that's exciting,"" said Hannah. Who came up with the idea for the Basketball Poets? It was the school's physical education teacher, Marty Mentzer. She sees the club as a way for kids to keep their minds and bodies fit. ""It's cool to be a reader and a writer,"" she said, ""and basketball teaches them teamwork."""	4
"Fourth grader Christina Moore from Belmont, Massachusetts, has a busy schedule. Along with doing her homework, she plays ice hockey and takes flute lessons. Once bedtime rolls around, she is usually exhausted. Like most kids her age, Christina has some strange—and silly—dreams. ""In one dream, the Sesame Street characters ate leftover casserole in my kitchen and wouldn't give any to me,"" Christina told Weekly Reader. ""In another dream, a group of parents were so unhappy with their kids' grades that they pushed them off a building into a salad filled with French dressing!"" Whenever she gets sick, Christina has the same dream—someone is chasing her through a forest. What do those dreams mean? No one quite knows for sure, but scientists are getting closer to solving the puzzle. They are using new technology to study how the sleeping brain works. Although there are still many mysteries about sleep, scientists know that everyone needs sleep to boost brain power and keep the body healthy. School-age kids need at least nine hours of sleep each night to perform their best in school. So can a good night's sleep help Christina do her best playing ice hockey and the flute? Can sleep help you? You bet! ""Getting a good night's sleep is good for your brain and body and helps you grow,"" sleep expert David Dinges told Weekly Reader. ""You're less likely to be tired the next day, you're less grouchy, more alert, and perform better in school and in sports."" One of those stages is rapid eye movement, or REM, sleep. It gets that name because your eyes move around quickly under closed eyelids. Your brain becomes very active during REM sleep. Most dreaming takes place during that sleep stage. Your body cycles through REM and non-REM stages several times a night. Each cycle lasts about 90 minutes. Everybody dreams—although scientists don't know exactly why. Scientists have different theories, or ideas, about why dreams are useful. One theory is that dreams help make sense of the day's events. Some scientists think that dreams help the brain sort and store information. The latest evidence shows that dreams may help people master new physical skills, such as playing an instrument or riding a bike. Both dreaming and getting a good night's sleep may also help people improve their problem-solving skills. In one study, scientists divided volunteers into groups to solve a math problem. The group that received more sleep solved the problem more often than the group that didn't receive as much sleep. Why do we remember some dreams but not others? When you wake up affects how vividly you recall your dreams. If you awaken during REM sleep, you're more likely to remember the details of a dream. If you wake up during another stage, you might not remember your dreams as well—or at all. Whether or not you remember your dreams, it's important to get into a healthful sleep routine. ""The enemies of sleep are staying up late to play video games or watch TV,"" said Dinges. Like people, all warm-blooded animals dream. Some animals sleep a little, and others sleep a lot. The amount of sleep an animal requires depends on its needs. Take a look at the sleep patterns of some creatures. Koalas like their sleep. They live in eucalyptus trees in Australia. Koalas dine on a steady diet of eucalyptus leaves, which are not very nutritious. To store up their energy, koalas snooze up to 18 hours a day. Giraffes don't need pillows because they sleep only 2 hours a day—mostly standing up. They only lie down to dream. A giraffe doesn't lie down that much because it would take too long to get up if a predator were to approach. Bottle-nosed dolphins sleep and swim at the same time! They need to keep breathing while they rest, so they let one-half of their brain sleep and keep one eye open. Dolphins rest for 7 hours a day on and off, switching sides of the brain they shut down."	4
"Lily Davidson doesn't just feel the beat. Now she can hear it. The 8-year-old girl, who was born deaf, no longer lives in silence. Thanks to a special hearing device called a cochlear implant, or bionic ear, Lily can now hear. Since receiving her bionic ear four years ago, Lily has soared to the top of her class in reading and writing. For the past two years, she has taken violin lessons, and she hopes to land a spot in her school orchestra. Lily lives with her family in Scotland, a country in Europe. Lily's future looks bright now, but that wasn't always the case. When Lily was born, she was very sick. Doctors treated her with medicine that saved her life but left her completely deaf. Her brother Max, now 10, and her family learned sign language to communicate with Lily. After undergoing surgery for the implant, Lily learned to speak. How does the bionic ear work? People hear when sound waves travel to a bone, called the cochlea, in the ear. The cochlea changes sound to electrical signals that are sent to the brain. The bionic ear does a similar job. It helps sound bypass, or skip over, the cochlea. Lily has to switch on the bionic ear for it to work. Lily's accomplishments have inspired many people, especially her mom. ""She is just amazing and has taught us to aim high,"" she told a Scottish newspaper. 1. Sound enters through the outer ear. 2. Sound travels through the ear canal. 3. Sound hits the eardrum, causing it to vibrate. 4. Small bones called the hammer, anvil, and stirrup also vibrate. 5. The vibrations are passed to the cochlea (KO-klee-ah). This snail-shaped tube changes sound into electrical signals. 6. The hearing nerve sends the sound messages to the brain. The brain figures out what was heard."	4
"A gold-speckled and red-striped goby fish stands guard while a snapping shrimp digs a burrow. Both use the burrow for protection. The fish and the shrimp live off Guam, an island in the Pacific Ocean. The goby fish is among 106 new species, or types, of fish that scientists counted in the world's oceans in 2004 as part of a 10-year study. That means more than two new species of fish were discovered each week last year! About 1,000 scientists from 70 countries are participating in the ocean count. They will finish their study in 2010. Water covers about two-thirds of Earth's surface. The five main oceans are the Atlantic, the Pacific, the Indian, the Arctic, and the Southern. So far, scientists have discovered nearly 15,500 species of fish in the world's oceans. They are among 230,000 known plants and animals living beneath the ocean's surface. Scientists believe that they may find up to 2 million life-forms by the time they complete their count. ""We have barely skimmed the surface,"" said one scientist. Why are scientists conducting the study? They want to learn more about the oceans, which are among the least-known parts of Earth's surface. Scientists say species found below 1,200 feet are 50 times more likely to be new. One scientist involved in the study said that less is known about the ocean than is known about ""the far side of the moon."" Scientists plan to use the results of the study to prevent people from overfishing. They also want to use the information to protect ocean life."	4
"Four cheetah cubs frolicked in the snow, flipped backward down a hill, and played follow the leader at the National Zoo in Washington, D.C. The two males and two females made their debut, or first public appearance, at the zoo in early February. The cheetah cubs, then just 10 weeks old, explored the outdoors under the watchful eye of their mother, Tumai. It was a big event for the zoo! The fuzzy, caramel-colored cats were the first cheetahs born at the zoo in its 115-year history. Zoo workers have been caring for the animals, which were born in late November. At the time of their first public appearance, the spotted cubs were about the size of house cats, weighing 10 pounds each. They will grow to their full adult weight of 100 pounds within about a year. The cheetahs' outdoor playtime has been limited to several hours a day because of chilly temperatures. ""They actually seem to like the snow,"" said the zoo's cheetah keeper, Craig Saffoe. Cheetahs are the world's fastest land animals. In the wild, the fast cats live mainly in Africa, but they are heading toward extinction as they lose their natural habitat. The National Zoo is working with groups in Africa to help protect cheetahs. In the meantime, the zoo is proud of its newest cheetah cubs, whose individual personalities have started to shine. ""One girl is very mischievous, while the other is very [pushy],"" Saffoe told reporters. ""One of the males loves to climb trees, and his brother is very relaxed."""	4
Talk about a bird's-eye view of an ostrich farm! Weekly Reader visited the Westcoast Ostrich Show Ranch near Cape Town, South Africa. South Africa is a country in Africa. Ostriches are the world's biggest birds. They have plump, round bodies covered with feathers, and long, skinny necks covered with soft fluff. Male ostriches weigh up to 350 pounds and can grow up to 8 feet tall. That's a foot taller than basketball player Shaquille O'Neal! At the farm in South Africa, the ostriches roam an area of flat land almost the size of 200 football fields. The workers at the farm take care of the ostrich eggs--the biggest of all bird eggs. At almost 3 pounds, each egg is about the size of a football. Even though an ostrich egg looks fragile, it is very strong. You could put a 300-pound weight on the egg without cracking its shell. Believe it or not, even a baby elephant could sit on an ostrich egg!	4
"U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service Do Florida panthers have nine lives? Scientists sure hope so! The wild cats are on the brink of extinction, or dying out. During the early 1900s, hundreds of the large, light-brown cats roamed the southeastern United States. Today, panthers can be found only in southern Florida. Wildlife officials estimate that only between 80 and 100 panthers are left in the Sunshine State. What is causing the sharp decline in the panther population? Hunting and habitat loss are mainly to blame. During the mid- to late 1900s, millions of people flocked to Florida for its warm climate and inexpensive land. As people built homes and roads, panthers were squeezed out of their habitat. In 1967, Florida panthers were placed on the endangered species list in the United States. The list was created to protect animals that are on the edge of extinction. Today, wildlife officials are working to keep the wild cats out of peril, or danger. Workers have installed fencing along 40 miles of public roads in south-western Florida to prevent panthers from colliding with cars and other vehicles. Officials are also making efforts to save the land where panthers live from further development. ""We have to protect what's left of their habitat,"" panther expert Bob DeGross told Weekly Reader."	4
President George W. Bush and Senator John Kerry have been racing along the campaign trail for months now. With Election Day around the corner, they have their eyes on the finish line. Take a look at the path they are taking to get elected. January to June: Bring it on! Candidates within the same political party face off against one another in primaries and caucuses. Those are special state elections in which people vote for the person they want as their party's candidate for president. John Kerry defeated eight other candidates who were competing for the Democratic Party's nomination. George W. Bush did not have to compete in the primary elections, because he did not face any challengers for the Republican nomination. July to September: Party on! After the primaries, each political party holds a nominating convention. The conventions may seem like large parties, but they are important events. That is where each political party officially chooses its candidate for president. John Kerry accepted his party's nomination to run for president at the Democratic National Convention. It was held in Boston from July 26 to 29. President George W. Bush accepted the nomination to run for a second term in office at the Republican National Convention. It took place in New York City from August 30 to September 2. September to October: It's time to face off! Since the party conventions, George W. Bush and John Kerry have been giving speeches to encourage people to vote for them. They are also participating in debates. A debate is a formal argument between candidates about where they stand on various issues. November 2: Every vote counts! Millions of Americans will head to the polls to vote for president. The presidential election is held every four years on the first Tuesday after the first Monday in November.	4
"Nine-year-old Luke from Florida has some advice for the next president of the United States. ""Please make world peace and stop world hunger,"" he says. Luke is one of hundreds of kids around the country who have written letters to George W. Bush and John Kerry. The kids are sharing their ideas and sending special messages to the presidential candidates as part of a letter-writing program. The Mary Baker Eddy Library in Boston started the letter-writing program called Words for the Next President. The goal of the program is to inspire children to voice their opinions and take part in the upcoming election. Some of the letters will be sent to both presidential candidates. Many kids wrote about the war in Iraq, education, and the environment. One 10-year-old from Georgia said, ""Be sure before you act, help the homeless, help the poor, and do your best."""	4
"The Quabbin Lake Singers are in tune with their culture. The group sings at powwows, or gatherings, to celebrate their Native American traditions. Weekly Reader was invited to a powwow in Connecticut where the singers recently performed. In the past, powwows were religious ceremonies for Native Americans. Today, they are joyful, festive events that honor Native American life. The Quabbin Lake Singers are all members of the Mann family. They are part of the Historical Nipmuc tribe in Massachusetts. Nipmuc means ""freshwater people."" The family includes three brothers: Sahyeed, 9; Nantai, 8; and Anoki, 7. Along with their parents, the boys sing at powwows in the Native American language of Nipmuc. During the summer and on school vacations, the family travels around the United States and Canada. They combine old customs with new ones. The family performs ancient Native American songs and writes their own music. ""Not only are we having fun,"" their dad told Weekly Reader, ""but we're keeping our culture alive."""	4
"Twelve-year-old Alice Abassah from Africa cares about the environment. She recently started a clean-up program in her home country of Ghana. ""I was inspired by my teacher to go around once a week and collect litter,"" Alice told Weekly Reader. ""When my friends and neighbors saw me, they joined me."" Alice is one of 450 kids from 50 countries around the world who recently gathered to help care for the planet. The kids attended the 2004 International Children's Conference on the Environment. The conference was held in New London, Connecticut, this summer. Weekly Reader joined the festivities to learn how the kid delegates are helping the environment. A delegate is someone who represents his or her country. Parade of Flags. Some children dressed in costumes to represent their countries and walked with their national flags. During their weeklong conference, the kid delegates participated in workshops, discussions, and field trips. Some kids traded pins representing their nations. They also displayed their countries' flags during a special ceremony. The environmental conference resembled a miniature version of the United Nations. The United Nations is an organization made up of countries around the world. Members of the United Nations work toward achieving world peace and solving global problems, such as environmental concerns. The United Nations helped to arrange the conference. At the conference, kids challenged world leaders to help them protect the environment. They asked leaders to enforce laws that support the environment and conserve, or save, natural resources, such as trees and water. In their own schools and communities, the delegates all participate in environmental projects. Many of the children shared their projects and ideas at the conference. The conference also provided kids with the opportunity to learn about different cultures and to make international friends. A person's culture is his or her way of life, ideas, and traditions. Eleven-year-old Federico Gonzalez from Colombia enjoyed learning about new cultures. Colombia is a country located in South America. ""You get to know people who speak different languages,"" he said. Amanda Loewy, 11, from Massachusetts, had a blast! ""I met kids from Japan, Taiwan, Uganda, Canada, Australia, and many other places,"" she told Weekly Reader. ""I heard about the environmental issues that kids are facing all over the world. We talked about what we are doing to help the environment. I also made lots of good friends."""	4
A team of scientists in northern India discovered a new species of monkey in December. The large brown-haired monkey has a short tail and is a member of the macaque (mah-KAK) family. The find surprised scientists because discoveries of new animals of this size are rare. Although the species was new to scientists, people living in the area are quite familiar with these monkeys. The locals call them mun zala, or deep-forest monkeys.	4
"A team of scientists might be ditching the phrase ""oh, rats!"" from their vocabulary. They are experimenting with ways that rats may help find people who are buried as a result of earthquakes or other disasters. Like dogs, rats have a strong sense of smell, which helps them sniff out survivors. The rodents are also small enough to crawl almost anywhere. Dogs can be limited in their searches because of their larger size. The scientists trained the rats to recognize the scent of people. To do that, researchers implanted electronic devices into the brains of the animals. The electronic devices affect the rat's brain so that it picks up the scent of a person and then plans how to locate the person. Signals from the rat's brain are relayed to a radio transmitter that scientists attach to the rodent's back. Rescue teams then will be able to track those signals and follow the rat's path. That will help rescuers determine where to start digging for survivors. Scientists hope to have the rat rescuers on the job within the next nine months."	4
"As a little girl, Eileen Collins dreamed of becoming an astronaut when she grew up. ""I wanted to fly the space shuttle,"" she said. ""When I was very young and first started reading about astronauts, there were no women astronauts."" After many years of hard work in college, flight school, and the military, Collins's dream came true. She made history in 1995 as the first woman to pilot a space shuttle. In 1999, she made history again when she became the first female shuttle commander for NASA, the U.S. space agency. A commander is someone who leads a crew. Collins may enjoy the distinction of being the first female shuttle commander, but she hopes it's ""not for long!"" A distinction is an accomplishment that sets a person apart from others. Collins wants more women to follow in her footsteps. ""The young people are going to be the ones to take us on to more exciting adventures,"" she said. NASA's space shuttles have been confined to Earth since February 1, 2003. On that tragic day, the space shuttle Columbia exploded after a 16-day mission. All seven astronauts aboard were killed. During liftoff, a piece had broken off Columbia's fuel tank and smashed a hole in the wing's heat-resistant tiles. Those tiles protect the shuttle from the very high temperatures that the craft experiences when speeding back into Earth's atmosphere. The damage went undetected, and Columbia unexpectedly exploded. After the accident, space travel seemed riskier than ever. Because of the dangers, some people wondered whether NASA's shuttles would return to space. Now NASA officials say it's time. Collins will lead the historic return-to-flight mission. The mission is scheduled for May or June on the space shuttle Discovery. Although NASA's shuttles have been grounded, they haven't been collecting dust. In fact, Collins and her crew of six astronauts have been very involved in updates to the shuttles to prevent another disaster. (See ""A Safer Shuttle."") Collins and NASA officials are confident that the shuttle is safer than ever, and the crew is ready for the upcoming mission. ""It's time for us to go fly,"" said Collins. ""If [the shuttle] wasn't safe, I wouldn't get on it."" The crew of Discovery will be busy on the mission. The shuttle will deliver supplies and equipment to the International Space Station. That is a research laboratory being built in space. Collins also plans to guide Discovery through a slow somersault called a flip. This will be the first time this maneuver, or move, will be done. The flip will help the crew check for any damage to the heat-resistant tiles. The mission's success will be measured on how the safety improvements made to Discovery work. Collins views a successful, safe mission as a chance to prove to the world that NASA has reduced the risk of space travel. To Collins and the crew, there is more than success at stake. They believe the mission will honor the lost astronauts of Columbia. ""It's their legacy we're continuing,"" said a crew member. NASA has been working to make the shuttle safer. New inspection tools and cameras have been installed on Discovery. Changes have been made in the fuel tank design to make sure that no parts fall off during the launch. Once in space, the astronauts will control a robotic arm called a boom from inside the shuttle. A camera at the end of the boom will look for damage on the shuttle's underside and wings. If damage is detected, the astronauts can attempt to repair it or wait to be rescued at the International Space Station. Given the dangers of space travel, should the shuttle program continue? Why or why not?"	4
"New York City's mayor, Michael Bloomberg, is a billionaire who could take a limousine to work. Instead, he rides the subway to his office at City Hall each morning. ""A hundred years ago, a generation of New Yorkers had the courage and conviction to build a subway system that transformed our city,"" said Mayor Bloomberg. ""Today our subway is the backbone of New York."" On October 27, 2004, New York City marked the centennial, or hundredth anniversary, of its subway system with special ceremonies. As part of the celebration, people took tours to retrace the original 9.1-mile route from City Hall to Harlem. Construction began on the subway in 1900 and took 12,000 workers four years to complete. At that time, the population of New York City was 3.4 million and growing. People, horse-drawn carriages, trolleys, and vendors packed city streets. City officials believed that a subway system would help people get around faster and allow them to move into outer areas. What started out as one subway line with 28 stations has grown into 26 lines with 468 stations. A fare in 1904 cost only a nickel. Today, about 4.5 million people ride the subway daily and pay $2 a ride. The subway has seen plenty of change since 1904. Over the years, workers have restored many old subway stations. They have found mosaics and murals hidden under dirt. Public artwork now graces 140 subway stations as part of the Art for Transit program. ""You can probably say that the New York subway system is one of the largest art museums in the world,"" Roxanne Robertson of the New York Transit Museum told Weekly Reader."	4
"A new fashion trend has hit some public schools across the country. More schools are requiring students to wear uniforms or are enforcing stricter dress codes. Students at Lakeside Elementary School in Cincinnati, Ohio, said good-bye to jeans, T-shirts, and oversized, baggy clothes this school year. Instead, they must wear tan, navy, or black pants and shirts with a collar. Girls are also allowed to wear jumpers or skirts. The students in Ohio are not alone. From California to New York, an estimated 11 million public schools mandate, or require, dress codes for students. Some people support the idea of dress codes. School officials say that dress codes often improve discipline and lessen teasing and bullying. Students focus on schoolwork instead of fashion. ""I like uniforms,"" Brittany, a student at Lakeside, told Weekly Reader. ""No one judges you, because you are wearing the same thing that they are."" Some parents say that another benefit of wearing uniforms is that it saves money. They think uniforms are less expensive than designer clothes. Not all people are in favor of dress codes. Some parents say that dress codes violate, or go against, kids' freedom of expression. That right is guaranteed in the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. Others argue that dress codes take away their kids' creativity by preventing them from choosing what to wear. Maggie, a student at Lakeside, told Weekly Reader that she doesn't like to wear a uniform, because ""all the outfits are the same."" Some parents don't agree that buying uniforms is less expensive. They say it can be costly to purchase clothes to meet dress codes."	4
"Move over, C-3PO and R2-D2. There is a new droid in town. A team of scientists have developed a new robot that learns to walk like a young child. The robot, called Toddler, improves its step and balance with each stride. Toddler, along with two other robots, was unveiled in February at the meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science. All three robots have a humanlike gait, or way of walking. Toddler, the most advanced robot of the group, can learn to walk in about 20 minutes, or 600 steps. While these aren't the first robots to strut their stuff, scientists say they're different from other versions of walking robots. Previous versions of walking robots needed a motor to power every movement in their legs, knees, and ankles. They required large amounts of energy to move—about 10 times as much as the three new robot models. Each of the new robots falls and catches itself as it moves forward. This is essentially the same way a person learns to walk. The walking robots also swing their arms forward at every step to help with balance, just like a person does. Why are scientists developing robots with the ability to walk like humans? Scientists say that the new robots are more than high-tech toys. They hope that walking robots may one day be able to perform tasks that are difficult or hazardous for humans, including dangerous space missions. Imagine you have to design a robot. What does it look like? How does it help people? Scientists also believe that this type of technology will lead to medical breakthroughs in the future. The latest technology may be used to help create new types of robotic limbs for people who have lost their arms or legs. ""This is the foundation for what we may see in [robotics] in the future,"" said scientist Michael Foster, who oversaw the development of the new walking robots."	4
"It's no surprise that Wangari Maathai (wahn-GAHR-ee mah-TIE) planted a tree in her hometown in Kenya after learning that she won the Nobel Peace Prize. Kenya is a country located in East Africa. Thanks to Maathai, many trees have taken root in Africa. Maathai was honored with the Nobel Peace Prize for saving forests and working for women's rights in Africa. She is the first African woman to win the prize. ""It's a really great surprise,"" Maathai said when she heard the good news. The Nobel Peace Prize is one of the world's most prestigious, or important, awards. Maathai will accept the Nobel Peace Prize in Oslo, Norway, on December 10. The prize is presented each year on this date in honor of its founder's death. The Nobel Prizes have been awarded each year since 1901. Their founder, Alfred Nobel (1833-1896), was a Swedish scientist who invented dynamite. Winners are honored with a $1.3 million award and a gold medal. Judges award the Nobel Peace Prize to a person or a group working for peace. Nobel Prizes are also given for achievements in science, medicine, and literature. Those prizes are presented on December 10 as well, but in Stockholm, Sweden. Maathai has dedicated her life to helping the environment. In 1977, she founded the Green Belt Movement. This organization has helped plant more than 30 million trees across Africa, which has suffered from the loss of forests. The judges awarded Maathai the prize for growing more than trees. They said she has planted the seeds of peace by making sure that people have natural resources so they don't fight over them. This year's Nobel Peace Prize recipient joins a group of well-known winners. Have you heard of any of them?"	4
"Talk about a long trip! The Cassini spacecraft has spent nearly seven years on a journey into the far reaches of space. During that time, it has covered more than 2 billion miles. In July, the spacecraft finally reached its destination--the ringed planet of Saturn. ""The trip has sort of been like a long car drive, and we canâ€™t wait to get out there and explore the sites,"" said NASA scientist Jeremy Jones about the mission. ""In a sense, the tour is just beginning."" Over the next four years, that tour will include studying Saturn, its rings, and its 33 known moons. Scientists say that Saturn holds clues to how the solar system formed. They think that Saturn and its moons are like a miniature version of our solar system. After darting through a gap in Saturnâ€™s shimmering rings, Cassini is currently orbiting, or flying a course around, the planet. Cassini, which is named after an early astronomer, weighs about 6 tons with fuel and is more than 22 feet long. That is about the size of a small school bus. Cassini is the most advanced spacecraft ever launched in history. The unmanned spacecraft is packed with equipment to collect information about Saturn. It holds two cameras, which are sending photos back to Earth. Saturn, the sixth planet from the sun, lies between Jupiter and Uranus. Of the nine planets in the solar system, Saturn is the second largest, after Jupiter. In fact, more than nine Earths would fit across Saturn. The planetâ€™s rings are not solid. They are made up of particles of rock, ice, and dust. Some of the particles are as tiny as grains of sand. Others are as large as skyscrapers. Although the rings are wide, they are also very thin. The planetâ€™s rings are only about half a mile thick. In addition to learning about the rings, scientists are studying Saturnâ€™s moons. The scientistsâ€™ primary focus is Saturnâ€™s largest moon, Titan. Titan is larger than the planets Mercury and Pluto. In December, Cassini will release its probe, called Huygens (HOY-ginz). The probe will parachute through the murky atmosphere of Titan and land on its surface. That will be the most far-reaching landing that a spacecraft has ever made from our planet. Scientists are interested in Titan because they think it might teach them about Earth. Experts used to think that Titan resembled Earth as it was billions of years ago. They are starting to question that idea. What do scientists expect to find? ""In many ways, the most exciting part of the journey is about to begin because we donâ€™t know what lies ahead,"" said NASA scientist Julie Webster. Earth and the other planets in our solar system travel around the sun. Saturn is so far from the sun that it receives less sunlight than we get on Earth. The sun also looks much smaller from Saturn. Do you think it is important for scientists to explore space? Why or why not?"	4
"Astronauts are diving into a new kind of mission. Their special voyage is taking them more than 60 feet beneath the ocean's surface. The astronauts--called ""aquanauts""--are training for space missions in an underwater laboratory called Aquarius. The lab rests on the ocean floor off the coast of Florida. The latest ocean mission began October 11, when three astronauts and a doctor from Canada took the plunge. The crew's job includes testing medical equipment that may be used to treat astronauts when they get sick in space. The journey marks the seventh mission the U.S. space agency, NASA, has made to Aquarius. The 10-day mission is referred to as NEEMO 7 (NASA Extreme Environment Mission Operations). Astronauts are using the underwater lab to learn what it may be like to live and work in space. They are preparing for extreme environments, such as the moon and the planet Mars. The conditions underwater are similar to those in space. The goal of this latest voyage, or expedition, is to learn how to treat patients in space from a distance. Part of the underwater mission involves performing robotic surgery on a fake patient. Doctors on land have guided the astronauts through the procedure. Why is exploring this technology important? ""Astronauts navigating between planets won't be able to turn around and come home when someone gets sick,"" said NEEMO's project manager, Bill Todd, ""and this undersea mission will help us [respond to medical emergencies in space]."" Aquarius is the only underwater training center and research laboratory of its kind. The astronauts live, sleep, and work there. The lab, which is 45 feet long, has some of the comforts of home. Aquarius is equipped with bunks, a shower, computers, and even a refrigerator and microwave. Plus it has an ocean view!"	4
A sheep named Shrek got the wool pulled over his eyes. Last April, the 10-year-old male woolly sheep from New Zealand finally got a haircut after six years. Sheep are abundant on the islands of New Zealand, which are located southeast of Australia in the Pacific Ocean. After years of roaming in the wild, Shrek was caught. Sixty pounds of Shrek's wool was sheared, or cut, with scissors before a crowd on television. That was enough wool to make 20 suits! Shearers left a thin layer of wool on Shrek and gave him a special coat to keep him warm. Shrek's owner donated the wool to a charity for children. When students at the Tarras School in New Zealand learned of Shrek, they created a children's book called Shrek: The Famous Hermit Sheep of Tarras. Their book tells the story of Shrek through the eyes of children who have followed his life from long hair to no hair. Students sold the book at a school fundraiser. The book was such a huge hit that the first 8,000 copies sold in no time and the publisher had to print more!	4
"During the five-day event, money was displayed for looking at, buying, and selling. Some coins were worth as little as half a cent. Other coins were worth millions. The event drew thousands of coin lovers from around the world. That's not surprising--coin collecting is one of the world's most popular hobbies. Some people collect coins as an investment, or a way to make money in the future. Most collectors, however, are not in it for the money. They participate in the hobby because of each coin's story. One coin expert referred to money as ""history that you can hold in your hand."" Among the fair's most valuable coins were two Liberty Head nickels. The nickels were worth between $2 million and $3 million each. A 1794 coin couldn't be missed at the fair either. Experts say the coin, believed to be the first silver dollar in the United States, is worth about $10 million. Coin hobbyists point out that just because a coin is old doesn't necessarily mean it's valuable. A coin's worth depends on how many exist, on how many people want it, and on its condition. Coin collectors are used to paying more for a coin than its original value. They say their hobby is worth every penny."	4
No, this isn't a scene from the movies. A submarine designer is planning to build a new hotel in the Bahamas in which half the rooms will be underwater. The Poseidon Undersea Resort is expected to open late next year. In the hotel's most expensive rooms, guests will be able to watch ocean life outside their windows. Visitors won't need to dive to their accommodations. They can reach their rooms from a tunnel on the beach.	4
"Have you ever dreamed of traveling into outer space? Thanks to a team of inventors who have set their sights high, that reality may be closer than you think. A rocket plane called SpaceShipOne launched into the record books in October. It became the first private spacecraft to carry humans into space and back twice within one week. The SpaceShipOne team won a $10 million prize for its record-breaking feat. Called the Ansari X Prize, it was designed to encourage people to build spacecraft to take paying tourists into space. SpaceShipOne is not the first spacecraft to travel into space. However, it is the first one that was built and launched without help from the government. The U.S. space agency, NASA, sends people into space. About the size of a minivan, SpaceShipOne took off from a runway in California's Mojave Desert. It was attached beneath a carrier plane called White Knight. At 9 miles up, SpaceShipOne blasted free of the carrier plane. Then SpaceShipOne fired its rocket engine and streaked skyward to an altitude, or height, of nearly 70 miles. It broke through Earth's atmosphere at 62 miles high. This height is considered the point where space begins. SpaceShipOne blasted into the edge of space at three times the speed of sound. Sound travels about 700 miles per hour. About an hour and a half after takeoff, pilot Brian Binnie glided the rocket plane to a smooth landing on the desert runway. Thousands of people gathered to watch the mission, which Binnie described as ""fantastic."" To win the $10 million prize, the spacecraft's team had to meet several requirements. The craft had to reach the edge of space twice within a two-week period and carry the weight of three people, including the pilot. SpaceShipOne beat out 26 teams that had entered to compete for the prize. In December 1903, the Wright brothers launched the age of aviation, or flight. They made the world's first powered flight in Kitty Hawk, North Carolina. Flash-forward a little more than a century later, and a new milestone in aviation history has been reached. ""This is the true frontier of transportation,"" Marion Blakey, the head of the Federal Aviation Administration, told The Associated Press. ""It feels a little bit like Kitty Hawk must have."" Would you want to travel as a space tourist? Why or why not? What does the future hold? A British airline owner wants his company to use SpaceShipOne technology to take paying tourists into space by 2007. Officials say the flights of SpaceShipOne marked the beginning of the space tourism industry. ""Today, history was made,"" said Peter Diamandis, the founder of the Ansari X Prize. ""We're at the birth of a new era [in spaceflight.]"""	4
"The star-nosed mole has earned the nickname ""motormouth"" for a good reason. Researchers discovered that it can scarf down a meal in one-quarter of a second! They believe the mole is the world's fastest-eating mammal. The strange-looking creature is found in wetlands from southeastern Canada to Georgia. The 22 fleshy rays that make up its nose help the mole feel around in the dark for its favorite meal—earthworms!"	4
"Playgrounds have been on John Dark's mind lately. The teen from Jackson, Michigan, has been raising money to buy a playground for children in Afghanistan. John started the effort through his church and hopes to help hundreds of schoolchildren in that war-torn country. His goal is to raise $30,000 to purchase and deliver the playground to an elementary school located outside Kabul, the country's capital. The school has 800 students. Where did he get the idea for his project? ""I've seen on the news and read newspaper and magazine articles about how people are trying to rebuild Afghanistan--in particular, the schools,"" John said. ""I thought 'Now, what does every school need? That's right, a safe playground!'"" So far, John has raised more than $7,000. The not-for-profit organization AmeriCares will help ship the playground to the school in Afghanistan when John finishes raising the money. The playground equipment will include swings, slides, and monkey bars."	4
"Jenna and Cayden Boyd say they are no different from most sisters and brothers. ""We fight sometimes,"" Jenna told Weekly Reader. Unlike most siblings, however, this duo is starring in two movies that will open within one week. Twelve-year-old Jenna stars in the movie The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants, which is scheduled to hit theaters June 3. On June 10, her younger brother, 10-year-old Cayden, stars in The Adventures of Shark Boy and Lava Girl in 3-D. ""It's going to be so weird,"" said Jenna. ""It will be my turn, and then it will be his turn."" Both siblings prepared for challenging roles. In her film, Jenna plays a young girl named Bailey, who deals with a serious illness. In his movie, Cayden stars as a lonely boy named Max, who shares a memorable summer with two imaginary superhero friends. ""It's a dream come true, literally,"" Cayden said about the role. ""In the movie, Max's dreams come true. And in real life, my dreams have come true."" So does Jenna hope to work on a movie with her younger brother someday? ""I think it would actually be fun,"" she said."	4
"Congress recently took a mighty swing at baseball. Lawmakers want Major League Baseball to step up to the plate and crack down on steroid abuse in the sport. In March, some of baseball's current and former sluggers testified about steroid use before Congress. Steroids are drugs that build up muscles to allow players to work out longer than they normally could. Doctors sometimes prescribe steroids to treat some serious illnesses. Taking steroids without a prescription is illegal and can be very dangerous. Did some of baseball's top players cheat by taking steroids illegally? Among the players appearing before Congress were former stars Jose Canseco and Mark McGwire. Canseco wrote a book admitting to using steroids and accused other players, including McGwire, of steroid use. During the hearing, McGwire, a top home run hitter, refused to say whether he used steroids but acknowledged ""there has been a problem with steroid use in baseball."" Baltimore Orioles players Sammy Sosa and Rafael Palmeiro also spoke and denied charges. ""I have never used steroids. Period,"" Palmeiro told Congress. Congress wants Major League Baseball to punish players who are caught using steroids. ""There's a cloud over the game I love,"" said lawmaker Tom Davis of Virginia. This season, the sport will conduct random tests for steroid use. First-time offenders will be suspended, or temporarily forbidden to play, for 10 games. Last year Jason Giambi of the New York Yankees admitted to steroid use. San Francisco Giants superstar Barry Bonds has also been suspected of using steroids. In 2001, Bonds broke McGwire's record for the most home runs in a single season. Lawmakers say that baseball is setting a bad example for kids, who often look up to players as role models. Do you think the records of players who use steroids should be disqualified? Why or why not?"	4
Scientists in England have invented a cell phone that turns into a sunflower. The cell phone's cover is made out of biodegradable plastic, which breaks down naturally when it is buried in soil. Then a seed inside the cover sprouts into a sunflower. About 25 million cell phones will be thrown out this year. Scientists hope the environmentally friendly covers will reduce the amount of plastic that ends up in landfills. Phones with the new cover may be for sale within the next year.	4
On November 2, voters will decide whom they want to be the next U.S. president. Will it be Republican George W. Bush or Democrat John Kerry? To find out what the candidates have to say about some of the election issues, Weekly Reader (WR) went right to the source. Bush: My administration has put in place some of the most important antipollution policies in a decade. I have a responsibility as the president to put people in my administration [who] understand the importance of conserving our natural resources and making them better. Kerry: As Americans, we have the right to breathe unpolluted air and drink safe water. Across America, we will guarantee all children access to clean, safe parks and baseball fields and take on traffic congestion. We will protect the health of all Americans by [improving air quality]. Bush: I believe every child can learn and every school must teach--so we passed the most important federal education [law] in history. Because we acted, children are making progress in reading and math, America's schools are getting better, and nothing will hold us back. Kerry: Every child should be held to high standards. Every classroom should have a great teacher. Every young person should graduate [from] high school, and every young person who works hard and wants to go to college should be able to afford it. Bush: We're working closely with Iraqi citizens as they prepare a constitution, as they move toward free elections and take increasing responsibility for their own affairs. Securing democracy in Iraq is the work of many hands. Kerry: Our military performed brilliantly in ending the regime of Saddam Hussein. Having gone to war, we cannot afford to fail at peace. The United States must take immediate measures to prevent Iraq from becoming a failed state. Although the presidential candidates have been in the spotlight, they aren't the only people running for office on Election Day. On November 2, Americans will also vote to elect members to Congress. Congress is the branch of the U.S. government that makes the laws. It is made up of the Senate and the House of Representatives. Just like the presidential candidates, most senators and representatives belong to either the Republican Party or the Democratic Party. The winners of the Senate and House elections can affect the balance of power between the two main political parties in Congress. That can impact which laws get passed. All 435 seats in the U.S. House of Representatives are up for election this year. Representatives are elected to two-year terms. There is no limit to how many times they can run for reelection. Republicans have a 12-seat lead in the House. They have held the majority in Congress since 1994. In the U.S. Senate, 34 of the 100 seats are up for election. Every state has two senators, who are elected for six-year terms. There is also no limit on how many terms a senator can serve. The Republican Party has a one-seat lead in the Senate. Which issue is most important to you and your family? Why?	4
"Some people in southern France have been driving through the clouds. They have been traveling across the world's tallest bridge, located in the French city of Millau. The president of France, Jacques Chirac, joined the celebration to open the bridge in December. He called the viaduct a ""marvel of art and architecture."" A viaduct is a bridge that carries a road or a railroad track over dry land and that is supported on columns. The Millau Viaduct stretches 1.6 miles across the Tarn River valley. ""The bridge is just on the clouds,"" the mayor of Millau told reporters. Soaring 1,125 feet high to the top of its tallest column, the bridge is more than 50 feet taller than the Eiffel Tower. That structure is located in Paris, the capital of France. British architect Norman Foster designed the steel-and-concrete bridge. He describes its design as having ""the delicacy of a butterfly."" The bridge was built to prevent traffic jams between Paris and the southern coast of France in the summer. Many people head to beaches on the Mediterranean Sea at that time of year."	4
"Eleven-year-old Josh Cook from Ohio became hooked on pocket bike racing last year. Josh races his pocket bike, or mini motorcycle, on a private track. He also makes sure to wear protective gear and safety equipment, such as a helmet and heavy boots, whenever he rides. Pocket bikes, also called pocket rockets, have found their way onto city streets. Pocket bikes are the most recent craze sweeping the country. Yet this pint-size fun is causing big trouble. Police in cities from Los Angeles to Boston are concerned about the safety of kids riding the popular pocket bikes. At less than 2 feet tall, the mini motorcycles are low to the ground. ""The minibikes are extremely dangerous,"" Los Angeles police officer Ron Fisher told Weekly Reader. ""They are so low to the ground that it makes the rider invisible from a driverâ€™s viewpoint."" The mini motorcycles, which are powered by lawn mower engines, are also noisy. They typically reach speeds between 25 and 40 miles an hour. That is about the same speed a car travels on local streets. Although it is legal to buy the bikes, it is against the law to ride them on public streets in many states. Police have been giving tickets to illegal riders. In some cases, officers seize, or take away, the bikes. This has some kids and parents upset. They argue that the companies selling the mini motorcycles donâ€™t inform buyers that they canâ€™t be ridden on public streets. Fisher says the majority of pocket bike riders on the street are 9 and 10 years old. Officials in some states are working to pass laws to limit who can ride the bikes. The officials say that kids should have to wait until they have a driverâ€™s license. Pocket bike racing has been a popular sport in Europe. It has caught on in some communities in the United States during the past few years. Josh and other pocket bike racers agree that the mini motorcycles are not meant to be ridden on city streets. He told us that if people are interested in riding pocket bikes, they should find ""an organized race track."" Do you think kids should be allowed to ride pocket bikes on public streets? Why or why not?"	4
"A group of fourth graders witnessed firsthand proof that one person's junk is another person's treasure. Weekly Reader joined the students on their recent visit to the Garbage Museum in Stratford, Connecticut, where a giant, multicolored dinosaur molded out of garbage towered above them. Trash-o-saurus was sculpted out of a ton of trash! That is equal to 2,000 pounds of garbage—the amount of trash each person, on average, throws away each year. Philadelphia artist Leo Sewell scoured city dumps and created Trash-o-saurus out of old junk, from false teeth and license plates to toys, tires, and tennis rackets. ""I think the dinosaur is one of the coolest things I've ever seen,"" said fourth grader Jahkwe Aquart from Park City Magnet School in Bridgeport, Connecticut. His classmate Julie Pham, 9, agreed. ""Instead of throwing away our garbage, we can reuse it."" That is exactly the point. ""The museum shows what happens to our trash, how we can reduce our trash, and what we can do instead of throwing our trash away,"" said museum director Sotoria Montanari. Today, Americans create more garbage than ever before. In the early 1900s, most items were packed in containers that could be used again. Now, most of the food we buy, from cereal to milk, comes in boxes and cartons that can be thrown away. So what happens to trash after it is tossed out? Some trash ends up in landfills. In a landfill, garbage gets buried between layers of soil. Because many states are running out of room for landfills, more and more garbage goes to waste-to-energy (or resource-recovery) plants. At these plants, garbage is burned and converted into electricity that people use to power their lights, TVs, and video games. Garbage is a form of solid waste. The Garbage Museum and its recycling plant, which are run by the Connecticut Resources Recovery Authority, provide visitors with ideas to cut down on solid waste. One way is to reduce, or make less, trash—by throwing away fewer napkins when you eat, for instance. Another way is to reuse, or find new uses for, old items. Paper bags, for example, can be reused to make book covers or wrap gifts. People also help decrease their solid wastes when they recycle. Recycling refers to putting old objects, such as glass, plastic bottles, newspapers, and aluminum cans through a special process so they can be used again. (See ""Get in the Loop!"") Recycling has many benefits. Did you know that recycled plastic soft-drink bottles can be made into park benches, carpeting, and backpacks? The more people recycle, the less garbage ends up in landfills or waste-to-energy plants. Recycling also helps protect natural resources, or materials from Earth. To make an aluminum can from scratch, for example, the metal needs to be mined from the ground. That process harms the land and pollutes the air and water. Making aluminum cans from recycled cans uses 95 percent less energy and protects Earth's natural resources. In fact, the energy saved each year from recycled cans could light Washington, D.C., for nearly four years! As part of their visit, the fourth graders got a look at the museum's recycling center. Here, they discovered that one bale, or bundle, of recycled newspapers can save 17 trees! The message seems to have stuck with 9-year-old Arron Smith. ""When you recycle, you save trees and animals' homes."" Did you ever wonder what happens to the aluminum cans you recycle? Weekly Reader watched a recycling center in action at the Garbage Museum. 1. Sort and Separate. Trucks drop off aluminum cans that are mixed with massive loads of plastic bottles and glass. The trash travels along conveyor belts to be sorted and separated. 2. Compress the Mess. Machines compress aluminum cans into giant bales. 3. Close the Loop. The bales are sold to companies that turn the recycled cans into something usable. From recycled aluminum cans, more cans are made. When you buy recycled products, you ""close the loop."" Each American throws away about 5 pounds of garbage each day. Earth Day, April 22, reminds people how important it is to reduce waste. Here are some ways:"	4
"They were there to celebrate the grand opening of the National Museum of the American Indian. The new museum is part of the Smithsonian Institution. It is located on the National Mall, near the U.S. Capitol. ""[The new museum] is a living tribute to the first Americans,"" museum director W. Richard West Jr. told the crowd. West is a member of the Southern Cheyenne tribe. Native Americans from Alaska to South America united, or came together, for the museum's opening. A six-day festival followed the opening ceremony. The festival featured Native American dancing, music, foods, and storytelling. The museum is dedicated to the life, culture, and traditions of Native Americans. It tells the stories and struggles of tribes throughout North, South, and Central America. Ten-year-old Jessica Lovato, from the Santa Clara Pueblo tribe in New Mexico, joined the celebration. To her, visiting the museum was ""a great learning experience!"" A wealthy New Yorker named George Gustav Heye collected most of the new museum's items throughout the early 1900s. He was interested in Native American culture and traditions. There are about 800,000 Native American objects included in the museum's collection. The museum plans to display about 8,000 artifacts at a time. The 4 million people who are expected to visit each year won't just find ancient objects--although there are plenty of them to see. Officials say the new museum also teaches people about Native Americans in modern times. Along with ancient pieces, such as beadwork, pottery, and carvings, visitors will also find newer ones, such as modern art and beaded sneakers. The museum has been a work in progress for 16 years. Twenty-four Native American tribes helped build and plan the museum. They even reviewed the traditional dishes served in the museum's café. Symbolism abounds in the five-story building, which is made of limestone from Minnesota. The building's curved exterior resembles rocks shaped by wind and water over thousands of years. In honor of many types of Native American dwellings, the museum's entrance faces east, in the direction of the rising sun. Inside, an electronic welcome sign greets visitors in 150 Native American languages. Native Americans are not one group of people. There are more than 562 Native American tribes in the United States today, each with its own culture. Native Americans have lived in North, South, and Central America for more than 20,000 years. When European explorers first arrived in North America, they thought they had landed in the East Indies. Those are islands located near Asia. That is why the explorers called the people living in the Americas ""Indians."" To many Native Americans, the new museum has been a long time coming. ""[It is] long overdue,"" said Lawrence Small, secretary of the Smithsonian Institution. Now that it is officially open, Native Americans hope the new museum keeps their culture alive. ""This will be a good education tool for everyone that wants to learn about the Indian people,"" a Cherokee woman told USA Today. ""Our languages are still here. Our culture is still here."""	4
"Top Thrill Dragster is the worlds second fastest roller coaster. It is topped only by Kingda Ka. As you wait in line, you hear the screams of people riding Kingda Ka. Part of you can't wait to ride the roller coaster; another part of you wants to bolt in the opposite direction. Before you know it, it's your turn to board. You brace yourself. Whoosh! With a roaring blast, the thrill ride rockets from 0 to 128 miles per hour in 3.5 seconds. Before you can catch your breath, the train whisks you straight up 456 feet. When it can go no farther, gravity plummets the coaster downward into a dizzying spiral twist. The train then whips you through another valley and zooms up another hill. Congratulations! You have just experienced the fastest—and tallest—roller coaster on Earth. Kingda Ka, or the ""King of Coasters,"" opens this spring at the Six Flags Great Adventure theme park in Jackson, New Jersey. The jaw-dropping thrill ride shatters the world's record for roller coaster speed and height. Of the more than 1,000 roller coasters in the United States, it is the latest ""extreme"" coaster to be built. Six Flags roller coaster designer Larry Chickola says building Kingda Ka wasn't easy. ""We considered the wind strength, the possibility of earthquakes, the weight of Kingda Ka itself, as well as the forces caused by launching a [coaster faster than one] has ever gone,"" he told Weekly Reader. Changes in energy enable roller coasters like Kingda Ka to move for most of the ride. According to scientists, energy is the ability to cause change. At the beginning of the ride, Kingda Ka blasts passengers to a speed of 128 miles an hour with technology similar to the kind that launches Navy jets from aircraft carriers. Each train on Kingda Ka is hooked up to a hydraulic cable. Liquid under high pressure is pushed through the cable. Along with motors, the hydraulic power rockets the coaster skyward. After reaching the top of the first hill, the coaster works in the same way your bike does when you roll, pedal-free, down a slope. When a roller coaster is stopped, it has potential energy, or stored energy. At any moment, the coaster can move, so it has the potential for motion. As the roller coaster starts cruising, gravity takes over and converts the potential energy into kinetic energy, which is the energy of motion. The repeated changes of potential energy to kinetic energy and then back again drives the roller coaster. Kingda Ka covers 3,118 feet of track and lasts less than a minute. To roller coaster buff Steve Urbanowicz from New Jersey, the new ride is a scream! ""The ride seems like it's over really quickly, but Kingda Ka packs eight high moments of drama into those 50 seconds,"" he told Weekly Reader. Urbanowicz, 46, speaks from experience. He has ridden 876 roller coasters around the world. In fact, he has taken more than 5,000 rides on one in particular—the wooden Cyclone at Coney Island in Brooklyn, New York, where the first true American coaster opened in 1884. ""I loved going to amusement parks when I was a kid and never grew out of it."""	4
"Scientists recently counted animals at New York City's Bronx Zoo from a bird's-eye view--280 miles above Earth! The animals were tracked with a satellite called QuickBird. A satellite is a spacecraft that orbits a planet. U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service The satellite took images of the zoo animals and sent them back to Earth. The scientists studied the images to see how accurately the satellite was able to spot different species of zoo animals, such as giraffes. So far, the scientists are impressed with the results. They hope to use the satellite technology to track endangered wildlife in remote, or hard-to-reach, places around the world. Endangered animals are at risk of becoming extinct, or dying out completely. Scientists have used satellites to track animals in the past. However, this is the first time the technology has been used on such a broad variety of animals. ""Previously, three species--walruses, African elephants, and emperor penguins--have been looked at using satellite technology,"" said Bergen. ""Part of this experiment is to see how many other species can be looked at with this technology."" The next step is to see how well the satellite can count animals in the wild. Scientists plan to start testing the technology in the wild within the year."	4
"Archaeologists in northwestern England are thrilled about a rare find. The scientists recently unearthed a burial site of six Viking men and women. They discovered swords, spears, jewelry, and other artifacts. The site was excavated, or dug up, after a metal detector user discovered two copper brooches in the ground. The worker informed archaeologists, who believe the site dates back to the 10th century. It is one of only a few Viking cemeteries found in England. The Vikings were pirates and warriors, known for their sea faring voyages. From the late 700s to 1100, the Vikings lived in Scandinavia. That region of Europe includes the present-day countries of Denmark, Norway, and Sweden. Viking sailors spread fear throughout Europe. They raided and conquered coastal villages in Europe and along the Mediterranean coast. During their raids, Vikings captured slaves. They also pillaged, or stole, treasures, such as silver and gold. For their voyages, Viking sailors crafted swift, narrow longships that could navigate the stormiest seas. The Vikings were the master shipbuilders of their time. Vikings also worked as farmers and craftspeople. Others hunted and fished. The Vikings' claim to fame may have been their fearsome raids, but they were explorers and traders too. They were among the earliest explorers to travel across the Atlantic Ocean to North America. One of the most famous Vikings was explorer Leif Eriksson. He reached North America almost 500 years before Columbus arrived in 1492. Over time, the Viking raiders lost their power as people learned to defend against their attacks. Today, the remains of Viking villages can be found throughout Europe and North America. Archaeologists plan to study the burial ground in England to learn more about the life of the Vikings. Based on the objects found, they believe the site was once a Viking settlement. Vikings were known to bury valuable items with the dead. As one historian put it, the site will allow experts to ""uncover the secrets of a time capsule more than 1,000 years old."""	4
"After nearly two decades of rest, a sleeping giant has started to awaken. Mount St. Helens in Washington state is showing signs of life and has left scientists scrambling to determine if it will blow its top. ""Volcanoes are just like people--they're awake and active, and they go to sleep,"" volcanologist Carolyn Driedger told Weekly Reader. A volcanologist is a scientist who studies volcanoes. In September, Mount St. Helens began blowing large plumes, or clouds of steam, thousands of feet into the air. The 8,364-foot mountain is not the only restless volcano in the country. Scientists are also paying close attention to awakened volcanoes in Alaska and Hawaii. Volcanoes can remain quiet for years and then erupt violently, sometimes without warning. Using the latest technology, scientists hope to better forecast, or predict, eruptions. Scientists say Mount St. Helens is one of the most closely monitored volcanoes and the most active volcano in the lower 48 states. Mount St. Helens is also among 13 active volcanoes that are located in the Cascade Range in the Pacific Northwest. That range is home to several powerful volcanoes, such as Mount Rainier and Mount Hood. Although scientists say a large eruption at Mount St. Helens is unlikely, they are cautious because of the volcano's history. Officials have sealed off a 5-mile area around the volcano. Mount St. Helens erupted with tremendous force in May 1980, blowing more than 1,300 feet off its top and killing 57 people. The blast destroyed thousands of acres of forest and scattered ash for thousands of miles. Mount St. Helens continued to rumble until 1986 but has been quiet since that time. How can scientists tell when a volcano will awaken from its slumber? ""We measure earthquake activity, changes in the mountain, and volcanic gases,"" said Driedger. Although scientists can't tell exactly when or with what force a volcano will blow its top, they rely on advanced equipment to help them predict eruptions. Special devices called seismometers are installed around volcanoes such as Mount St. Helens to detect earthquakes. Earthquakes always strike before a volcano erupts. Volcanoes are mountains where hot, liquid rock called magma deep inside Earth builds up in chambers. Heat and pressure can cause magma, gases, ash, steam, and other materials to blast out of the crater at the top of the volcano and vents, or cracks, along its side. When magma reaches the surface of the volcano, it is called lava. Once lava cools, it hardens into rock. Scientists use special global positioning instruments to measure movements on the slopes of the mountain--a clue to the buildup of magma. Magma is red-hot molten rock located inside the volcano. It is called lava when it pours out of the volcano. As magma rises, volcanoes release carbon dioxide and other gases into the air. Sensors on helicopters test the air for gases that signal rising magma. ""The gases are like telegrams that tell us what's going on inside the volcano,"" said Driedger. More than 500 million people around the world live near active volcanoes. Monitoring volcanoes is a dangerous job, but scientists take precautions to stay safe. ""By watching volcanoes, we learn how they work,"" said Driedger. ""The more we know, the better prepared we can be to save property and lives."" Besides volcanoes, what natural disasters are hard for scientists to predict? Why?"	4
"""Congratulations, Mr. President,"" Senator John Kerry said to George W. Bush in a phone call the morning after Election Day last November. In the close election, President Bush had beaten Kerry, his Democratic opponent. On January 20, 2005, President Bush will be sworn in to office for a second time. That is Inauguration Day, which marks the beginning of a president's term. A term is the four-year period the president serves in office. The presidential inauguration, or ceremony, begins at noon in the country's capital, Washington, D.C. Thousands of people will gather to hear President Bush take the Oath of Office on the steps of the U.S. Capitol. Millions of people will also watch the ceremony on television and on the Internet. The oath is the promise the president makes to lead the country and uphold its laws. Bush will recite, or publicly say, the oath that is written in the U.S. Constitution. (See ""Presidential Oath of Office."") After the oath, President Bush will give an inaugural address. In that speech, he will speak to all Americans about his plans for the country's future. After the speech, huge crowds will line the streets as the president makes his way along Pennsylvania Avenue in a parade from the U.S. Capitol to the White House. That night, the president and his wife, Laura Bush, will attend festive parties called inaugural balls. The oath is the only Inauguration Day event required by law. Every president since George Washington has taken the oath. On April 30, 1789, Washington was inaugurated at Federal Hall in New York City, which was then the country's capital. In 1801, Thomas Jefferson was the first president to be inaugurated in Washington, D.C. In 1809, the first organized inaugural ball was held in Washington, D.C., for James Madison. In 1817, James Monroe's inauguration was the first to be held entirely outdoors. Over the years, inauguration traditions have evolved from simple events to elaborate ceremonies. Since George Washington's time, presidents have used inaugural addresses to unite the country and inspire people. Abraham Lincoln gave his second inaugural speech in 1865, not long before the Civil War ended. He used his speech to draw the country together. Other presidents' inaugural words are still quoted today. When Franklin D. Roosevelt delivered his first inaugural speech in 1933, the United States was at the height of the Great Depression. That was a time when many people were out of work. He brought promise with his words ""The only thing we have to fear is fear itself."" When John F. Kennedy took office in 1961, he encouraged people to help their country. His speech challenged Americans: ""Ask not what your country can do for you; ask what you can do for your country."" What message will President Bush convey? He will likely continue the message expressed in his victory speech. ""A new term is a new opportunity to reach out to the whole nation,"" he said. ""We have one country, one Constitution, and one future that binds us. And when we come together and work together, there is no limit to the greatness of America."""	4
"Alex Warhall is on a roll! The 11-year-old boy regularly practices his kickflip and heelflip at a skate park in his neighborhood in New Haven, Connecticut. If kickflip and heelflip aren't in your vocabulary, welcome to the world of skateboarding. Both are skateboarding tricks. Alex is one of millions of kids who have made skateboarding one of the fastest-growing sports. There are an estimated 12 million skateboarders in the United States. The number of girls who have gotten in on the action has also grown. Thanks in part to the X Games and top skating athlete Tony Hawk, skateboarding has exploded in popularity. What is so appealing about the sport? ""I like to skateboard because when I see people at the skate parks and on television, I think I can be that good someday,"" Alex told Weekly Reader. Although kids like Alex may be riding for the thrill of the sport, experts say skateboarding is a great form of exercise. It gets kids moving and keeps them in shape. The benefits don't stop there either. Skateboarding builds concentration skills and motivates kids to persevere, or to keep trying, to learn a new skill. Although Alex also plays baseball and basketball, team sports are not for all kids. Skateboarding lets kids stay active and have fun without the pressure of a team sport. Skateboarding traces its roots to southern California. At one time, the sport got a bad rap for being a hazardous, or dangerous, activity. Before towns and cities across the country built skate parks, many skateboarders were injured on public streets. They often performed tricks down stairs and across railings on buildings. Today, the sport's reputation is getting a lift. The skate park in New Haven where Alex practices is one of more than 1,000 that have popped up nationwide in recent years. Skate parks contain ramps and other devices for kids to hone, or improve, their skills. Officials hope that skate parks will encourage skaters to practice in a safe environment. Although most skate parks require riders to wear helmets and other safety gear, it's hard to avoid the occasional cut. Many skateboarders, however, are quick to point out that their sport is no more dangerous than bike riding or football. For Alex, skateboarding gives him a chance to spend time with his friends. ""It's really fun!"" he says. Wheel sports--skateboarding, bike riding, and in-line skating--can be a lot of fun. They are also good ways to get moving. Follow these tips for a safe ride:"	4
Dentists recently went ape for a gorilla named Koko. The 33-year-old gorilla used American Sign Language to complain about a toothache. Sign language is a form of communication made up of hand movements, facial expressions, and body movements used in place of speech. The gestures have different meanings. Koko's teacher and other workers at the Gorilla Foundation in California, where she lives, jumped to her rescue. They showed her a pain chart with the numbers 1 through 10 written on it. Koko pointed to a 9 on the chart to let them know how much her tooth hurt. Koko is one smart animal! She knows how to sign about 1,000 words and can understand about 2,000 words of spoken English. Dentists took good care of Koko. They extracted, or removed, her sore tooth. She is feeling much better now and has since gotten a clean bill of health.	4
"Scientists say lightning strikes the surface of Earth about 100 times each second. Thunderstorms are most frequent during the spring and summer. During those seasons, experts warn people to be especially aware of the dangers of lightning. Lightning is the flash of light that occurs when electricity moves between clouds or between a cloud and the ground. The huge spark of electricity is like the tiny kind you get when you run a comb through your hair or scuff your feet on a carpet—only much stronger. A lightning bolt that crackles through the air can reach a temperature of 60,000 degrees Fahrenheit. That is about five times hotter than the sun! The intense heat from lightning causes the surrounding air to expand, resulting in the loud sound known as thunder. Thunder is nature's warning to head indoors. As meteorologist Ron Holle from Tucson, Arizona, told Weekly Reader, ""When thunder roars, go indoors."" A meteorologist is a scientist who studies weather. Holle also recommends following the 30-30 rule. If you hear thunder less than 30 seconds after you see lightning, head indoors—the storm is only about 6 miles away. After the storm ends, wait 30 minutes before going outside. To determine how far away lightning is, count the seconds between the flash and the thunder. Every 10 seconds equals 2 miles. Lightning strikes the ground in the United States about 25 million times each year! Although getting hit by lightning is unlikely, it is important to stay safe. In the United States, about 60 people are killed each year by lightning. To stay safe, follow the golden rule—head for cover. ""There is no place outside that is safe from lightning,"" Holle said firmly. ""There are two safe places—inside a [permanent] building or a metal-topped vehicle."""	4
"Counting giant pandas in the wild is no easy task. Just ask a team of scientists who recently put their detective skills to the test. The scientists trekked through dense forests in central China to search for clues of giant pandas. China, a country in Asia, is the only place where giant pandas live in the wild. After spending four years in the country's mountainous region, scientists completed the largest census of giant pandas ever done. A census is a population count. The results of the census surprised scientists! They counted about 1,600 giant pandas living in the wild in China. That is double the number originally thought to live there. ""We found giant pandas living in areas we didn't know had any,"" scientist Colby Loucks told Weekly Reader. Although the news is hopeful, Loucks and other scientists are quick to point out that giant pandas still need protection. They are among the most endangered animals. That means there are very few left in the wild. Human activity is the main reason the pandas are threatened. Their habitat, or home, is being destroyed as people cut down trees to get wood and to make farmland. Scientists needed to collect clues to count pandas because the shy creatures are hard to spot in their natural environment. ""Giant pandas are very hard to see in the wild,"" said Loucks. ""They hide in the thick bamboo forests."" Bamboo provides giant pandas with their main source of food. Each animal consumes about 80 pounds of this plant's stems and leaves a day. In fact, the giant pandas' survival is linked to eating bamboo. If bamboo disappears in an area, giant pandas there risk starvation. To collect clues, scientists combined the latest technology with old-fashioned tracking skills. Each time they spotted a clue, such as a panda paw print in the mud or fur on the bark of a tree, they entered their finding into a computer. Computer mapping helped them pinpoint the locations of the giant pandas. How will the census results help protect pandas? Scientists hope their findings will lead to the creation of more nature reserves for giant pandas. Nature reserves are areas of forest that are protected from development. Currently, China has 40 nature reserves. ""Pandas live in the same place as other animals,"" said Loucks. ""If we conserve the panda habitat, we conserve [the habitat of other animals] too."""	4
"Live from New York ... except this time, it wasn't! Pop singer Ashlee Simpson, the younger sister of singer Jessica Simpson, was caught lip-synching on the TV program Saturday Night Live in October. Lip-synching is mouthing the words or singing along to a recording. Some performers sing along to a prerecorded track to make their voice sound stronger. A computer glitch was to blame for Simpson's mix-up on Saturday Night Live. Simpson, 20, was caught lip-synching when the words to the wrong song began playing. Simpson's dad rushed to her defense after the incident. He said his daughter was lip-synching because an upset stomach had made her voice hoarse. ""Every artist that I know in this business has had vocal problems at some time,"" he told The Associated Press. ""So you've got to do what you've got to do."" An embarrassed Simpson apologized to her fans but said she hadn't done anything different from what many other artists do. Some music industry officials defend the practice. They say it's nearly impossible to sound good and sing on cue when you're dancing onstage or performing complicated acts. Difficult dance moves are not an excuse for lip-synching, say many fans. In fact, some fans say lip-synching is a dishonest practice that hurts a singer's credibility. Fans often question a star's talent if the singer is unable to perform live onstage. They say most people can sound good on a CD if their voice is enhanced in a studio. Some concertgoers also feel betrayed and disappointed if an artist lip-synchs, especially when they have spent a lot of money on a ticket to hear a live performance."	4
"The hurricane left thousands of people homeless. Now people across America are reaching out to help the Gulf Coast rebuild. Getting the Gulf Coast back on its feet after Hurricane Katrina is going to be a challenge. It is expected to take months in some places, and in others, years. Thousands of people who fled the storm weeks ago are still wondering when they can go home—if they still have a home. Across the country, other people are rebuilding their lives in new neighborhoods. ""The devastation is greater than our worst fears,"" says Louisiana Governor Kathleen Blanco. ""It's just totally overwhelming."" Officials are now developing plans to repair the roads, bridges, houses, and buildings the storm washed away. Congress approved billions of dollars in aid. Companies in the United States have donated millions to the relief efforts. Government officials have also been working on providing housing, schools, and jobs to those who evacuated, or fled, New Orleans. ""Our hearts go out to people, our brothers and sisters, along the Gulf Coast,"" says Mayor Bill White of Houston, Texas. ""They are welcome, and we are going to provide whatever support we need to."" People from around the United States, along with those in other countries, are also reaching out to Katrina's victims. In Texas, schools opened their doors to students from the devastated communities. In the city of Greenwood, Indiana, fourth-grade teacher Carol Edwards started a drive so her students at Southwest Elementary School could help those affected by Katrina. The class is collecting school supplies and clothing to send to a school that was damaged in the storm. Nine-year-old Alex Warford, a student in Edwards's class, says, ""I think it's a great idea because they lost all their things."" A hurricane forms when warm, moist air rises from the ocean's surface. The air pressure drops, and the winds cause a mass of clouds to form around an eye. The eye is the calm center of the hurricane. The rising air cools and condenses, and heavy rain falls. The eyewall is a solid ring of thunderstorms around the eye. The strongest winds and heaviest rains are located there. By the time Hurricane Katrina moved from the warm waters of the Gulf of Mexico to land, it was a Category 4 storm. (""Rating a Hurricane."") When Katrina slammed into the coasts of Alabama, Mississippi, and Louisiana on August 29, no one was prepared for the destruction that followed. The hurricane packed fierce winds of more than 145 miles an hour by the time it hit land. The monster winds, heavy rains, and flooding destroyed homes, peeled roofs from buildings, and toppled trees. A record-breaking storm surge of nearly 30 feet destroyed communities along the Gulf Coast. A storm surge is a rise of water caused by powerful winds pushing on the ocean's surface. After Katrina passed, 80 percent of New Orleans was flooded when levees that had protected the city collapsed. A levee is a structure that prevents flooding. Thousands of people reportedly died. ""We're dealing with one of the worst natural disasters in our nation's history,"" said President George W. Bush after flying over the devastation. ""The folks on the Gulf Coast are going to need the help of this country for a long time."" Hurricanes are rated on a scale of 1 to 5. A storm's rating is based on wind speed and the potential for destruction."	4
"Nabeel Ahmad remembers being jolted from his sleep. ""I felt my bed shaking, and I felt like I was almost flying,"" he says. At first, he thought the tremors were a dream. But the terrifying tremors weren't a dream—they were a real-life nightmare. A huge earthquake struck the southern Asian countries of Pakistan, India, and Afghanistan on October 8. The earthquake killed at least 79,000 people and flattened dozens of towns. Just days after the earthquake, buried survivors were still being rescued. Relief started pouring in from countries around the world. U.S. helicopters brought supplies and equipment, including hightech cameras to search for buried survivors. The United Nations immediately began working to provide shelter for more than 3 million people who had lost their homes. The earthquake might have been one of the area's worst, but it wasn't the first. Scientists say southern Asia's location makes it likely to be hit again. Earthquakes are sudden movements in Earth's crust, or rocky outer layer. They are caused by the release of pressure inside Earth. The crust is split into giant, slow-moving sections called tectonic plates. An earthquake occurs when those plates collide or pull apart. Southern Asia is split between two tectonic plates—the Indian Plate and the Eurasian Plate. As the Indian Plate moves, it jams into the Eurasian Plate. (See ""Crash Course"" above.) The collision has forced the rock layers on each plate's edge upward, creating the Himalaya mountains. Scientists say the recent earthquake was caused by pent-up pressure at the place where the two plates meet. In many of South Asia's towns, homes and buildings were not constructed to withstand the quake. That is something officials will keep in mind as they work on rebuilding efforts. From Pakistan, Bushra Hassan witnessed the destruction and told Weekly Reader, ""Islamabad [the capital] has never seen such a tragedy."""	4
"World health groups are fighting a war with a crippling and sometimes deadly disease—polio. Their efforts are paying off. Polio has been wiped out in 10 African countries, according to a recent report. Since mid-2003, nearly 200 children in those 10 western and central African countries were paralyzed for life, but no new cases have been reported since last June. When people are paralyzed, they are unable to move different parts of their bodies and may be unable to walk. The disease raced across Africa and into Asia after people in Nigeria refused the polio vaccine, mainly for religious reasons. Vaccines are medications that protect people from getting certain diseases. Officials are hopeful that polio will be eliminated in 2006. ""I think weâ€™ll get there. Things are looking better now,"" Carole Pandak told Weekly Reader. She works for PolioPlus, a group that is part of the global effort to stop the disease. ""In the next six to eight months, all countries might be polio-free except Nigeria."" Polio is a disease that affects the brain and spinal cord. Although polio can strike at any age, it mostly affects children under age 5. The highly contagious disease is passed through person-to-person contact, infecting those who havenâ€™t been vaccinated. The virus enters the body through the mouth and paralyzes one out of every 200 victims. With the help of modern medicine, polio has almost become a distant memory in the United States and other parts of the world. On April 12, 1955, the U.S. government approved the use of a vaccine that stopped people from getting the disease. Jonas Salk was the doctor who invented the first polio vaccine. Although polio has disappeared from much of the world thanks to Salk, it still threatens children in Africa and Asia. Major efforts were recently under way to immunize, or provide children with vaccines. More than 100 million children received vaccinations across 28 African countries, including the 10 where the disease has been eradicated, or wiped out. Nearly all vaccines in those countries are given by mouth. Tireless volunteers and health-care workers organize National Immunization Days. On those days, they set up clinics in markets or go door to door. To spread the word about the vaccinations in rural areas, volunteers hand out whistles, put up balloons, and give out candy. ""We will work from dusk to dawn to make sure that every child under the age of 5 is immunized,"" promised volunteer Bruce Howard from California before he left for Nigeria in November. After children receive their vaccinations, their fingers are marked with ink. ""Itâ€™s uplifting to help so many kids,"" says Pandak. ""The children are hungry, and there are worms in their water. This is one less thing that they have to worry about in their lives."" Groups are making progress to eliminate polio forever. The number of cases worldwide has dropped from 350,000 in 1988 to 1,492, as of November 2005. ""This is the light at the end of the tunnel,"" says Bruce Aylward of the World Health Organization. Think Critically If you could create a new cure for any disease, what would you want to wipe out? Why? From the early 1900s to the mid- 1950s, families in the United States were scared out of their wits. Some parents refused to let their kids go outside, out of fear they would contract polio. In 1938, President Franklin D. Roosevelt, whose legs had been paralyzed by the disease, declared a war on polio. He urged scientists to find a cure. Exactly 10 years after Rooseveltâ€™s death, Salkâ€™s vaccine was declared officially safe. In October 2005—for the first time in 26 years in the United States—five children in a small Amish community in central Minnesota developed polio. None of the children had been immunized against the disease. Health officials say that the general public isnâ€™t at risk. The only people at risk for contracting polio are those who have not been immunized against the disease and who come into direct contact with an infected person."	4
"The waters in the San Francisco Bay, off the California coast, are cold, choppy, and infested with sharks. But that didnâ€™t stop 9-year-old Johnny Wilson from braving the waves. The fourth grader swam the 1.4 miles between Alcatraz Island and San Francisco in just less than two hours. He swam to raise money for Hurricane Katrina victims. Although Johnny trained for three months, the water was colder and wavier than he had expected. Johnny made it to the shore by telling himself, ""Iâ€™m almost there. Iâ€™m almost there."" His classmates were waiting on shore, cheering ""Go, Johnny! Go, Johnny!"" When he came out of the chilly water, his father hugged him and said, ""Can you believe it? You did it!"" Johnny successfully made the trek that Alcatraz prisoners had dared to cross years ago. Alcatraz Island housed a prison from 1934 to 1963. In 1962, three prisoners escaped by swimming across the bay. They were never heard from again, so it remains a mystery whether they made it through the frigid waters to land. Johnny didnâ€™t only raise more than $30,000 for his swim. He also reportedly became the youngest person to swim the distance from Alcatraz to San Francisco."	4
"President George W. Bush awarded retired American boxer Muhammad Ali with this yearâ€™s Presidential Medal of Freedom at the White House. Ali, 63, was among 14 people who received the highest award the government can give a person not in the military. The Medal of Freedom honors people who have made contributions in science, the arts, sports, public service, education, and business. ""All who receive the Medal of Freedom can know that they have a special place in the life of our country and have earned the respect and affection of the American people,"" the president told the group. Many people consider Ali to be one of the best athletes of all time. In 1960, he won an Olympic gold medal in Rome, Italy. Today, Ali suffers from Parkinsonâ€™s disease, a condition that affects the parts of the brain that control the bodyâ€™s movement. With the help of his wife, Ali walked up to the stage to accept his award."	4
"In 1969, Neil Armstrong and Edwin ""Buzz"" Aldrin made history as the first people on the moon. Weekly Reader (WR) spoke to Buzz Aldrin about NASA's planned return to the moon, a future on Mars, and his children's book, Reaching for the Moon, which was recently featured at the National Book Festival in Washington, D.C. Aldrin: You knew that you were there, but it was unreal at the same time. It's so different and unusual that it's almost dreamlike. Aldrin: There are two moments that are not recorded on film. They're recorded in my mind. One was just the second or two after we shut the engine down and we realized that the spacecraft was on the moon. That really was the major achievement. When I was outside seeing the Earth, my other thought was that there were only three human beings who were not on Earth. [The third was Michael Collins, who was orbiting the moon in a craft that would take the astronauts back to Earth.] WR: Your children's book is about following your dreams. Did you dream of being an astronaut? Aldrin: Well, there wasn't any such thing as an astronaut until about 1958 or 1959. Sputnik [the Soviet space satellite] didn't go up until 1957, so thinking of human beings in space was not at all common. Aldrin: No, I don't think there is any way you can replace that competitiveness [to reach the moon first] that existed, that pioneering spirit. The moon is a proving ground in our backyard. We've been there before, but it's preparing us to visit another planet. WR: You've been a supporter of a piloted mission to Mars. Why do you think it's so important that we send humans to Mars? Aldrin: Now we can send robots to Mars, but that just wouldn't satisfy the human desire to want to expand our horizons. We've always done that. I can't answer by saying that there is going to be something profitable that will be returned from Mars, other than perhaps storytelling or making movies en route. WR: Your sister gave you the name ""Buzzer"" when you were young—and then it got shortened to Buzz. And that stuck? Aldrin: It certainly did. It made it very recognizable and unique."	4
"Scientists were conducting a study of fish at Meadow Lake in New York City. To their horror, they found a fish with a long body, a snakelike head, and razor-sharp teeth. They counted another and another, until there were five in all. At that point, they knew they had a problem. Snakehead fish can slither over land from one body of water to another and can breathe air. They dine greedily and can clear a pond of all its fish. They are among the hundreds of invasive species that currently threaten environments in the United States. An invasive species is a plant or an animal that does not belong in the area in which it is living. Many invasive species lack predators in their new environments. Predators are animals that hunt other animals. Although invasive species don't damage their own environments, they can cause massive destruction when they invade another area. Snakehead fish arrived in the United States from China and Korea, most likely as pets. When their owners no longer wanted them, they threw the fish into nearby lakes and streams. Snakehead fish now live in several states, from Maryland to California. Snakehead fish aren't the only accidental arrivals. In the Great Lakes region, fingernail-sized zebra mussels hitchhiked from Russia in the water tanks of ships. Now the mussels clog pipes that provide drinking water to homes and schools. In Michigan, Ohio, and Indiana, young emerald ash borers have killed more than 6 million trees. These beetles likely arrived from China in wood packing material carried in ships or airplanes. And in Hawaii, tiny coqui (koh-KEE) frogs are now a huge problem. The frogs hitched a ride to the ""Aloha State"" in a plant shipment from Puerto Rico. The noisy frogs produce a piercing sound that keeps people awake at night. Scientists in New York are trying to control the snakehead fish population by increasing the salt levels in the lake. Snakeheads can't survive in salty water. Robert Wiese of the Fort Worth Zoo also advises people not to release unwanted pets into the wild, which is especially a problem with tropical fish that are put into rivers and lakes. Invasive species, like snakehead fish, disrupt ecosystems. An ecosystem is a group of plants and animals that live together in the same area. ""Our natural ecosystems are the primary source of our food and drinking water,"" scientist Lisa Gould told Weekly Reader. ""Ecosystems help keep our air clean. They give us medicines. Without them, we could not exist for long."" Coqui frogs have an appetite for Hawaii's insects and are leaving nothing for many endangered birds in the area. To hear these ear-piercing frogs, visit www.weeklyreader.com/invasivespecies. Each year, a female zebra mussel can lay 30,000 to 100,000 eggs. When those eggs hatch, the baby mussels gobble up food and oxygen, leaving nothing for other underwater creatures."	4
"The U.S. Supreme Court has a new chief justice—John Roberts. What effect will this new face have on the changing court? The Supreme Court of the United States is now in session—with a brand-new leader. John G. Roberts Jr. was recently sworn in as the 17th chief justice. The Supreme Court is the highest court in the nation. The Court is made up of nine judges—eight associate justices and one chief justice. Justices are appointed for life. The retirement or death of a justice can create an opening on the Supreme Court. President George W. Bush originally nominated, or chose, Roberts to replace Justice Sandra Day O'Connor. O'Connor, the first woman justice, had announced in July that she would retire. But on September 3, Chief Justice William Rehnquist died. Bush then asked the Senate to consider Roberts for the chief justice position. The chief justice is considered the justice with the most influence on the Court. ""One of the most [important] decisions a president makes is his appointment of a justice to the Supreme Court,"" said Bush in his announcement of Roberts's nomination. ""The decisions of the Supreme Court affect the life of every American."" At press time, the president had nominated Harriet Miers to take over O'Connor's position. If Miers is confirmed, she will be the third woman to serve on the Supreme Court, after O'Connor and Ruth Bader Ginsburg. John Roberts was born in Buffalo, New York, on January 27, 1955. In high school, he was captain of his football team. He also wrestled, sang in the choir, and edited the school newspaper. After graduating from law school, he assisted then Associate Justice Rehnquist. He is married to a lawyer and has two children—Josie, 5, and Jack, 4. The Supreme Court in Washington, D.C., heads the judicial branch, one of three branches of the U.S. government. The other two branches are the legislative branch and the executive branch. Each branch has a different job. The authors of the Constitution created the three branches to ensure that no branch had too much power. That system is called checks and balances. The legislative branch makes laws. That branch is also called Congress and is made up of the Senate and the House of Representatives. The executive branch carries out laws made by Congress. That branch is headed by the president. The judicial branch interprets, or explains, the laws. Many courts across the nation make up the judicial branch. A case makes its way to the Supreme Court through lower courts. The Supreme Court has the power to overturn rulings made in lower courts. Once the Supreme Court rules on a case, the decision is final. All lower courts must follow its decision in similar cases. 1. The president nominates a person to serve as a justice. 2. A group of senators, called the Senate Judiciary Committee, asks the nominee his or her opinions about various laws and cases. 3. The Judiciary Committee votes on the nominee. 4. If the nominee is approved by the Judiciary Committee, all 100 U.S. senators vote. (There are two senators for each state.) 5. A nominee is confirmed if he or she receives 51 votes. Roberts was confirmed by a Senate vote of 78 to 22. Roberts is the youngest chief justice since John Marshall led the Supreme Court more than 200 years ago. At age 50, Roberts is likely to be chief justice for a very long time. The chief justice decides which cases the Court will hear. In many cases, the chief justice speaks first and leads the debate. Do you think Supreme Court justices should be appointed for life? Why or why not?"	4
Nemo's home—the Great Barrier Reef—stretches about 1,250 miles along Australia's northeast coast. It is the world's largest coral reef and home to thousands of plants and animals. Swish! Water in bathtubs in Australia drains counterclockwise because the country is located in the Southern Hemisphere. Australia is home to one of the world's most famous buildings—the Sydney Opera House. Jutting into Sydney's harbor, the Opera House was designed to look like a ship under full sail. The kangaroo is Australia's official animal. There are about 50 million of these creatures hopping around the country. Baby kangaroos are called joeys.	4
"NASA hopes to make a giant leap—back to the moon. The U.S. space agency announced its plan to send four astronauts to the moon within the next 13 to 15 years. ""We will return to the moon no later than 2020 and extend the human presence across the solar system and beyond,"" says Michael Griffin, the head of NASA. The moon is a ball of rock that continually orbits, or circles, Earth. At 226,000 miles away, it is Earth's closest space neighbor. So far, the moon is the only place beyond Earth that humans have actually visited. The astronauts traveled to the moon aboard the Apollo 11 spacecraft. The main mission of the Apollo program was to put Americans on the moon. When Armstrong became the first person to set foot on the moon, he spoke these famous words: ""That's one small step for a man, one giant leap for mankind."" To date, 12 humans have been to the moon. The last crew visited there on the Apollo 17 mission in 1972. NASA plans to develop a new spaceship, by building on technology from the Apollo spacecraft and the space shuttles. ""It's very Apollo-like,"" says Griffin, ""but bigger."" The new spaceship will take the place of the space shuttle. NASA plans to end the space shuttle program within the next five years. The first phase of the plan to return to the moon calls for a launch in 2012. The vehicle would bring crews and supplies to the International Space Station, a research laboratory in space. Later, the vehicle will carry four astronauts to the moon for a weeklong mission. The moon mission is part of President George W. Bush's long-term space plan. Last year, the president promised to return astronauts to the moon—the first step in an eventual mission to Mars. The main goal of the mission is to build a research base on the moon where humans can live and work. The moon is very different from Earth. Unlike Earth, there is no air, wind, or weather. The moon's dusty surface is pitted with craters. While on the moon, astronauts hope to demonstrate that they can ""live off the land."" Learning how to live off the land is important for future human missions to Mars. Because Mars is so far from Earth, traveling there will require humans to stay for long periods of time. The United States has already begun using robots to explore Mars. Two robotic vehicles, Spirit and Opportunity, are on the Red Planet now. They are searching for signs of water, a requirement for life. Another vehicle, called an orbiter, is on its way. The orbiter is set to arrive in March and will circle Mars, studying the planet for signs of water. Although some space experts and lawmakers praise the plan to return to the moon, others oppose it because of the high cost. The project is set to cost $104 billion. Some people think that money should be used for other causes, such as helping to rebuild the Gulf Coast after the hurricanes Katrina and Rita. But NASA is quick to defend the space program. ""[It] is a long-term investment in our future,"" says Griffin. Others say that the public needs to keep being reminded of the ultimate goal. Scientist Louis Friedman says, ""If you don't keep the Mars mission out front, people are going to ask, 'Why are we returning to the moon?' It's got to be because we're extending ourselves into the solar system."" In 1961, President John F. Kennedy promised to land a person on the moon by the end of the 1960s. It was part of the ""Space Race"" with the then Soviet Union. Each country wanted to be the first to send a human to the moon. The time line shows some famous moon milestones and a vision for the future. Should astronauts return to the moon? Why or why not?"	4
"Brothers Kenneth Galeano, 12, and Branden Galeano, 7, were the first students to walk through the doors at Benjamin Franklin Elementary School. They were greeted with welcome signs and big smiles. Ben Franklin is the first public school in New Orleans to reopen since Hurricane Katrina hit four months ago. ""This signals that school is up and running, and thatâ€™s a good thing,"" says Heidi Daniels, a school board member. ""This will help people return to a sense of normalcy."" At least 10 more public schools are expected to reopen in coming weeks."	4

Animal experts say itâ€™s common for mother baboons to give their little ones extra care when cleaning them."	4
"Our classroom play celebrates Philadelphia's hometown hero. Discover how his hard work helped to improve the lives of all Americans. Each morning, Benjamin Franklin asked himself, ""What good shall I do today?"" And that is how he lived his life. His can-do attitude launched him into the history books as one of Americaâ€™s most famous citizens. Ben was a printer, a writer, an inventor, a community leader, and a founder of our nation. Ben was born in a cottage in Boston on January 17, 1706. He attended school only between the ages of 8 and 10. Benâ€™s education was cut short because his family was poor and needed him to work. His love of learning, however, stayed with him throughout his life. Ben read all the time. He often went without food to buy books! At 12, he began his lifelong love of printing. In honor of the 300th anniversary of Benâ€™s birth, our three-act play looks at some key events in the life of this great American. Find out how his good deeds helped shape the history of our country. Narrator 1: Benâ€™s older brother, James, owns a printing press that publishes a very popular newspaper, The New England Courant. James needs a helper, called an apprentice. In 1718, Benâ€™s father decides that 12-year-old Ben should work for James. Narrator 2: At that time, Ben signs a document promising he will work for his brother until he is 21, without pay. In return, his brother is to provide Ben with food and clothes. Narrator 3: Ben likes to read and is a good editor and proofreader. Over the next few years, he learns all about printing—and even begins writing letters to the newspaper under a different name. Thanks to Benâ€™s sense of humor and clever writing in those letters, The New England Courant becomes one of the most-read newspapers in Boston. Narrator 4: James finds out that the letters are from his brother and he becomes jealous of Ben. James is furious and vows never to publish any of Benâ€™s writing again. He also finds fault with Benâ€™s work, even though Ben rarely makes errors. James: Youâ€™ll never find a job in this city! Youâ€™ll come crawling back to me. Narrator 2: But Ben never comes back to his brother. Instead, he leaves in the early morning and runs away to New York City, in hopes of finding work as a printer. After not finding a job there, he heads to New Jersey where he boards a boat to Philadelphia. Narrator 3: The journey is three days long, and Ben is dirty, hungry, and penniless. But Philadelphia is a lively city, and Ben loves it. Narrator 4: After arriving in Philadelphia, Ben works to establish himself as a printer. In 1728, he opens a printing shop and begins publishing his own newspaper, The Pennsylvania Gazette. A few years later, he also publishes Poor Richardâ€™s Almanack. The book includes weather forecasts, recipes, and jokes. It also contains some of Benâ€™s sayings, such as ""Well done is better than well said."" The almanac becomes a best seller and makes Ben wealthy. Narrator 1: Although Ben works to better himself,it is also important to him to help the community. He considers Philadelphia his hometown and works to make life in the city better. Narrator 2: Ben starts projects to pave and sweep Philadelphiaâ€™s streets. He redesigns the cityâ€™s streetlights so that roads are safe at night. Narrator 3: Ben also helps set up the first public library, hospital, and volunteer fire department. At this time, most houses in Philadelphia are made of wood and stand side by side. When a fire breaks out, it can destroy an entire neighborhood. Newspaper boy: Extra! Extra! Fire destroys row houses on Market Street! Narrator 1: Ben is appointed fire chief. He makes sure that firefighters are trained to put out fires and rescue people. Narrator 2: The Union Fire Company meets once a month to discuss fire prevention. Ben also publishes fire prevention tips in his newspaper. Narrator 1: At the time, America is made up of 13 Colonies ruled by Britain. England has passed many laws that the Colonists think are unfair. Narrator 3: Despite his efforts, the Colonies decide to break away from Britain. They fight Britain in the Revolutionary War (1775-1783). Narrator 4: Ben is appointed to the committee to draft the Declaration of Independence. This document frees the Colonies from Britainâ€™s rule. Ben: (to Thomas Jefferson) You must write this very important document. Your writing style is perfect. Ben: (crossing out a few words) Iâ€™ve made small changes. For example, you wrote, sacred and undeniable, and I changed that phrase to make it stronger. Narrator 3: On August 2, Ben and others also sign the document. They know they are risking everything for freedom from Britain. Narrator 4: Seven years later, in 1783, Ben negotiates the treaty that ends the Revolutionary War. In 1787, at age 81, he signs the U.S. Constitution. Narrator 1: Ben Franklin dies on April 17, 1790, at the age of 84. He is buried in Philadelphia. In honor of the 300th anniversary of his birth, people across the country will celebrate the life of this remarkable man. If you could award a medal to Ben Franklin for one of his achievements, which accomplishment would it be? Why?"	4
"Aochan, a rat snake, and Gohan, a dwarf hamster, are an unlikely pair of friends. The two share a cage at a zoo in Tokyo, Japan. Zookeepers placed the hamster, whose name is Japanese for ""meal,"" in the snakeâ€™s cage as a tasty snack. Instead of chowing down on Gohan, the snake befriended the furry rodent. ""Iâ€™ve never seen anything like it,"" says zookeeper Kazuya Yamamoto. ""Gohan sometimes even climbs onto Aochan to take a nap on his back."""	4
"Sumeyya Mamuk, 8, of Van, Turkey, fed and cared for the chickens in her backyard. As they started to get sick and die, she hugged them and kissed them good-bye. The next morning, she had a high fever, and her face and eyes were swollen. Sumeyyaâ€™s father rushed her to the hospital where she was told she had bird flu. Thanks to quick treatment with medicine, Sumeyya recovered. ""Sheâ€™s gotten better,"" says her doctor. Health officials in Turkey and around the world are alarmed by a dangerous disease called avian influenza, or bird flu. The disease mainly affects birds. But the H5N1 strain, or type, can infect people who come in close contact with sick birds. However, experts say eating cooked poultry is safe. Turkey has experienced a recent outbreak as bird flu has raced across Southeast Asia and into Russia and eastern Europe. About 100 million chickens, turkeys, and ducks have died of the disease. Officials have killed millions more in an attempt to stop the spread of bird flu. Sumeyya is among the very few people who have caught the disease. So far, the H5N1 virus has infected about 150 people, killing at least 85 people since 1997. The virus does not usually spread from person to person. Health officials around the globe, however, fear that the virus could mutate, or change, into a form that spreads among people. They are racing to prevent a pandemic, or worldwide outbreak of the disease. Scientists developed a new vaccine, but further studies are still needed. A vaccine is a medicine that protects people against a type of disease. Although there have been no reported cases of bird flu in the United States yet, the government is working to make sure the country is prepared. In November, President Bush announced a $7.1 billion plan to purchase large amounts of vaccines and medicines and develop new treatments. The United States also recently pledged $330 million to help other countries fight bird flu."	4
"Heath Childs gets a new hairstyle resembling the look of an ivory-billed woodpecker. The Arkansas teen is celebrating the rediscovery of the rare bird. Ivory-billed woodpeckers were believed to be extinct in the United States. Scientists recently heard the distinct call of the majestic bird in eastern Arkansas. (""Let's Hear It for the Bird!"")"	4
"New Horizons will capture photos from Pluto. It will also gather information from objects in the Kuiper Belt, the mysterious region on the fringes of our solar system. Very little is known about Pluto, currently the farthest planet from the sun. The tiny planet is one-sixth the size of Earth. It is more than 3 billion miles away, much too far to be seen in detail with a telescope from Earth. Pluto is the only planet that has not been explored by a spacecraft—until now. In late January, NASA, the U.S. space agency, launched the New Horizons spacecraft from Cape Canaveral, Florida. The space probe is now speeding toward Pluto. ""The United States of America has just made history by launching the first spacecraft to explore Pluto,"" mission expert Alan Stern said at launch time. Astronomers, or scientists who study space, hope they will soon have much more information about the planet that lies on the edge of our solar system. New Horizons will fly by Pluto to take photos and study the icy planet. All the information it gathers will be beamed back to Earth. If all goes as expected, New Horizons will reach Pluto in July 2015. The 1,054-pound spacecraft will get as close as 6,200 miles from Plutoâ€™s surface. New Horizons, which is about the size of a grand piano, will also use its powerful cameras to capture images of Plutoâ€™s moon, Charon. The probe will then zoom beyond Pluto and take pictures of the Kuiper (KIGH-per) Belt. The Kuiper Belt is a region that orbits the sun in the far reaches of the solar system. It is filled with thousands of rocky, icy objects. Many scientists believe that objects in the Kuiper Belt are leftovers from the formation of the sun and planets about 4.6 billion years ago. Researchers hope the images will provide clues to how the solar system was created. The nine and a half years it will take New Horizons to reach Pluto will be a long wait for scientists, but they say it will be worth it. ""This is one of the most important regions of the solar system,"" says mission expert Hal Weaver. ""It hasnâ€™t been explored yet, and New Horizons is going to be the first mission to go out there and look at it up close and personal."""	4
"For a moment, 8-year-old Aidan Gold of Bothell, Washington, thought he was stuck. He stood at the edge of a ravine on Mount Hausstock in Switzerland. A ravine is a small, narrow valley with steep sides. The rocks and ice under his feet were unstable. Aidan didnâ€™t think he would be able to cross the huge gap in front of him. ""There seemed to be nowhere to put my foot,"" Aidan told Weekly Reader. He spotted a rock jutting out in the middle of the gap and took a gigantic step. ""I thought that I wouldnâ€™t make it,"" he says. But he did make it across—and all the way to the top of the 10,400-foot mountain. The trek up Mount Hausstock was just one of the high points in the Gold familyâ€™s recent four-month-long climbing adventure. Their trip took them from Switzerland to Kathmandu, Nepal. Aidan and his father, Warren, also reached the summits of MÃ¶nch in the Alps in Europe and Island Peak in the Himalayas in Asia. A summit is the top of a mountain. Aidan is likely the youngest person to reach the top of Island Peak, according to members of the Nepal Mountaineering Association. The Gold family has been climbing mountains since before Aidan could walk. His parents strapped baby Aidan to their backs while climbing peaks all over the world. Since then, Aidan has conquered peaks in the worldâ€™s highest mountain chains. ""Aidan is very driven and has an intense focus,"" Warren Gold told Weekly Reader. ""He just wants to get to the top!"""	4
"Each fall, the skies between eastern Canada and the mountains of central Mexico fill with orange-and-black monarch butterflies. Along their journey, millions of butterflies fight fierce winds and flee predators. Once they reach their destination, monarchs cover trees with their bright, shimmering wings. This year, the monarchs will not be flying alone. Butterfly lovers are accompanying them on their 3,415-mile journey. They are riding in a light aircraft called an ultralight. Their aircraft is painted to resemble the orange, black, and white wings of the monarch. Monarch butterflies migrate, or move from one place to another. Beginning in early August, the butterflies head south for the winter months. Most monarchs travel from Canada to Mexico. Others travel to Florida, California, and Texas. In the spring, the butterflies migrate north. They are the only insects to make such a long round-trip migration. Mexican pilot Francisco Gutierrez and a crew of other pilots from Canada and the United States departed from Quebec, Canada, on August 15. The group plans to arrive in Mexico on November 2. The crew hopes to raise awareness about the monarchs' fragile habitats. Illegal logging in Mexico is thinning the forests that protect the butterflies from rain and cold. No one has ever followed the butterflies in the air for their entire journey. Doing so can teach scientists how the winged insects deal with wind patterns and difficult weather. Gutierrez says, ""It's going to be an adventure."""	4
"Bright-colored toucans and other exotic birds fly among the forest. Emerald tree boas curl up on branches to stalk prey. Endangered jaguars slink through the thick brush in search of food. These are just a few of the thousands of animals that call the Amazon rain forest home. A tropical rain forest is warm and has heavy rainfall. The Amazon, in South America, is the largest rain forest in the world. Yet the Amazonâ€™s future is grim. Farmers are rapidly destroying this lush landscape. Deforestation has been huge problem in the Amazon since the 1960s. Deforestation occurs when farmers and loggers cut down trees to make room for farms, homes, and roads. Until recently, scientists thought the rain forest was losing about 5,800 square miles a year. However, using the latest satellite technology, researchers have discovered that the Amazon is shrinking at about twice that rate. Why should we worry about a rain forest that is thousands of miles from where we live? Deforestation reduces the rain forestâ€™s biodiversity, or the variety of plants and animals in a particular area. The Amazon is one of the richest areas of the world in animal and plant diversity. It is home to the biggest flower in the world, a bird-eating spider, and a monkey about the size of a toothbrush. Scientists estimate that they have identified only a small number of all species that live in the rain forest. As loggers and farmers destroy the forest, animals and plants may become extinct before they are discovered. The Amazon is often called the ""lungs of the world."" Its trees clean the air by taking in carbon dioxide and releasing oxygen. Too much carbon dioxide in the air is harmful to humans. Carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas. Greenhouse gases trap the sunâ€™s heat close to Earth. Without the trees in the rain forest, the Earthâ€™s climate would become much hotter. Stopping the destruction of the rain forest is not an easy task. Brazilâ€™s government recently created two national parks in the Amazon rain forest. The governmentâ€™s efforts placed 3.7 million acres of rain forest off-limits for development. The protected area is more than twice the size of Maryland. Others think that this is not enough. ""The single most important factor contributing to forest loss is population growth in Brazil,"" scientist Jim Bowyer of the University of Michigan told Weekly Reader. ""People make the forest their home. All these people need land for farming and wood for heat and cooking. They are looking for a way to survive."" Scientists estimate that if deforestation continues at its current rate, the rain forest may survive only another 40 to 50 years. ""We need to address the real causes of deforestation, like poverty and population growth,"" says Bowyer. ""Solutions need to involve the very people who destroy the forest."""	4
"Here is a slogan that is easy to remember: ""Use Candles with Care: When You Go Out, Blow Out!"" That's the theme of this year's Fire Prevention Week, which begins October 9. Candles may look beautiful, but they can be a fire hazard. Candle use has increased in popularity. As a result, the number of candle fires in the United States has tripled over the past 10 years."	4
"Some dogs are taking part in a fun pet project— helping kids read! Every Tuesday, a golden retriever named Tucker and an Irish setter named Ross visit students at Washington Grove Elementary. The students at the school in Gaithersburg, Maryland, take turns reading one-on-one with the dogs. Each student spends about 30 minutes sharing a book with a dog and its handler. The visits are part of a nationwide program called Reading Education Assistance Dogs (R.E.A.D.). The program sends dogs and their owners to schools, libraries, and other sites to help kids become better readers. More than 750 dogs in 45 states take part in the program. The read-aloud sessions help kids gain more confidence as they read. Kids know that if they make a mistake, their furry friends are not going to make fun of them. Their canine friends play an active part too, listening closely and using their noses to help turn the pages. One dog even chooses the books by putting its nose on the story it wants to hear! Sometimes dogs end up snoozing, but their reading partners donâ€™t usually mind. Sixth grader Dominick Harper from Kentucky reads to a Labrador retriever named Shyanne. When Shyanne closes her eyes, Dominick says, ""sheâ€™s just taking in the words."""	4
"Sometimes itâ€™s OK to play with your food. People created hundreds of sculptures from food cans and entered them in a yearly competition called Canstruction. The contest is held in dozens of cities across North America to help collect food for people who are impoverished, or poor. For their projects, teams can create anything they want as long as they do it with cans, bottles, and bags of food. Wire, string, and rubber bands are also allowed. Glue is forbidden. Past sculptures that have made it into the winnerâ€™s circle include a hot dog, a castle, and sea creatures, such as an octopus and a shark. The number of cans used to build those structures ranged from 1,000 to 13,000. Elementary school students in Tampa, Florida, recently built spooky sculptures with everything from cans of black beans to boxes of spaghetti. Eleven-yearold Ashley Weaver, who helped construct a haunted house, thought her project looked ""cool."" Canstruction is about more than creativity, though. All the food used to make the sculptures is donated to shelters and food banks. To view the artwork, visitors have to bring canned goods as their admission fee. That food is also donated. Some food banks have helped feed evacuees from Hurricane Katrina. Last yearâ€™s contests raised more than 1 million pounds of canned goods. ""[Canstruction] is an opportunity to bring in much-needed food,"" says Burma Rai, the executive director of an Ohio food bank. Raiâ€™s food bank recently received donations from a Canstruction event held in Dayton, Ohio. The students in Florida understand the importance of helping people who need food. ""Youâ€™re helping someone get a can of food,"" Alexis Carrasco, 10, told reporters as she and her classmates worked on their sculpture. ""This is fun for us and helpful to them."" Although the United States is the richest country in the world, more than 37 million Americans live in poverty. That is more than the population of California, the most populous state. Many of those impoverished Americans are kids. About one in four American children is born poor. What else can be done to fight the poverty problem?"	4
"When thousands of baseball fans head to ballparks this summer, chances are theyâ€™ll have trouble reciting the words to our national anthem. Two out of three Americans donâ€™t know the words to ""The Star-Spangled Banner,"" according to a recent Harris Poll. As a result, the National Anthem Project, spearheaded by music educators, is dedicated to reteaching people the words to Americaâ€™s official song. A crosscountry campaign kicked off in January and is currently touring cities in the West from Los Angeles to Seattle. The tour includes interactive exhibits and a singing contest. In each location, the singer who belts out the best version of the national anthem wins a $1,000 donation to a school music education program of his or her choice. In Richmond, Virginia, an 11-yearold boy took home the top prize. Why donâ€™t people know the words to our countryâ€™s most famous tune? ""We see it as a consequence that music education programs are being diminished in schools,"" project spokesperson Elizabeth Lasko told Weekly Reader. ""[People who do] know the words say they learned them in school."" The nationwide anthem tour will culminate, or end, in Baltimore, Maryland, at Fort McHenry on September 14. That date and that place are when and where Francis Scott Key penned the poem that later became the national anthem. According to the National Anthem Project, the song represents our countryâ€™s history and culture. Many people sing it at community events. ""We want people to know the words so they sing it together,"" says Lasko. ""If youâ€™re taught as a young person to sing it, youâ€™ll always be able to sing it."" For more information on the National Anthem Project and tour cities, visit www.tnap.org. On September 13, 1814, Key watched British ships bomb Fort McHenry in Baltimore, Maryland. The next morning, he spotted the American flag still flying over the fort. The sight inspired him to write the poem. In 1931, Congress made it the national anthem. O say, can you see, by the dawnâ€™s early light, What so proudly we hailed at the twilightâ€™s last gleaming? Whose broad stripes and bright stars, through the perilous fight, Oâ€™er the ramparts we watched, were so gallantly streaming? And the rocketâ€™s red glare, the bombs bursting in air, Gave proof through the night that our flag was still there. O say, does that star-spangled banner yet wave Oâ€™er the land of the free, and the home of the brave?"	4
"Stalagmites rise from the ground. Stalactites resemble icicles and hang from a caveâ€™s ceiling. Inside the dark, damp underground caves of two national parks in central California, scientists made an amazing discovery. They found 27 previously unknown species of spiders, centipedes, millipedes, and scorpion-like creatures. The scientists explored 34 of 238 known caves in Sequoia and Kings Canyon national parks over three years and recently released their findings. The cave dwellers are all invertebrates, or animals without backbones. The discoveries included a tiny pill bug that is translucent, or almost clear. Its internal organs are visible—even its bright-yellow liver! There was also a daddy longlegs with a jaw larger than its body, as well as a little, bright-orange spider. Some creatures were so tiny that scientists had to use the fine hairs of a paintbrush to collect them. ""We thought we might find a handful of new species,"" says Joel Despain, a cave expert for the parks. ""It was amazing to find 27."" Why had the cave creatures gone undetected? Though it is rare to find unknown animal species on Earthâ€™s surface, the same is not true for caves. Like the deep sea, caves are difficult to reach and havenâ€™t been explored as thoroughly as the surface. Discovering so many unknown species was thrilling for Jean Krejca. She is a scientist with Zara Environmental, the Texas-based group that led the project. ""You get the feeling that youâ€™re Lewis and Clark, charting undiscovered territory,"" says Krejca. ""Caves are one of the last frontiers."" This millipede is one of the less strange creatures scientists find in caves. Creatures are often blind and have no pigment. The creatures are unique not only because they are found just in caves but also because some are found in only a single cave or a specific part of a cave. ""There are usually more creatures at the caveâ€™s entrance because there is more food there,"" scientist Rob Myers of Zara Environmental told Weekly Reader. ""The farther back in a cave, the more you find creatures have adapted to cave life. What you find is more and more strange. The creatures are often blind and have no pigment."" Pigment is a substance that gives color. A creature such as the pill bug, for example, doesnâ€™t need pigment in its skin because it doesnâ€™t have to protect itself from the sun. And the daddy longlegs probably developed such big jaws to quickly grab prey, which is scarce inside caves. The next task is to name the new species. Specialists called taxonomists are working to classify and name the creatures. Scientists will also study the new species to determine whether their populations are healthy. Cave animals can teach scientists a lot about the environment because the creatures are sensitive to changes in the ecosystem. An ecosystem is a community of plants and animals that interacts with the environment. If cave creatures decline, it could signal problems or changes in the environment. The recent discoveries have led park officials to plan to protect the caves and the newfound species. ""Now that we know the species are there, we can use them to learn more about cave ecosystems and life on this planet,"" says Myers. What do you call someone who explores and studies caves? A spelunker! ""Caves are absolutely dark,"" Rob Myers of Zara Environmental told Weekly Reader. ""They are darker than your bedroom gets at night. There is zero light in a cave, so you canâ€™t see a hand in front of your face."" When a spelunker heads into a cave, he or she wears a helmet with a headlamp and carries an extra flashlight. The cave explorer also wears elbow pads and kneepads to crawl along the rocky floor. Many caves are underground, so the explorer slides down on ropes connected to special harnesses. While there, a spelunker might see the magnificent cone-shaped formations of stalagmites (stuh-LAGmights) and stalactites (stuh-LAK-tights). They form when water with calcium drips, and the mineral hardens and builds up over time. Stalagmites rise from the ground. Stalactites resemble icicles and hang from a caveâ€™s ceiling. When they meet, they form a column. What is an easy way to remember the difference between the words? Stalactite has a c for ceiling, and stalagmite has a g for ground."	4
"The highest point on Earth just got a little lower. A team of Chinese scientists reports that Mount Everest is now 29,017 feet—about 12 feet less than China's previous measurement. Mount Everest is part of the Himalaya mountain range. The Himalayas stretch through the countries of Pakistan, India, China, Nepal, and Bhutan. Scientists say that Everest hasn't shrunk since it was last measured. The previous measurements were just less accurate. ""When we conducted the survey in 1975, the equipment was much poorer,"" says scientist Chen Bangzhu. Bangzhu and other Chinese researchers climbed to the top of Everest last May because they feared it might be shrinking due to global warming. Global warming is a gradual increase in Earth's temperature. Global warming is causing glaciers on the mountain to melt, say some scientists. Glaciers are huge sheets of slow-moving ice. Although the melting glaciers aren't the cause of Mount Everest's change in height, the rise in Earth's temperature has scientists worried. More than two-thirds of the Himalayan glaciers are already melting. This could spell disaster for countries such as China, India, and Nepal, which depend on rivers fed by melting snow from the glaciers for water. Despite the loss of a few feet, Everest is still the highest point above sea level. Its peak lies on the border between China and Nepal. The mountain was named after Sir George Everest, who mapped much of South Asia between 1830 and 1843."	4
Chewbacca, Han Soloâ€™s furry sidekick in the Star Wars movies, is now a U.S. citizen. Peter Mayhew, the British-born actor who played Chewbacca, was among more than 450 people who took a citizenship oath at a ceremony in Arlington, Texas. People born in the United States are automatically American citizens. People who immigrate, or come from another country, to the United States can become citizens after living here for five years. Like Mayhew, they are called naturalized citizens. To become a naturalized citizen, a person must also take a test that covers U.S. history, English, and government.	4
"The year is 1934. Twelve-year-old Wong Kai Chong must leave everything he knows in China and travel to the United States to join his father. He lands in San Francisco, California, on a cold day and is held on Angel Island, a station for immigrants. An immigrant is a person who comes to a country to live. On Angel Island, officials interrogate, or question, Kai. He knows his answers must match what his father said before him. If they donâ€™t, Kai will be sent back to China. His experience is detailed in the childrenâ€™s book Kaiâ€™s Journey to Gold Mountain. Kaiâ€™s story portrays the voyage of more than 175,000 Chinese immigrants to Angel Island from 1910 to 1940. In December, President George W. Bush signed the Angel Island Immigration Station Restoration and Preservation Act. The law provides up to $15 million to set up a museum and research center on the island to help tell stories like Kaiâ€™s. The money will also be used to protect hundreds of poems carved in the wooden walls of the station that describe the difficult journey. People from China didnâ€™t always have difficulty entering the United States. The earliest Chinese immigrants arrived during the California gold rush in the 1840s and 1850s. They nicknamed the United States Gum Saan, or ""Gold Mountain,"" because many of them hoped to strike it rich. But as the number of Chinese immigrants grew, Americans became less welcoming. In 1882, the U.S. government passed the Chinese Exclusion Act. The law made it almost impossible for Chinese workers to enter the United States. Chinese families were detained, or forcibly held, at Angel Island while immigration officials decided whether the newcomers should be allowed to enter the United States. The process was very different from that of Ellis Island—the New York port of entry for European immigrants. On Ellis Island, more than 95 percent of travelers were processed quickly and allowed into the United States. On Angel Island, many Chinese immigrants were held for weeks, months, and sometimes even years. After being cruelly questioned by officials, more than 30 percent of immigrants were sent back to China. Angel Islandâ€™s doors closed in 1940 when China and the United States became allies, or partners, during World War II (1939-1945). The islandâ€™s main immigration station was scheduled to be destroyed in the 1970s until a park ranger found poetry carved in its walls. The poems described the frustration and sadness that many people felt during their stay at Angel Island. (See ""Angel Islandâ€™s Poets."") Later this year, the poems will literally be brought to light. Angel Islandâ€™s main buildings will reopen to the public, and the poems will be lit up for all to see. ""Angel Island shows a different, but equally important, side of immigration,"" Erika Gee, education expert at the Angel Island Immigration Foundation, told Weekly Reader. ""We hope that Angel Island becomes a bookend to Ellis Island."" More than 200 poems are on the walls of Angel Island. The following two poems were recently translated: Itâ€™s been a long time since I left my home village Who could know Iâ€™d end up imprisoned in a wooden building? Iâ€™m heartsick when I see my reflection, my handkerchief is soaked in tears I ask you, what crime did I commit to deserve this? —Li Hai of Nancun, Taishan What feelings do these poems capture? How do they tell the story of Angel Islandâ€™s immigrants?"	4
Weekly Reader sat down with U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice the day after Iraq announced its draft constitution. Weeks later, Iraqis voted to approve the constitution. Earlier this year, Rice became the first African American woman secretary of state. She is the highest-ranking member of President George W. Bushâ€™s Cabinet, or group of close advisers. As secretary of state, Rice advises the president on foreign affairs and works with world leaders on important issues. WR talked to her about Iraq and her job as head of the State Department. Rice: We were following the Iraqi constitution very closely. It started with a phone call to our ambassador in Baghdad, and then I talked to [President Bush] about what was going on. I probably was on the phone to Baghdad yesterday six or seven times just following what was going on and seeing if there was anything that we could do back here. WR: Some people say itâ€™s a mistake to try to build a democracy in Iraq. How do you respond to critics? Rice: I say shame on anybody who says that people ought to live in tyranny. [That is a type of government ruled by someone unjustly. Rice is referring to Iraqi life under former ruler Saddam Hussein.] When are we going to learn that human beings want to be free? And itâ€™s not as if thereâ€™s a choice in between. You either are free or youâ€™re not. And the people of Iraq are now free. WR: Youâ€™ve traveled more than any other secretary of state in your first six months in office. Did a particular experience stand out for you? Rice: I went to Phuket in Thailand, where the tsunami had taken place. And there were all of these American college students there helping out in the schools. And it reminded me whatâ€™s really great about Americans. Rice: I usually get up about 4:30, and I exercise first. I get into the office about 6:30. I read the newspaper before I leave home, but [my staff] prepares for me reports from around the world. International politics is a 24-hour schedule, because while weâ€™re asleep, the rest of the world is awake. ... My day [may include] meeting with foreign ministers. I go over to the White House for meetings at least three or four times a week. I talk to the president pretty much every day. WR: Youâ€™ve repeatedly said that you donâ€™t want to run for president in 2008. Why donâ€™t you want the nationâ€™s top job? Rice: (laughs) I do have a lot of respect for people who run for office. But I think you have to have a kind of fire to want to do that, and I just—I donâ€™t. Rice: I wanted to be a concert pianist. I could read music from the time I was 3 1/2 years old, and so I studied really hard. I still play [today]. Rice: I did. Even though I was growing up in Birmingham, Alabama, at the time when it was segregated, my parents never let me think that there was anything I couldnâ€™t do. Rice: Well, yes. Now, if the NFL commissionerâ€™s job comes up sometime soon, then the president and I are going to have to talk.	4
"Inside the halls of Congress, more and more lawmakers are speaking Spanish. Congress is the branch of government that makes the laws. Congress is made up of the House of Representatives and the Senate. ""Many politicians are studying Spanish,"" says political expert Michael Shifter. Some lawmakers are taking Spanish classes and debating their positions in Spanish. Others hold bilingual press conferences in English and Spanish. Bilingual refers to being spoken or expressed in two languages. Some lawmakers of Hispanic origin also speak to each other in Spanish. The increased interest in Spanish follows a sharp growth in the Hispanic population in the United States. Hispanics, also known as Latinos, make up the fastest-growing minority group in the country. Hispanic Americans are people in the United States whose families come from Spanish-speaking countries. Most of those countries are located in Central and South America. The latest census, or population count, shows that more than 41 million people in the United States are Hispanic."	4
"With hands on their partners' shoulders, fourth and fifth graders from P.S. 211 in New York City twirled and whirled on the dance floor. After seven months of training, they competed in the ninth annual New York City public school ballroom dancing competition in June. This school year, another group of students has started training. They hope to take home the grand-prize trophy. The competition, called Grand Colors Finals, marks the end-of-the-year celebration of American Ballroom Theater's Dancing Classrooms. The students qualify for the competition in semifinals, similar to spelling bees. The dancing program started in 1994 with one fifth-grade class of 30 students. It has grown to more than 7,000 students in 68 New York City schools. The 2003-2004 season of Dancing Classrooms captured the attention of filmmakers. It was featured in the recent documentary Mad Hot Ballroom. A documentary is a movie based on real life. Some students are hesitant to participate at the beginning of the year but quickly become thrilled by ballroom dancing. ""By the end of the year, the kids want to dance all the time,"" their dance teacher, Heather Berman, told Weekly Reader. Students take lessons during the school day, learning the steps, rhythms, and postures for several dances. They are introduced to the tango, the fox-trot, and a host of other dances. (See ""Shall We Dance?"") P.S. 211 took home the bronze medal in this year's competition. Yet their dance teacher says it's not really about winning. ""Dance gives you life skills,"" says Berman. ""Dance teaches you cooperation, teamwork, respect, and how to be a lady or gentleman."" Ballroom dancing is a style of partner dance. Ballroom dancing has been around since the Middle Ages (from about 500 to 1500). It now includes the waltz and the tango as well as more modern dances, such as disco, the Macarena, and the electric slide. Students in the Dancing Classrooms program master five dances from around the world for the final competition. 1. The fox-trot originated in the summer of 1914 by actor Harry Fox in California. 2. Swing is an American jazz dance from Charleston, North Carolina. 3. The rumba is danced to a blend of Spanish music and African beats. African slaves danced the rumba 400 years ago in Cuba. 4. The merengue was originally a folk dance of the Dominican Republic. 5. The tango originated in Buenos Aires, Argentina. The women wore full skirts and the men wore high boots and spurs."	4
No, it's not a monster from a sci-fi movie, just one of many giant jellyfish invading the Sea of Japan. The enormous creatures, called Nomuraâ€™s jellyfish, each weigh in at about 450 pounds and are 6 feet wide! Scientists arenâ€™t quite sure what caused the jellyfish boom, but the creatures have become a huge problem for the fishing industry in Japan, China, and South Korea. The jellyfish break nets. Their tentacles also poison or crush fish caught in the nets. The three affected countries recently held a conference to discuss ways of dealing with the jellyfish problem. In the meantime, some locals are making the most of the problem and eating the jellyfish!	4
"T. rex wasn't quite the runner that scientists had thought. Learn how high-tech tools are helping scientists piece together what dinosaurs were really like. Scientists once thought that Tyrannosaurus rex was a speedy runner. They believed the huge meat-eating dinosaur, also known as T. rex, could run as fast as 40 miles per hour (about the speed of a car). Thanks to the latest technology, paleontologist Carl Mehling knows that isn't true. A paleontologist studies dinosaurs. With the click of the mouse, a computer shows Mehling that it would be impossible for the giant dinosaur to run that fast because of its size. ""The power of some of these computers is far beyond what scientists could figure out on paper just a few years ago,"" Mehling told Weekly Reader. ""The computers answer questions we wouldn't even have thought of asking."" Now, ""Dinosaurs,"" an exhibit at the American Museum of Natural History in New York City (where Mehling works), explores the modern world of paleontology. In the past, scientists relied only on fossils to learn about dinosaurs. Fossils are the remains of plants and animals from long ago. When a plant or an animal dies, it usually rots away. However, if it is buried quickly by mud or sand, parts of it may be preserved. Over millions of years the remains can turn into a fossil. Fossils can be bones, teeth, footprints, or nests of eggs. When a dinosaur fossil is found, scientists carefully dig around it and study it. They photograph, measure, and record each bone's position. Then the bones are dug up and often taken to a museum where the fossil is rebuilt. Today, advanced technology allows paleontologists to examine fossils in fresh ways. By creating computer models, scientists can tell how bones fit together and how these ancient creatures moved. For example, scientists once thought Apatosaurus used its long neck to munch on tall treetops. Their new model reveals that the huge plant-eating dinosaur most likely bent its neck downward to eat low shrubs and plants. The first T. rex fossil was discovered by Barnum Brown in 1902 in Montana, long after these ancient creatures roamed Earth. Dinosaurs first appeared on Earth 245 million years ago, during the Mesozoic Era. They died about 65 million years ago. What caused dinosaurs to become extinct? Scientists don't know for sure, but they have different theories, or possible explanations. One theory is that a huge asteroid or comet struck Earth. The collision likely filled the air with a huge cloud of dust and blocked out most of the sun's light and heat. As a result, many plants and animals would have died out. In addition to using computers to study dinosaurs, scientists also use special X-ray machines to look inside fossils. They hope that new technology may one day answer ancient mysteries like what color dinosaurs might have been. ""Every time a new technique comes up, the old fossils are pulled out again and looked at anew with brand-new eyes,"" Mehling says. ""It's cool."" Tyrannosaurus Rex Scientists once thought T. rex stood upright and dragged its tail along the ground. They now think it leaned forward, sticking its tail out for balance. Stegosaurus Researchers now think the plates on the back of this dinosaur were brightly colored. Stegosaurs might have used the plates to communicate with other dinosaurs. Deinonychus Fossil remains of this dinosaur have been found near one another. Scientists suspect the dinosaurs hunted in packs."	4
"Mount Rushmore is getting a cleaning for the first time in its 65-year history. Carved into the famous granite monument are the faces of four U.S. presidents—George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, Theodore Roosevelt, and Abraham Lincoln. Mount Rushmore is located in the Black Hills of South Dakota. For five weeks this summer, a crew washed the presidents' faces. To kick off the cleaning, workers scaled the mountain and sprayed the left side of Jefferson's forehead with water. They also blasted Jefferson's eyelid and jaw with handheld hoses to wash away decades of dirt. ""Apart from the dirt, we are concerned with the lichens,"" Mount Rushmore official Judy Olson told Weekly Reader. Lichens are small plant-like organisms that can grow on hard surfaces, such as rock and bark. They make an acid that can harm the faces. ""The lichen roots are digging into the stone,"" Olson says. The workers took special care near the cracks on the stone faces. They used pressure washing instead of chemicals. Pressure washing has been used to clean other historical structures, including the Statue of Liberty in New York City and the Coliseum in Rome. Mount Rushmore was designed by American sculptor Gutzon Borglum. From 1927 to 1941, his team worked on the memorial. They used drills and dynamite to blast into the cliff. Each head is as tall as a six-story building."	4
"Suspected that color was very important to Australia's honey possums. The tiny possums would always scurry to the brightest orange flowers to dine on their nectar. That is the sweet liquid that flowers produce. Until recently, most scientists thought the tree-dwelling possums had poor color vision because they are nocturnal animals. A nocturnal animal sleeps during the day and is active at night. ""I noticed that possums were very active during the day, which I had not expected,"" Arrese told Weekly Reader. ""I also noticed that the possums never made a mistake when searching out the sweet nectar from certain brightly colored flowers."" To test her idea, Arrese did experiments with honey possums, tiny mouselike creatures called dunnarts, and other marsupials. What she discovered amazed scientists. Marsupials can see in color, just like humans. Marsupial is the name given to the group of mammals that includes possums, koalas, kangaroos, and Tasmanian devils. A mammal is a warm-blooded animal that feeds its young with milk. Marsupials are different from other mammals because females have a pouch in which to carry their young. There are about 250 species, or types, of marsupials. Most live in Australia and its nearby islands. How exactly do these marsupials see? Color vision depends on cones. Cones are tiny cells in the retina that react to light. The retina is the lining in the back of the eye. It connects to the brain. Marsupials have three types of cones in their eyes. Most mammals, including dogs and horses, have only two types of cone cells. That leaves them unable to see blues or reds. Primates, such as humans and apes, also have two types of cones. However, one cone is a special type that allows them to see a wide range of colors. (Check out ""How Do We See?"" to learn how the human eye works.) Thanks to light, you can see. Light reflects, or bounces, off objects and travels to your eyes. Light enters the eye through the pupil. The pupil is the black circle in the middle of the eye. After entering the pupil, light passes through the lens. The lens focuses light on light-sensitive cells in the retina, forming an upside-down image. The retina has two types of light-sensitive cells. Rods detect black and white. Cones detect color. The retina turns the light image into electrical signals. Those signals travel to the brain through the optic nerve. The brain then turns the image right side up. Arrese's findings show that some marsupials, like the possum and the dunnart, can see even ultraviolet light. That means they have stronger vision than humans! Ultraviolet light comes from the sun and is invisible to the human eye. It is the kind of light that causes tans and sunburns. Thanks to Arrese's most recent discovery, scientists hope to learn more about mammals' eyesight. ""Before my findings, scientists were firmly convinced that among mammals, only primates, including humans, could see a full range of colors,"" she says. In addition, her research has put the spotlight on the pouch-bearing creatures. Scientists will use the latest research to learn more about marsupials. ""For a long time, marsupials were considered not as interesting as other mammals,"" says Arrese. ""Now all that has changed."" Sight is one of the five senses. Which of the senses do you think would be the hardest to survive without?"	4
This year, Ramadan began on October 4 and will end on November 2. Ramadan is celebrated by Muslims, who follow the religion of Islam. During Ramadan, Muslims fast, or do not eat or drink, from sunrise to sunset. At night, families feast on different types of food. In the evening, Muslims go to mosques, or special places of worship. The mosque below is located in the United Arab Emirates, a country in the Middle East. These five countries have the largest Muslim populations. Can you find them on a map?	4
"South America's frog populations are on the decline. That spells trouble for the environment. Ecuador is home to hundreds of types of frogs and toads. But now scientists are worrying about their health. The mountains and thick forests of Ecuador, in South America, are home to 417 types of frogs and toads. Tiny red-eyed tree frogs hide inside flowers. Bumpy-skinned toads use their sticky tongues to catch mosquitoes and other prey. Colorful poison dart frogs rest on tree branches. These brightly colored frogs are packed with poison, which protects them from their enemies. Now, many species, or types, of frogs and toads in Ecuador are at risk of dying out. According to a recent report by the group NatureServe, eight frogs have become extinct, or died out, in North and South America in the last 100 years. ""It's the same magnitude event as the extinction of the dinosaurs,"" says scientist Luis Coloma. Salamanders, frogs, and toads are all amphibians. Amphibians are animals with backbones that spend part of their life in water and part on land. Frogs and toads lay jellylike eggs in water. The eggs hatch into tadpoles, which breathe through gills. As the tadpoles grow into frogs or toads, they develop lungs and live on land. Like reptiles, such as lizards and snakes, amphibians are cold-blooded. That means their body temperature depends on the environment. Unlike reptiles, amphibians lack protective scales. Amphibians must live near water so that their skin stays moist. Over the last 50 years, many amphibian species have become extinct. Two of every five of the 3,046 species that live in North and South America are at risk of vanishing. Why are these creatures in trouble? Their habitat is being destroyed as loggers cut down trees to make room for farms and roads. A habitat is a place in nature where a plant or an animal makes its home. Disease, weather changes, and pollution are other causes of the decline in amphibian populations. Scientists are concerned about the decrease in the number of frogs. The health of frogs is closely linked to the health of the environment. ""Amphibian extinction is an indicator of [a problem with the environment],"" scientist Jonathan Campbell told Weekly Reader. Because amphibians breathe through their skin, they easily absorb pollution. They are usually the first to disappear when the environment is under threat. As a result, some frogs are born with deformed, or wrongly shaped, body parts, such as extra legs and eyes. When frogs with strange body parts are found in an area, it is a clue that the environment is polluted or suffering. Scientists are fighting to save amphibians. Some scientists believe that South America's poison dart frogs have chemicals in their body that can be used to treat diseases, such as cancer. The scientists want governments to pass laws that will reduce pollution and to create parks that protect the amphibians' habitat. ""Almost half of the extinctions are happening for unknown reasons,"" scientist Robert Kaplan told Weekly Reader. ""Scientists have a lot of work to do, and quickly."""	4
"Scientists have reported the discovery of a terrifying ancient sea creature. The 13-foot-long monster appears to be part crocodile and part T. rex. The creature likely roamed the Pacific Ocean about 135 million years ago, during the Age of the Dinosaurs. Scientists nicknamed the crocodile ""Godzilla,"" after the film monster. Based on the fossil of the skull, scientists created a computer image of Godzilla. Fossils are ancient remains of plants and animal preserved in rock. The crocâ€™s fossil was discovered in 1996 in Argentina, a country in South America. After studying the fossil for 10 years, scientists recently published their research. Unlike other ocean crocs of the time, Godzilla had a short, high snout and a mouthful of large, jagged teeth for devouring other animals. Other crocodiles had long, thin snouts and smaller teeth. Scientists say Godzilla was a top ocean predator—an animal that feeds on other animals. It most likely dined on other large creatures rather than small fish. ""We are calling him the chico malo—â€˜bad boyâ€™ of the ocean,"" says one of the researchers."	4
"Cree Hayuga is at an age when most kids like to spend their free time playing video games or hanging out with their friends. Instead, this fifth grader from Santa Fe, New Mexico, spends three hours each Wednesday afternoon training dogs. Cree is a volunteer at Assistance Dogs of the West. That is one of several programs around the country that train dogs to be the eyes, ears, and hands for some people with disabilities. Cree started volunteering when she was in fourth grade because she loves animals. Dogs in the program learn how to open and shut doors, turn lights on and off, throw away trash, and pick up items for people who are in wheelchairs. Each dog learns a total of 90 commands. ""The hardest command to teach a dog is the stand-stay position,"" Cree told Weekly Reader. In that position, the dog stands at its owner's side when it is not doing anything else. Cree says that training dogs has taught her patience and responsibility. ""It's really fun,"" she told Weekly Reader. ""The animals get really attached to you, and it's hard to say good-bye."" Although saying good-bye isn't easy, Cree knows that she has helped both the dog and its grateful owner. When she grows up, Cree plans to be an animal doctor called a veterinarian."	4
"The Olympic motto is ""swifter, higher, stronger."" Meet some Olympic hopefuls who hope to live up to the meaning. Figure Skater Michelle Kwan, 25, became interested in figure skating when she was 5, after watching her older brother play hockey. She has won five World Figure Skating titles and is no stranger to the Olympics. She took home a silver medal in 1998 and a bronze medal in 2002. Kwan wears a Chinese good-luck charm around her neck during competitions. It was given to her by her grandmother. Skeleton Sledder Noelle Pikus-Pace, 23, from Orem, Utah, is all about Olympic spirit. In 2005, she was skeleton sleddingâ€™s World Cup champion. However, disaster struck in October 2005 after her team finished a practice run in Canada. A bobsled crashed into Pikus-Pace, breaking her leg. Just two months later, Pikus-Pace was back on her sled and hoping to lead her team to victory. Snowboarder Shaun Whiteâ€™s fans know him as the ""Flying Tomato."" The 19-year-old from Carlsbad, California, is almost as famous for his long red hair as he is for his snowboarding moves. White started snowboarding at age 6 and turned pro at just 13. He is the first athlete to compete in both the Winter and the Summer X Games in two different sports— snowboarding and skateboarding."	4
"Americans spend more than they earn. Why should you save? Joseph Britton, 9, of Danbury, Connecticut, earns an allowance. He gets paid for doing chores—taking out the trash, making his bed, and washing the dishes. His classmate, Catherine VanWattum, 9, also gets money for helping out around the house. The two fourth graders are saving enough money to buy Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, the sixth title in the popular book series. Joseph and Catherine may be managing their money better than most adults. The amount of money that Americans save is at its lowest since the Great Depression of the 1930s, when many people did not have jobs. What is causing this shrink in savings? ""It seems that weâ€™ve lost the culture and habit of savings,"" says financial expert Nancy Register. ""Thereâ€™s so much ... pressure to spend and buy. ... And if you canâ€™t buy it now, [you can] put it on your credit card."" A credit card purchase is a loan that needs to be paid back. Credit card companies charge money if the loan isnâ€™t paid back on time. Americans owe more than $800 billion in credit card debt, according to the Center for Responsible Lending. Although many adults are racking up credit card debt, some children are savvier about their savings. ""I deposit some of my savings, like birthday checks from my grandparents, into my college fund,"" Joseph told Weekly Reader. He often joins his mother on her trips to the bank. Banks offer people several ways of saving their money. Two popular options include savings accounts and savings bonds. In a savings account, a person deposits money in the bank. In turn, the bank pays the person interest, or a percentage of the savings. (See ""Whatâ€™s My Interest?"" to learn how interest works.) Savings bonds are certificates that show a person has agreed to lend money to the U.S. government. The government uses the money to help pay its bills. Bonds also pay interest each year. Experts stress that itâ€™s never too early to learn how to make sense of your money. ""You canâ€™t wait until you are a grown-up to learn about personal finance,"" financial expert Robert Duvall told Weekly Reader. Experts point out that saving money is about making good decisions and setting goals. ""If you spend all your money on an iPod, you have to consider what you will not be able to have,"" adds Duvall. Duvall also encourages kids to look to the future— and pick up tips on how to invest. When a person invests money, he or she buys something, such as a house or a stock, with the hope that it will become more valuable over time. When a person owns stock in a company, he or she invests money in it and owns part of the company. Money expert Laura Levine also emphasizes the importance of making smart money decisions. ""Saving money is about establishing a good habit, like flossing your teeth,"" she told Weekly Reader. ""If you donâ€™t develop the habit as a young person, it is hard to change as an adult."" So how does interest work? Say you deposit $100 in a savings account. If the bankâ€™s interest rate is 2 percent per year, the bank will pay you an additional $2 after one year. (2 percent can also be expressed as a decimal: .02) To calculate 2 percent of $100, multiply $100 by .02. Therefore, 2% of $100 = $2. credit card — a plastic card used to pay for products and services. The credit card company sends a bill for all purchases made that month. interest — money paid for the use of money. A person who takes out a loan from a bank pays interest on the loan; a bank pays interest on money that is deposited in the bank."	4
"Terrified of heights? Then you might not want to step out on a glass-bottomed walkway that will jut out from the edge of the Grand Canyon. Beginning this January, thrill seekers will be able to walk along a 70-foot horse-shoe-shaped walkway and look down to see the Colorado River gushing and flowing 4,000 feet below. ""It's a whole new way to experience the Grand Canyon,"" says spokesperson Sheri Yellowhawk. The skywalk area will also feature a Native American village and a Western-themed town. The walkway will have a glass bottom and sides and will be supported by steel beams. The skywalk will be able to hold 120 people comfortably. However, Yellowhawk says it is designed to hold up to 72 million pounds! The Grand Canyon, in northern Arizona, is a massive gorge, or narrow passage. The canyon was carved by the Colorado River as it cut a channel through rock over millions of years. The gorge stretches more than 270 miles. Park officials hope that the new walkway will encourage more tourists to come visit the amazing natural landmark."	4
"U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service The bears are back after being on the brink of extinction in and around Yellowstone National Park. Yellowstone is located in the states of Wyoming, Idaho, and Montana. Now the U.S. government may remove the grizzly from its list of endangered species in this area. ""The future of the Yellowstone grizzly bears is bright,"" says Chris Servheen of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. That wasnâ€™t always the case. The numbers of grizzlies began to shrink in the early 1900s largely because ranchers hunted the animals and farmers destroyed their habitats, or homes. By 1975, only 220 to 320 bears still lived in the Yellowstone area. That year, the grizzly was listed as a threatened species under the Endangered Species Act, which offers special protection to animals facing extinction. Today, wildlife experts estimate that more than 600 bears live in the region surrounding Yellowstone. Grizzly bears live in other parts of Idaho, Montana, and Wyoming as well as Washington state and will remain on the list in those areas. Grizzlies in Alaska, which number about 30,000, have never been on the list because that population is healthy. Itâ€™s Not Time Yet Not everyone thinks itâ€™s a good decision to remove grizzlies from the list. Some wildlife officials fear that if the bear is removed from the list, its habitat around Yellowstone could be used for logging, oil drilling, and development. Others worry that the bears will be hunted again. ""We would love to see the grizzly bear delisted, but itâ€™s not ready,"" says wildlife supporter Louisa Wilcox. ""If you want to protect bears for future generations, you have to protect the habitat they need. This plan doesnâ€™t do it."" Should grizzlies no longer be listed as an endangered species? Why or why not? The grizzlyâ€™s return isnâ€™t the only species success story. Take a look at some other animals that are being saved, thanks to tough laws and hardworking scientists. In 1963, only 417 pairs of bald eagles nested in the United States. There are now more than 6,400 pairs, and the national symbol may soon be removed from the list of endangered species. Hawaiians used to hunt this reptile for dinner. Now they swim alongside the turtles near some islands. The number of nesting females has jumped to more than 400 a year. There were only 67 in 1973. Pollution and habitat loss have made it hard for sea otters to stay afloat. In 1938, there were only several hundred otters off the coast of California. Today, there are more than 2,500."	4
"Whoosh! Within seconds, a spark sets off large flames. The flames of a wildfire tear through a forest, destroying thousands of acres of trees and brush and threatening the homes of people and animals. From California to Colorado and from Alaska to Arizona, firefighters have been battling thousands of wildfires this year. Wildfire season began in June and will last through November. So far, the flames have destroyed more than 3 million acres in the United States—an area about the size of New Jersey! Most wildfires are started naturally, either by lightning or from the sun's heat. Others are accidentally started by careless humans who leave campfires burning. Hot, dry weather has caused most of this season's wildfires to spread. ""This year is unique,"" Rose Davis, an official at the U.S. National Interagency Fire Center, told Weekly Reader. Davis explained that the Northwest is suffering a drought. A drought is a long period of dry weather with little rain. In the Southwest, heavy rains in the spring caused a lot of new grass to grow. The new grass burns quickly when it dries out. Firefighters have been fighting the scorching flames from the ground and the air. Specially trained firefighters called smoke jumpers parachute from planes or helicopters to reach remote fires. Because smoke jumpers leap into out-of-the-way areas, they carry enough food and water with them to survive for several days. Although wildfires can be very dangerous, they are not all bad. In areas where few people live, officials monitor the wildfires. Sometimes, officials allow them to burn because the fires help the environment and keep forests healthy. ""If fires are going to spread to people's homes and property, we have to put them out,"" smoke jumper Lori Messenger told Weekly Reader. Wildfires are like nature's housekeeper—and forests come back to life after fires. ""Fire is a natural part of our forests,"" says Messenger. ""The fires kill the less healthy, diseased trees. They clean out the brush to make space for animals to graze on the new grass that grows."" Some plants also need heat from a fire to help them release their seeds, which grow into new plants after a fire. Fire is nature's way of recycling dead plants into the soil. The dead plants help return nutrients to the soil. Although some animals die, many creatures have ways of protecting themselves. Large animals, such as deer, moose, and buffalo, head to safety. Small animals, such as snakes, toads, and mice, burrow in the ground. ""It's important to realize that fires are an important part of what happens in a forest,"" says Messenger. ""It's a complicated balance, and people who manage the forest have to make good decisions about what fires will be fought and what fires will be left to burn."" A fire requires three ingredients to burn—heat, fuel, and oxygen. The combination of those three building blocks is referred to as the fire triangle. Heat is responsible for starting the fire. Heat can come from a lit match or a bolt of lightning, for example. Fuel is anything that will burn. In a wildfire, fuel can be logs, grass, or even paper and trash. Oxygen is a gas and must be in the air for a fire to start. Burning fuel reacts with oxygen in the air to release heat, gases, and smoke."	4
"Katie Brownell is in a league of her own. The 11-year-old is the only girl in her upstate New York Little League. In May, she also became the first and only girl ever to pitch a perfect Little League game. In July, the Baseball Hall of Fame put Katie's jersey on display. Her shirt now hangs in the same building that houses items that once belonged to baseball legends ""Babe"" Ruth, Joe DiMaggio, and Hank Aaron. Katie won the game in a style that would make Pedro Martinez, the ace pitcher for the New York Mets, proud. She struck out all 18 batters she faced in the game in Oakfield, New York! Katie has been playing baseball since she was 6. She first took the mound three years ago. Since her history-making win, she has found herself in the spotlight of the national media. Katie has even met President George W. Bush and received a congratulatory note and a pink baseball cap from the Los Angeles Dodgers. What is Katie's advice to other young athletes? ""Just believe in your dreams, and go out and have fun."""	4
"Life hasnâ€™t been sweet for honeybees lately. Varroa mites, which have come to the United States from Asia, have destroyed honeybee populations during the last few years. Mites are tiny, eightlegged creatures that live off plants, animals, or food. ""The mites are decimating the hives,"" Kevin Hackett of the U.S. Department of Agricultureâ€™s research program for bees told Weekly Reader. He said beekeepers in the United States have lost about 500,000 of their 2.5 million hives because of mites. Why are honeybees so important? Farmers depend on honeybees to pollinate their crops. During pollination, bees transfer pollen, the yellow powder inside flowers, from one flower to another. Experts estimate that nearly one-third of the food that humans eat—from apples to zucchini—is pollinated by bees. ""Crops that are pollinated are the tasty things that people like to eat, such as fruits, vegetables, and nuts,"" says Hackett. Farmers are feeling the effects as mites destroy the colony, or large group of bees, inside the hive. Beekeepers who manage hives rent honeybees to farmers to pollinate their crops. The bee shortage has driven up prices, making it expensive for farmers to rent honeybees. Each year, bees typically pollinate crops worth about $15 billion. Crop loss due to the bee shortage is costing farmers billions. Farmers in California are particularly hurting because about 80 percent of the worldâ€™s almonds are grown there. Almond tree blossoms need honeybees to pollinate them. To help protect honeybees and to tackle the mite problem, government agencies and the National Honey Board are conducting research. They are also trying to encourage more people to go into apiculture, or beekeeping."	4
"Hawaii has reason to celebrate! The state welcomed its baseball champs home after they won the Little League World Series in late August. That victory marked the first time a team from Hawaii has won a Little League world championship. Hawaii's West Oahu of Ewa Beach team defeated a team from CuraÃ§ao, a country in the Caribbean, 7â€“6. It was not an easy win. CuraÃ§ao was the defending champ. The game went into extra innings. Hawaii came back from three runs down to tie the game. It was the first time a championship had gone into extra innings since 1971. The championship game was played in South Williamsport, Pennsylvania, before more than 25,000 fans. (Little League Baseball began in Pennsylvania in 1939.) Michael Memea, 12, of Hawaii cracked the game-winning home run. ""I knew it was gone,"" he later said proudly. After his home run, Memea rounded the bases and high-fived his teammates, who were waiting for him at home plate. Then the team took a victory jog around the stadium while fans cheered wildly. After the win, Hawaii's team manager Layton Aliviado said, ""Our dream came true!"""	4
"Thanksgiving Day is right around the corner. But before you dig in to enjoy that special family meal, health experts remind you to eat safely. Eating food too quickly is a major cause of choking. A person who is choking can't speak or breathe. The Heimlich (HIGHM-lik) maneuver is a special move that can help save the life of someone who is choking. Each year, Weekly Reader hears from kids who help save lives after learning about the Heimlich maneuver in their student issues. Fourth grader Eric Wilson from Nevada was one of those kids. He put what he had learned to good use—and saved the day. Earlier this year, he performed the Heimlich maneuver on first grader Bryce Bloomfield, who was choking on a piece of candy. ""His face started to turn red,"" Eric told Weekly Reader. Eric had to perform the Heimlich maneuver a few times before he saw the candy come out of Bryce's mouth. Eric says, ""I felt glad because I saved another kid's life."" 1. Stand behind the choking person and wrap your arm around his or her waist. 2. Make a fist and hold it against the person's stomach, about halfway between the belly button and the rib cage. 3. Grab your fist with your other hand. Press it in with an upward thrust. Repeat until the person stops choking."	4
"Scientists are using the latest technology to solve a 4,500-year-old mystery. They want to discover where two narrow passageways inside the Great Pyramid lead. This winter, scientists are sending a small robot into the Great Pyramid for a second time. In 2002, they sent the robot through the pyramidâ€™s tight passageways. After crawling through the corridors and drilling through a thick stone door, the robot revealed nothing but another closed door! This time, scientists hope to solve the puzzle of what lies behind door number two. The Great Pyramid of Giza is the largest pyramid in Egypt. Giza is located on the Nile River, near the capital of Cairo. The Great Pyramid is one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World. Those structures were built between 4,500 and 2,200 years ago. Of the ancient wonders, only the Great Pyramid remains today. The ancient pyramids were built as burial places for pharaohs, or kings, of Egypt. It took workers 20 years to construct those monuments. Some scientists believe that the Great Pyramid was the burial place for Egyptâ€™s pharaoh Khufu. No one knows what happened to Khufu or whether he was buried with his treasures. Some scientists believe that the two tight shafts might lead to his undiscovered tomb. ""People all over the world are waiting to solve [the mystery of the pyramid],"" Egypt expert Zahi Hawaas told reporters. Perched atop a hill in Germany, the castle above is one of 200 worldwide choices for the New Seven Wonders of the World vote. The castle is called Neuschwanstein (NOY-shvan-stine) and was built in the late 1800s as a royal palace. Does it look familiar? Cinderellaâ€™s castle at Disneyland is modeled after it. The winner of the global vote will be announced on January 1, 2007. To learn more about the vote and the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World, visit www.weeklyreader.com."	4
"Thousands of students put their art skills to the test. They entered the annual greeting card contest sponsored by UNICEF, Pier 1, and Weekly Reader. Six-year-old Adam Carr from Florida and 12-year-old Anna Hall from Colorado took top honors. The two grand-prize winners won a trip to New York City, where they will tour the United Nations. Adamâ€™s and Annaâ€™s drawings will be made into greeting cards. Money from profits will be donated to help children in need overseas. Adam drew a cheerful snowman with a boy hugging its tummy. Annaâ€™s design features the word PEACE, with people from around the world. What message did Anna have for kids? ""Look at the similarities in people, not the differences,"" she told Weekly Reader."	4
"Forget about traveling to Africa to go on a safari. If some scientists have their way, people may be able to spot lions, cheetahs, and elephants roaming the Great Plains of North America. The Great Plains lies in the center of North America. The region extends from the Mississippi River to the Rocky Mountains and from Canada to Texas. A team of scientists wants to introduce African animals such as lions, elephants, and cheetahs to the United States. The goal of their bold plan is to help save endangered animals from extinction in Africa. Many animal habitats there are disappearing. A habitat is the place where a plant or an animal lives. The African animals they want to relocate to the Great Plains are the closest living relatives of animals that lived in the United States long ago. Some of those ancient animals include saber-toothed cats and mastodons. A mastodon was an elephant-like creature with long tusks. Those animals lived until the last ice age ended, about 10,000 years ago. An ice age is a period of time when large sheets of ice covered Earth. People who oppose the plan argue that releasing species into new environments could cause destruction. Cattle and sheep ranchers are also concerned that the wild animals will devour their herds. Many scientists say that relocating African animals is a bad idea because there are already many species that need protection in North America. Scientist Donald Grayson adds, ""Why introduce â€¦ [elephants] and lions when there are North American species that could benefit from the same kind of effort?"""	4
"The Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King addresses a group of followers. For many Americans, January 16 isnâ€™t just a ""day off "" from school or work. They will make it a ""day on"" and participate in community service projects in honor of Martin Luther King Jr. Day. This year marks the 20th anniversary of the holiday. King (1929-1968) was a famous civil rights leader. When King was growing up, the South was segregated, or separated by race. Black people did not have the same rights as white people. Under the law, they were not allowed to attend the same schools as white people and had to sit in the backseats of buses. Black people also had to use separate restrooms and drinking fountains. When King was older, he worked to change those unjust laws. During the 1950s and 1960s, he gave speeches and organized peaceful marches and protests. Beginning in 1955, King led the famous Montgomery bus boycott. For 381 days, African Americans boycotted, or refused to use, public buses in the Alabama city. A year later, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that segregated buses were illegal. King gained national attention from the boycott and, in 1963, delivered his famous ""I Have a Dream"" speech. He told a crowd of more than 200,000 people in Washington, D.C., that his dream was for all people to be treated fairly and equally under the law. As a result of his work, civil rights laws were passed. Those laws protect the rights of all Americans. Many people will celebrate Kingâ€™s legacy on January 16 with parades and other events. The legacy of a leader is something left behind for future generations. For King, that meant making the world a better place. Thousands more will honor King by cleaning parks, volunteering at homeless shelters, and participating in other community service projects. ""Everybody can be great because everybody can serve,"" King once said. By taking part in community service projects, Americans are able to keep this leaderâ€™s dream alive."	4
"Fourth graders at McCormick Elementary School in Chicago, Illinois, have been learning Chinese since kindergarten.Visitors to their classroom maybe be greeted with ""ni hao"" (pronounced NEE HOW). The fourth graders are studying Mandarin—the main language in China. The students at McCormick are not alone. In classrooms from Los Angeles to New York City, students are learning Chinese. Schools want to prepare students for jobs in which they are likely to do business with China. Business in China is booming, and that trend is expected to grow over the next 20 years. The chart shows how Chinese stacks up against other languages spoken by many people."	4
"In a small village in Niger, mothers line up at feeding centers with their hungry children in hopes of receiving food and medical care. The people in this western African country are suffering from a hunger crisis after a severe food shortage. Niger is the second-poorest country in the world. The United Nations estimates that 2.5 million of Niger's 12 million people live on less than one meal per day. The recent food shortage has put millions of people at risk of starvation. Most of the hungry are children. ""The situation of children in Niger is critical, and we are in a race against time to save their lives,"" says one United Nations Children's Fund official. Life is difficult in landlocked Niger where food is rarely plentiful. A landlocked country is surrounded by land. Most of the country's people live in the southern part of the country, below the Sahara desert. There is usually a rainy season in this area between May and October. People plant crops, which grow during the rainy season. But last year, the rains never came. A severe drought destroyed most of the country's crops. A drought is a long period with little or no rain. Swarms of insects called locusts, also invaded the country and ate the crops that had survived the drought. Now Niger is facing its biggest food shortage in 20 years. Many aid groups say the hunger disaster could have been avoided if the outside world had responded earlier. The United Nations World Food Programme began sounding the alarms about a potential hunger crisis last year. That group helps feed millions of people living in poverty around the world. People who live in poverty don't have enough money for food, health care, or school for kids and often lack clean drinking water. Niger's government also asked richer nations for food aid and money for farmers most in need. Earlier this year, the country received only a fraction of the aid it needed. ""Niger is a forgotten country,"" says one African official. But now people around the world have started responding to the cry for help. During the past few months, media reports about the food crisis have attracted attention to Niger. Aid is now pouring in from countries around the world. Government agencies and rescue workers are sending planeloads of food and medical help. Medical workers are treating thousands of malnourished children. When children are malnourished, they have not gotten enough nutrients from food to grow and be healthy. There is some hope though. An early start to this year's rainy season in Niger has helped crops begin to grow. However, as one person from Niger put it, ""Even if the rains are good this year, the harvest will not be enough."" Languages: The official language of Niger is French. Niger was a French colony until it gained independence in 1960. People also speak the African languages Hausa and Djerma."	4
"The biggest cities in the Asian nation of India are not much different from New York City or San Francisco. Towering buildings scrape the sky. Cars, trucks, and buses clog the busy roads. McDonaldâ€™s restaurants and Barista coffee bars dot the avenues. Over the past 15 years, India has become one of the fastestgrowing countries in the world, second only to China. In March, President George W. Bush made a three-day trip to the worldâ€™s largest democracy. (A democracy is a form of government in which people vote to elect their leaders.) There, Bush and Indiaâ€™s Prime Minister Manmohan Singh talked about science and technology, trade and investment, and a clean environment. They also agreed on an energy proposal that both countries hope will help India meet its rapidly growing demand for electricity. Experts predict that India will continue to grow, and by 2040 the country will boast the worldâ€™s third-largest economy, after the United States and China. The United States wants to develop a better business relationship with India. Bush believes that trade is important to help India overcome its poverty. Even though the economy there is improving, a large portion of the population is still poor. More than 300 million people in India live on less than $1 a day. That number of people is larger than the population of the United States. As India develops, it will require more electricity to power homes and businesses. Today, many cities in India suffer frequent blackouts because the country doesnâ€™t generate enough electricity. During Bushâ€™s visit, he and Singh made an important agreement. The United States will share nuclear technology and fuel with India. In return, India will allow international inspectors into 14 of its 22 nuclear plants (see ""What Is Nuclear Energy? ""). The plan will allow India to reduce its dependence on fossil fuels, such as oil and coal. Fossil fuels are formed in Earth from plant and animal remains over millions of years. In addition, the United States and India will work together to develop new technologies for producing clean and safe energy. The new agreement, however, is not a done deal. The changes still have to be approved by the U.S. Congress. Many U.S. leaders think India should not be allowed to have nuclear technology. India has refused to sign a treaty that outlines rules for using nuclear technology. However, Bush continues to emphasize the importance of trade with one of the worldâ€™s fastest-growing economies. In 2005, trade between India and the United States was $25 billion and is expected to reach $40 billion by 2009. ""The United States and India, separated by half the globe, are closer than ever before,"" Bush says. ""The partnership between our nations has the power to transform the world."" Currently, India gets 56 percent of its electricity from coal plants and just 3 percent from nuclear power. Coal, when burned, causes air pollution. Nuclear power plants, however, release almost no pollution. Nuclear energy is created by the splitting of the nucleus of an atom. That process is called nuclear fission. Many countries today use nuclear energy. Some experts predict that by 2050, nuclear power will provide 25 percent of Indiaâ€™s electricity."	4
"Nothing was going to stand in the way of Zeinab Sahib, a mother of three, as she voted on Iraqâ€™s constitution. She cast her ballot at a school in Baghdad, the war-torn countryâ€™s capital. ""I came to vote because I am tired of terrorists, and I want my country to be safe again,"" she says. Sahib was one of 7 million Iraqis who voted to accept or reject the new constitution on October 15. The ballots took days to count by hand, but the constitution passed. Seventy-eight percent of Iraqis voted to make the constitution the countryâ€™s new set of laws. ""It is a landmark day in the history of Iraq,"" White House spokesperson Scott McClellan told reporters. ""The political process is continuing to move forward in Iraq, and it is an encouraging sign to see more and more people participating in the process."" The new constitution marks a step toward establishing a democracy in Iraq since U.S.-led forces removed Saddam Hussein from power in 2003. A democracy is a type of government in which people vote for their leaders in elections. Bringing democracy to Iraq has been a challenge. Violent attacks continue throughout the country as insurgents, or rebels, try to prevent Iraq from becoming a democracy. More than 150,000 U.S. troops are stationed in Iraq, helping to bring peace and stability to the country. The U.S. military has also been training Iraqis to protect themselves from insurgents. Although the constitution was approved, the country is deeply divided. Not all Iraqis agree on how Iraq should be run. Iraq is made up of three major groups—Shiites (SHEE-ights), Sunnis (SOON-eez), and Kurds. Under Saddam Hussein, who was a Sunni, Shiites and Kurds had little voice in the government. The Shiites who live in southern Iraq and the Kurds who live in northern Iraq largely voted for the new constitution. The Sunnis, a minority group, live in the middle of the country and voted against it. Many Sunnis, who were in control during Saddam Husseinâ€™s rule, say the constitution favors Shiites and Kurds. The constitution allows the Shiites and Kurds to govern their own areas. Those regions have more oil than where most Sunnis live. The Sunnis worry that the Shiites and Kurds will control most of the oil and leave them weak and powerless. Along with granting more power to local governments, the new constitution allows Iraqis to vote for leaders every four years. On December 15, Iraqis will vote on a permanent government. They will choose a parliament, a lawmaking body, like the U.S. Congress. The new government will have the power to revise the draft constitution. If they decide to revise it, voters will have to approve the changes. As Iraqis begin running their own government, the United States hopes to begin withdrawing its troops. Since the war began three years ago, more than 2,000 U.S. troops have died. Recent polls show that support for the war has dropped and that many Americans want troops to come home. Others warn that the country still faces many obstacles on its path to stability. In the meantime, President George W. Bush praised the high participation in Iraqâ€™s vote. He says, ""The Iraqis are making inspiring progress toward building a democracy."""	4
"Aspen Wilson, 10, and Thorin Bell, 10, of Leavenworth, Washington, are a little too young to walk the halls of the United Nations. But they arenâ€™t too young to learn about becoming ambassadors. An ambassador is a person who represents his or her government in another country. The two boys were recently accepted to the People to People Student Ambassador Programs. They will travel to the United Kingdom for two weeks this summer. Thorin and Aspen will visit England, Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland. While in England, they plan to see a Shakespeare play and ride the huge London Eye Ferris wheel, which opened in 1999. They also will visit Oxford University, one of the oldest universities in the world. ""I hope to come back with the knowledge of how people live in other parts of the world,"" Thorin told Weekly Reader. He is looking forward to meeting new people and trying new foods in his first trip abroad. The goal of the student ambassador program is to help young people gain a better sense of what it means to be a good neighbor and a global citizen. Since the program was started in 1956 by President Dwight D. Eisenhower, thousands of U.S. kids and teens have represented their country overseas."	4
"Weekly Reader kid reporter Adam Obaid is gearing up for the Super Bowl. The 11-year-old from Salinas Middle School in Dearborn, Michigan, will report live from Super Bowl XL. Adam will interview players from both football teams before the big game at Ford Field in Detroit, Michigan. Then heâ€™ll watch from the press box as the action unfolds. Adam canâ€™t wait to set foot inside the stadium. Heâ€™s especially excited about ""watching the game up close,"" he says. You can read Adamâ€™s exclusive player interviews and Super Bowl coverage at www.weeklyreader.com."	4
"The lava waterfall from the Kilauea volcano spilled into the Pacific Ocean. Steam shot into the air as the lava hit the water. ""The cliff just caved away like a glacier,"" Hawaii Volcanoes National Park spokesperson Jim Gale told reporters. ""It just sheared off that old wall."" Park officials let tourists watch the spectacular scene well away from the danger zone. Kilauea, the worldâ€™s most active volcano, on Hawaiiâ€™s Big Island has been erupting continuously since 1983. The November collapse was the largest in 23 years. It took about four hours for the cliff to tumble into the ocean. As the lava hardened, it began to form new land. All the Hawaiian Islands formed that way. Thin strands of wiry volcanic glass, called Peleâ€™s hair, were found about 2,000 feet away. Peleâ€™s hair is a type of igneous rock, which forms from lava that cools and hardens. According to myth, Pele was the Hawaiian goddess of fire."	4
Hello Kitty is having the time of her life in Paris. Four thousand special gold and silver euro coins feature the famous feline in the French capital. The euro is the currency of 12 countries in Europe. One euro is equal to about $1.18. The coins feature five different designs. The most expensive coin is a 1-ounce gold coin. It is worth about $1,400! The coin shows Hello Kitty in a ballroom gown dancing with her boyfriend Daniel at the French palace Versailles (ver-SIGH).	4
"Germany, Chile, and Liberia donâ€™t seem to have much in common. The three countries lie on separate continents. They do not share a language, currency, culture, or history. But a closer look shows that the three nations are more similar than they may appear to be. In the past six months, each country has elected a woman as its leader for the first time in its history. Angela Merkel of Germany, Michelle Bachelet of Chile, and Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf of Liberia join a small but growing group of female heads of state. Only 11 of 193 countries in the world have women in charge. The three recently elected women have bold plans for their countries. Merkel, the first woman to serve as the chancellor of Germany, promised that the government would work to reduce unemployment, or joblessness, in her country. ""We want to give people hope of having jobs,"" she says. As the first woman president of Chile, Bachelet plans to bridge the large gap between the countryâ€™s rich people and poor people. She says, ""Chile needs to unite behind the goals of reducing poverty and creating more equal opportunities so that everyone can benefit from what the country has to offer."" Johnson-Sirleaf is not only Liberiaâ€™s first woman president. She is also the first elected female head of state in all of Africa. As president, she faces the huge task of rebuilding Liberia after 14 years of war. Although the war ended more than two years ago, the country still has no regular electricity or running water. More than 80 percent of the people in Liberia do not have jobs. Johnson-Sirleaf has vowed to reunite, or bring back together, her country. ""I am excited by the potential of what I represent—the aspirations and expectations of women in Liberia, African women, and women all over the world,"" she said in her inauguration speech. Those recent elections have made some Americans think about a woman president too. Nearly 80 percent of Americans are ready for a female commander in chief, according to a Roper Public Affairs poll. Some people think Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton of New York and U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice will run for president in 2008. Time will tell if the United States will have two female front-runners in that presidential election."	4
"Scientists are thrilled about some tiny, furry finds. They have discovered two new species of lemurs on Madagascar, an island located off the southeast coast of Africa. The endangered animals are found only in Madagascar and a few of the country's nearby islands. Madagascar is home to some of the world's most exotic, or unusual, plants and animals. Lemurs live mainly in forest trees and are nocturnal, or active at night. One of the newly discovered creatures has wide eyes, is small enough to fit in a hand, and bounces from tree branch to tree branch in the dark. Its name in Malagasy means ""good man."" Malagasy is the official language of Madagascar. The animal was named after scientist Steve Goodman. He has been studying the tiny creatures in Madagascar for 20 years. It is truly an honor to have an animal named after me,"" says Goodman. The other species is a giant mouse lemur with a bushy tail. It was named in honor of Madagascar's children. Its name in Malagasy means ""child."" The scientists chose that name to remind Madagascar's children to care for the many plants and animals in their country. Finding a new lemur species is rare because many of the tiny creatures have become extinct. The recent find means that there are now 49 known species of lemurs in the wild."	4
